
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Malm Kelp

This dark green variety of seaweed found in all five of Eorzea's seas has been known to grow up to a malm (1760 yalms) in length.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crayfish

A brown-carapaced freshwater crustacean commonly found in the rivers and lakes of Aldenard. So eager are crayfish to grasp at anything that may happen by, fishers boast that they need not even bait their lines to catch the creatures.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Chub

When spawning, the head, belly, and tail of this common freshwater fish take on a vibrant red hue─a color which, across Eorzea, traditionally represents happiness and longevity. Because of this, chubs are often given as gifts to newlyweds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Merlthor Goby

A vividly striped saltwater fish commonly found in the Strait of Merlthor. The gobies are situated near the bottom of the food chain and feed a great deal of larger species. This makes the fish an ideal choice for mooching.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lominsan Anchovy

For many generations, Lominsan anchovies were not actively caught, due to their insignificant size. However, after a Qiqirn deckhand discovered one rotting in the corner of the bilge hold on a fishing vessel and found it to be sublime, the demand for salt-cured Lominsan anchovies has risen dramatically.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Striped Goby

A brightly striped freshwater fish native to the rivers and lakes of the Coerthas and Mor Dhona regions. Coerthan legend states that the striped goby was not always a fish, but once a brightly plumed bird cast to the bottom of the seas by the Fury for flying too near Her realm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dwarf Catfish

An undersized variety of catfish found in still, swampy waters across Aldenard. The Padjali name for this fish is “gee-gee,” supposedly taken from the grinding sound created when it moves its fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Finger Shrimp

A common saltwater shrimp found in the plankton-rich waters of the Sea of Jade. Boiled in seawater and topped with a squeeze of fresh Thanalan sun lemon is the preferred method of preparation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bone Crayfish

A white-carapaced freshwater crustacean commonly found living in caves or deep lakes where sunlight is absent. After molting, the new shell is so thin and transparent that one can see the creature's organs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
White Coral

A piece of sharp coral native to the shallow seas all along Eorzea's coastlines. A literal treasure of the deep, white coral has been used for ages in not only jewelry, but sculptures and other works of art.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Princess Trout

Unlike other freshwater trout, which make their habitat in swift-flowing rivers, the silver princess trout prefers the relative seclusion of inland lakes. This has made the wavekin a favorite amongst recreational fishers who seek a more relaxing pastime.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ocean Cloud

A semi-transparent jellyfish commonly found in the Strait of Merlthor, where it goes through nine separate stages of development before reaching adulthood.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dusk Goby

A hardy species, the dusk goby can survive not only in freshwater, but also the mouths of rivers, where the tides can bring saltwater malms inland. Depending on the salt content of the water it lives in, the color of its scales can vary from a deep amber to a golden orange.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Cucumber

A purple, spiny, sluglike creature found in the shallows off of the island of Mazlaya, and treasured in the Far East as a delicacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Harbor Herring

This particular variety of herring will gather in busy harbors such as Limsa Lominsa's Galadion Bay to feed on the small sea creatures which consume the waste dumped from ships.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pipira

A fierce freshwater fish most commonly found in Gridania's Jadeite Flood and Black Tea Brook. Though not large or strong enough to inflict any real damage, pipira will bite the ankles of anyone who steps near them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Crayfish

A scarlet-carapaced freshwater crustacean commonly found in the streams and lakes of Vylbrand. The wavekin, however, is not born crimson─its shell slowly turning from blue to grey to brown to red as it ages.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vongola Clam

A bivalve mollusk native to the island of Bianaq, but found in all the five seas. Its rich, nutty flavor, in addition to its wide availability, have seen the vongola clam become a common addition to chowders and stews across Eorzea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gudgeon

Each night, this freshwater fish will use its fins to dig a shallow burrow in river or lake beds, where it will sleep, relatively safe from predators. Because of this characteristic, La Noscean fishers often playfully refer to the wavekin by another name─the “cravenfish.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coral Butterfly

A colorful saltwater fish commonly found in the warm seas around the island of Bianaq. Not known for its flavor, the wavekin is most often put on display in aquariums.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brass Loach

This long, thin, brass-colored freshwater fish is believed to be native to the rivers and lakes of the Yafaem Saltmoor. The thick coat of protective slime covering the loach's body discourages most predators from feeding on the tiny wavekin...most predators, that is, except hungry Lalafellin farmers who consider the brass loach a delicacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moraby Flounder

Legend states that once a normal fish, the flounder was stepped upon by the Wanderer during one of His journeys, and left for dead. Upon finding the fish, the Navigator succeeded in breathing life back into the denizen of the deep, but could not restore it from its new flattened form.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maiden Carp

Large schools of these dark silver fish can be found in the White Maiden and her tributaries. Their tendency to gather in great numbers makes them quite easy to catch, and as such they have been a staple for those living in the Twelveswood since the time of the first settlers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abalathian Smelt

A tiny freshwater fish native to the lakes and rivers fed by runoff from Abalathia's Spine. Too small to fillet, the fish are usually tossed into stewpots and eaten whole.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blindfish

Commonly found in sea caves and grottoes, the eyes of this freshwater fish regressed long ago, earning the specimen its name. As it has lost its ability of sight, it catches its prey, rather, by sensing changes in the flow of the water around it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pebble Crab

A small bluish grey crab found in tide pools along the La Noscean coast. Their tendency to cut fishing lines and steal bait from hooks makes these wavekin despised by fishers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mudskipper

An amphibious fish which can survive for bells out of water as long as its skin remains moist. When on land, the mudskipper uses its pectoral fins to “wander” about in search of shelter. Because of this trait, the fish is sometimes associated with the god Oschon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rainbow Trout

Found in the crystal-clear rivers and lakes of Mor Dhona and Coerthas, this fish's scales reflect all seven colors of the rainbow, making it difficult to locate in the water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
River Crab

A tiny freshwater crustacean commonly found in rivers throughout Eorzea. Known to feed on dead fish and algae, it is believed that if the river crab were ever to disappear, the realm's waters would quickly become fouled with corruption.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiger Cod

A striped saltwater fish indigenous to the cold northern waters of the Bloodbrine Sea. The name “tiger” is said to have been taken from a similarly striped beast native to the faraway jungles of Othard.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ala Mhigan Fighting Fish

A beautiful blue freshwater fish known for its violent disposition. When put in a pond or tank with another of its species, the two will battle each other until one is dead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Helmet Crab

This saltwater wavekin, most commonly found in the shallows of the Strait of Merlthor, is protected by a hard shell resembling a helmet. Renowned naturalist (assistant) Atelloune claims that (after slaying a few score) the shells share a similarity to those of diremites, and that therefore the two species must be related.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Faerie Bass

A common freshwater fish found in rivers and lakes in almost every corner of Eorzea. A staple for many of the realm's smallfolk.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Acorn Snail

Believed to have hitched a ride on the hull of a trade ship, the acorn snail is an invasive species originally from the New World, far to the west. As it has few natural predators in Eorzea, its numbers have exploded in recent years.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rothlyt Oyster

Also known as the milk of the sea, these tasty bivalve mollusks can be found on sea rocks all around Eorzea, but it is said the plumpest, most succulent grow in the nutrient-rich waters of the Rothlyt Sound.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Sleeper

A small freshwater fish originally from the eastern continent of Othard. It is said that the first dark sleeper was introduced to Eorzea by an exiled Lalafellin prince who wished to once again experience the luxuries of his homeland.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
La Noscean Perch

A fair-sized freshwater fish found distributed evenly throughout the lakes and rivers of lower Vylbrand. Is known to feed on minnows, making lures shaped like the tiny wavekin the perfect bait for landing a perch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigator's Dagger

These long, thin saltwater fish will oft jump out of the water and glide for yalms across the surface, using their pectoral fins as ersatz wings. Some fishers today still believe that the wavekin are knives thrown by Llymlaen at Her enemies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moat Carp

Historic records state that these carp were originally introduced to the Jadeite Flood to serve as food in the event of a siege. Legend has that a man in a faraway kingdom once caught ten thousand in a single sitting.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Angelfish

A small colorful fish native to the warmer waters of the seas near Meracydia. Since the Calamity, more and more have been caught off Eorzea's southern coastline.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Copperfish

The copperfish's dull orange scales─a hue rare in freshwater wavekin─make this species popular amongst Ul'dahn nobles, who apparently prefer even their fish the color of their coin. Not native to Eorzea, it is believed the first copperfish were brought to the realm by Far East traders.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bluebell Salmon

Hatched far up inland rivers, bluebell salmon will travel all the way downstream to the Indigo Deep where they will spend the majority of their adulthood. Then, however, when it comes time to spawn, they will return back upstream to the place of their birth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Razor Clam

A long bivalve mollusk most commonly found buried in the beaches of islands situated in the Rhotano Sea. They are known to leap out of their burrows when surprised or agitated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mudcrab

As its name implies, the mudcrab spends most of its life in the muddy freshwater shallows of swamps and moors. There are still some superstitious smallfolk who believe that the wavekin are actually the spawn of golems, and will go out of their way to crush them under rocks upon finding one.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Octopus

The somber blue tone of its skin does not indicate that this variety of octopus is any more docile than its crimson cousins. It is a crafty hunter which lurks in the shadows, snatching unwary prey and strangling it with its powerful eight arms before shredding it with its razor-sharp beak.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tricolored Carp

Patches of gold, silver, and bronze cover this medium-sized freshwater fish's body, making it a favorite choice for the private garden pools of Ul'dahn nobles. Without selective breeding practices, however, the tricolored carp will almost always lose its beautiful hues in the span of but a few generations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eunuch Crayfish

Thought to be born of blood spilled by Azeyma, the Warden, the grip of this tiny freshwater crustacean's claw is so strong, it has been the end of many a Lalafell's fingers...and more. Take care when handling.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jade Eel

Similar to salmon, this green-grey freshwater eel lives the majority of its life in the salty waters of the sea, returning to inland rivers to only spawn and die.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blowfish

A saltwater fish that, when provoked, blows up to three times its normal size to intimidate the would-be attacker. It is also known to have an organ which contains a potent silencing poison.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pond Mussel

This bivalve freshwater mollusk with a tear-shaped shell can be found either clinging to the side of submerged boulders or simply lying half-buried in the mud. As any impurity it consumes will remain in its body for the duration of its lifespan, the pond mussel can be used to determine the level of water corruption.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Warmwater Trout

This freshwater fish can only survive in tepid waters such as those heated by the flows of lava coursing beneath the mighty volcano O'Ghomoro or the desert sun of Thanalan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glass Perch

With an almost completely transparent body, this variety of freshwater perch is coveted by naturalists wishing to study the inner workings of organs on a living specimen.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Four-eyed Fish

Four-eyed fish do not actually have four eyes, but two eyes that are divided into an upper and lower portion that allow the wavekin to see both above and below the water at the same time. Contrary to popular belief, eating one will not improve or restore eyesight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Saber Sardine

This tiny saltwater fish travels in giant schools through the Indigo Deep searching for food. Its razor-like fins have been known to cut straight through the strongest of fishing nets.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Eel

Black eels reach maturity in the Sea of Jade, at which point they return back up the Velodyna and Hathoeva rivers to spawn. A popular ingredient in pies, these wavekin are best sought after at night, for they hide in holes and crevices during the daylight hours, only emerging to hunt after sunset.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Bass

This freshwater fish, known for its voracious appetite, is originally native to the southern continent of Meracydia. As its only natural predator is man, dark bass numbers have risen greatly in recent years, especially due to the increasing popularity of the faerie bass.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Coral

A piece of sharp coral native to the shallow coastal regions of the Rhotano Sea. Jewelry crafted from the material is oft given the name “Rhotano blue.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ogre Barracuda

A large saltwater wavekin that roams the sea in small schools, preying on smaller fish such as anchovies or sardines. Its name comes from fishers who claim that landing an ogre barracuda is more difficult than slaying an actual ogre.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aegis Shrimp

Whereas other shrimp shed their old exoskeletons each summer in favor of new ones, the aegis shrimp simply adds a new layer every year until the shell is so hard, not even a blow from a trained pugilist can break through it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Five-ilm Pleco

This freshwater fish commonly found in the rivers of the Black Shroud will often grow no larger than a mere five ilms.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkfish

This deep-sea-dwelling wavekin attracts its prey with a tiny glowing appendage protruding forth from its disfigured head, and then swallows the poor victim whole with its unnaturally large mouth. It is believed that the name comes from the resemblance of the appendage to the candles monks use when transcribing manuscripts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Bo

It is said that the naturalist who first discovered the wavekin wished to name it a “sea horse,” after a creature he once claimed to have seen on his travels in Ilsabard. However, when his colleagues all chided him, the crestfallen naturalist begrudgingly settled on the more common “chocobo.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Climbing Perch

Though not amphibious like the mudskipper, the climbing perch will jump from Black Shroud rivers onto low-lying tree branches in order to catch flies, beetles, and sometimes even small birds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadow Catfish

A large whiskered fish that can be found in the calm marshes of the Black Shroud. It uses those whiskers to sense the movement of nearby fish, waiting patiently until one swims directly in front of it. Once close enough, the catfish will open its massive maw and swallow its prey whole.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bianaq Bream

A cherry-colored saltwater fish found in abundance in all of Eorzea's five seas, though it is said those caught near Bianaq are the largest. The pinkish hue of its scales is thought to come from the finger shrimp upon which it preys.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Ghost

Native to the rivers and lakes of the Black Shroud, this freshwater fish uses electric receptors on its body to stun its prey. In recent years, Gridanian naturalists have begun to investigate the therapeutic properties of black ghosts, claiming that a few bells soaking in a lukewarm pool filled with the wavekin can cure various ailments.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Sole

A flat bottom-feeder commonly found in the frigid waters of the Bloodbrine Sea. It earns its name from its similarity in shape to the sole of a sandal. Fortunately, its flavor resembles nothing of its namesake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lamprey

A long, ugly freshwater eel found in nearly every river and lake in Eorzea. Its toothy grin is enough to frighten children across the realm. In Ul'dah, however, the fish is seen as a symbol of strength and dominance, and has long been a favorite amongst nobility and the wealthy classes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Plaguefish

This variety of freshwater fish has the queer habit of wearing the skulls of small drowned animals, though it is not known exactly why. Some believe that they are used to intimidate other plaguefish who seek to claim their territory. Others believe that they are messengers of Thal, beckoning lost souls to the afterlife.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hammerhead Shark

A ravenous shark with a hammer-shaped head it uses to quickly detect its prey. This wavekin is most commonly found living in small schools in the Strait of Merlthor, but there have been recent reports of schools containing more than five score of the creatures.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yugr'am Salmon

This freshwater fish matures in the salty waters of the Bloodbrine Sea, only to return up the Yugr'am River where it was born to spawn. Many beastkin are known to prey on the salmon that return to the rivers weakened by their long journey inland.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Pickle

A blue, spiny, sluglike creature found in the shallows off of Vylbrand, and considered a delicacy by Sea Wolves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spotted Pleco

Tiny white spots cover the body of this rare freshwater fish. The spotted pleco's mouth has uniquely adapted to allow it to better feed on the algae growing on underwater rocks and boulders.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lamp Marimo

A rare type of luminescent moss found on the bottom of lakes and in caves. Slight currents cause the moss to form into a ball as it grows. They are often shunned by uneducated smallfolk who believe them to be water-breathing will-o'-the-wisps.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Indigo Herring

This blue-backed, white-bellied saltwater fish native to the Indigo Deep is known to migrate in large schools from north to south in the winter, and back again in the summer. So plentiful is this variety of wavekin, that almost a third of the Fishermen's Guild's entire take during a season is said to be Indigo herring.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ropefish

As it has the tendency to coil up while inactive, this variety of freshwater eel is oft mistaken for lost boat rigging. Unlike most wavekin, the ropefish cannot survive underwater indefinitely, and must surface every several minutes to breathe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ash Tuna

A large saltwater fish known to migrate between the Sea of Jade and the Sea of Ash. In recent years, overfishing by boats from the Far East has led to a significant drop in their numbers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Grip Killifish

A rare type of fish found in harsh environments, such as the stagnant rainwater ponds collecting in the basin of Empty Heart on the western finger of the Gods' Grip.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bone Cleaner

A freshwater snail that survives solely on the carrion of animals that get caught and perish in the sucking mud of swamps and marshes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Root Skipper

A small fish that is found only in Rootslake in the Black Shroud. Similar to mudskippers, which can also survive outside of water, root skippers can be seen sunbathing and feeding on the exposed roots of the wood's giant sentinels.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leafy Seadragon

Though once found all across the five seas, seadragon numbers are now but a mere fraction of what they once were, due in part to Ishgardian culling parties.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonytongue

A single flat tooth on the bottom of this ancient freshwater species' mouth gives the bonytongue its name. Primitive drawings of this selfsame fish have been discovered in caves only recently unearthed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fullmoon Sardine

A tiny saltwater fish native to the waters of Vylbrand. Unlike other wavekin, they feed only at night, their activity increasing as Menphina waxes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitten Crab

The claws of this freshwater crustacean are covered in myriad tiny bristles which provide the illusion that the crab is wearing mittens.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Haraldr Haddock

A tasty saltwater fish indigenous to the cold waters of the Bloodbrine Sea. Its name comes from a legendary northern king who was said to have survived to the ripe old age of seven and fifty summers eating only the fatty flesh of this grotesque wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Monke Onke

A giant freshwater fish found in the tepid rivers and lakes of the Black Shroud. Gridanian records state that the first monke onke was brought to the Black Shroud by the realm's first Lalafellin settlers, the name monke onke meaning “friendship” in the settlers' native tongue.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seema

The flesh of this freshwater trout native to central and northern Eorzea is a bright pink, leading to the common nickname, “cherry trout.” Seema are frightened by even the slightest change in water flow and temperature, making them extremely difficult to catch by those other than the most tenacious.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whitelip Oyster

A bivalve mollusk found on the cliffs and rocks lining the Rhotano Sea. On rare occasions, sand will become trapped inside the shell and gradually form into a pearl. Enterprising Ul'dahn merchants have attempted numerous times, to no avail, to create pearls by introducing foreign objects to young shells with the hopes of harvesting treasure later on.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandfish

A tiny amphibious fish capable of breathing on land. This trait has allowed it to adapt to life in the deserts of Thanalan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silverfish

As are copperfish and goldfish, freshwater silverfish are prized amongst well-to-do Ul'dahns, and often kept as pets. Two score summers of crossbreeding were required to produce scales this lustrous.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Clown Loach

Bright patterns, similar to a clown's motley, cover this small freshwater fish from head to tail.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sand Bream

A tiny sand-dwelling fish which can spend its whole life out of the water, gathering the moisture it needs to survive from the trace amount of dew which seeps through the desert sands each dawn. Though given the name bream by those living in the desert, this fish actually has no similarities to the bream found in the sea, other than its size.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavender Remora

A violet-hued fish found in the warmer waters of Eorzea's southern seas. It will attach itself to sharks or whales using suction cups growing from its underbelly, and feed on the scraps left by its host.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Armored Pleco

The rock-hard scales of the armored pleco are thought to protect the wavekin from injury when being dashed about swift-water rapids. It also prevents other predators from preying on it, allowing the fish to grow undisturbed, sometimes for decades.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant Bass

Significantly larger than a dark bass, landing a giant bass can prove quite the challenge for even the most seasoned angler. Not known to feed on smaller worms or lures, fishers seeking to add this trophy to their cases will first need to catch a suitable bait.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Catfish

A large variety of air-breathing catfish. Its near-frictionless scales allow it to swim through the sand as a normal fish would through the water. As it traverses the sands, it will swallow a great deal of the stuff, filling the creature's belly and making it appear much larger than it actually is.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Balloonfish

A saltwater fish covered in scores of sharp spines, discouraging would-be predators from dining on this otherwise defenseless fry. Some fishers will also call them “sea bombs,” though none have ever been known to self-destruct.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Velodyna Carp

This scarlet cousin to the maiden carp can most commonly be found in the Velodyna and Hathoeva rivers. A favorite amongst Wildwood and Duskwight Elezen─amazingly one of the few things the clans actually agree on.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spotted Puffer

A cousin of the sea-dwelling balloonfish, spotted puffers are unique in that they can survive in the brackish waters of deltas and river mouths.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dustfish

When threatened, this sand-dwelling fish will beat the ground with its fins, kicking up a cloud of dust and allowing it the opportunity to escape unscathed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Loach

Truly a prize, this bright-gold fish, though rare, can be found in rivers and lakes across Eorzea. Despite fishers believing otherwise, naturalists insist that the golden loach is not a separate species, but merely a normal loach born with a pigment deficiency in its scales.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Storm Rider

These sand-dwelling fish will skip across the desert until they are fortunate enough to stumble across a sandstorm, in which case they will spread their fins and ride the storm great distances.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Trader Eel

This freshwater eel native to the rivers and lakes of Thanalan will often display the unique trait of swapping its mate with other nearby eels when spawning. Because of this characteristic, the wavekin is oft used in religious ceremonies involving Nald'thal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Trout

A red-scaled trout commonly found in the rivers originating on Abalathia's Spine. The color of its scales led past generations to believe that the wavekin fed on the blood of other fish. The theories of the current generation, however, are just as nonsensical, the most popular being that the crimson trout is a servant of Dalamud.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Discus

A colorful freshwater fish that can only survive in rivers located in more temperate climes. Though there is no proof, most believe that the fish was introduced to Eorzean waters by foreign traders from the south.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Antlion Slug

This sand-dwelling slug is able to maintain its mucous coating by absorbing the moisture from prey it catches at the bottom of conical pits not unlike the ones antlions are known to dig. A famous author once wrote a novel (that he claimed was based on fact) in which antlion slugs were actually intelligent rulers of an underground kingdom.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Coral

A piece of sharp coral, rarely found in any of Eorzea's five seas. The material is so rare, in fact, that it often fetches prices similar to those asked for garnets or rubies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bronze Lake Trout

This species of trout was once only found in Vylbrand's Bronze Lake. Naturalists attribute the spread of the wavekin into nearby rivers and ponds to birds who will catch Bronze Lake trout from the eponymous lake, only to let the fish fall from their talons when carrying them back to their nests.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ignus Snail

The fiery red shells of this freshwater snail, also known as “Ifrit's claws,” are prized by the Amalj'aa, and are useful when bartering with the beast tribe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dune Manta

Remarkably smooth skin allows the dune manta to glide through desert sands as though they were ocean waters. Its massive wings are used to envelop and smother its prey, which it then slowly devours with a tiny mouth that belies the actual size of the creature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silver Shark

A large, spindle-shaped shark commonly found in the Sea of Ash and known to attack much larger prey─such as fishers and sailors─without provocation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Loyal Pleco

This variety of striped freshwater fish earns its name from its tendency to gather by the legs of any man or beast who enters its habitat. Ul'dahns, on the other hand, will oft refer to the selfsame fish as the “royal pleco,” claiming that it received its name when a merchant presented the former sultan Sasabal one at his coronation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunderbolt Sculpin

A rare freshwater fish decorated with a thunderbolt-like pattern down its back. The Keepers of the Moon who inhabit the Black Shroud will eat one of these before a big hunt, claiming that it grants them speed and strength.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fall Jumper

Fall jumpers are born with an inherent tendency to swim against the current. When they arrive at rapids or falls, they have no option but to leap out of the water in an attempt to continue upstream. Some Ishgardians believe this ability was granted to the fish when a drop of blood from a wounded dragon fell into a river in Coerthas and was swallowed by a trout.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Knifefish

The freshwater knifefish is named such due to its resemblance, both in shape and color, to a flat blade. Unlike a knife, however, this wavekin is as sharp as a pumpkin, and has been known to swim right out of the water, only to suffocate onshore.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wahoo

A razor-fanged saltwater fish known to migrate throughout the warm waters of the Sea of Ash, following the schools of shrimp on which it feeds. While not considered a delicacy, the wahoo is treasured amongst alchemists who employ the bones and scales in several different medicines.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raincaller

This deep-blue freshwater fish can be seen sticking its head out of the water whenever it rains, leading people to believe it is the fish summoning the storm. However, naturalists have surmised that the fish are simply rising to the surface in search of food, mistaking the drops of water for insects.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oakroot

A giant freshwater fish found in inland lakes and rivers. Its name is derived from its resemblance to a knotty oaken root.

Found across Eorzea, this freshwater fish has highly developed fins and spines which not only protect the wavekin, but serve as weapons for hunting its prey which includes insects and other creatures.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blacklip Oyster

This bivalve mollusk was once as abundant in Eorzean waters as its white-lipped cousin. However, overfishing by Ul'dahn jewelers searching for black pearls has seen blacklip oyster numbers drop almost to zero.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Southern Pike

Though classified as a freshwater fish native to the Velodyna and Hathoeva rivers, this particular wavekin can survive in the brackish delta where the waterways spill into the Sea of Jade. The southern pike will eat almost anything that will fit in its mouth, including fish, shells, frogs, even squirrels and birds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern Pike

Though classified as a freshwater fish native to the White Maiden, this particular wavekin can survive in the brackish waters where the Maiden meets the Strait of Merlthor. The only difference between the northern pike and its cousin, the southern pike, is the color of their tails─the northern's being red, the southern's blue.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kobold Puffer

Similar to the spotted puffer, the kobold puffer can also survive in the brackish waters of deltas and river mouths. Its spots, however, are replaced with a hideous coat of bristly spines which give it the appearance of a bedraggled kobold.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nautilus

A giant cephalopod characterized by its spectacular whorled shell. Commonly found in the nutrient-rich Bay of Dha'yuz, the wavekin are thought by sailors and pirates to be the heralds of the Navigator, Llymlaen, and their shells are often carved into celebratory chalices.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Archerfish

When feeding, the archerfish will lift its head ever so slightly above a lake or river's surface and spit a stream of water up to a yalm to strike flies from low-lying branches into the water with remarkable accuracy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud Jellyfish

Cloud jellyfish aimlessly drift about the Sea of Clouds, tentacles spread out below them, searching for the small birds on which they feed. Naturalists conclude that the creatures are able to stay aloft by heating the air trapped inside their bodies, making it lighter than the surrounding winds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goblin Perch

The goblins claim that they brought this variety of perch back from their years-long pilgrimage into Othard and Ilsabard...because it tasted so divine.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Skyfish

One of the more common creatures found living on the thermal currents above the Sea of Clouds, from a distance, the skyfish appears to be no more than a simple rod outfitted with three sets of transparent wings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mummer Wrasse

This saltwater fish's name comes from the odd lump on its head, thought to resemble a mummer's motley cap. During mating season, adult males will butt their heads continuously until a female selects which she concludes has the hardest lump.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud Cutter

The swiftest inhabitants of the Sea of Clouds, cloud cutters will fly straight in a single direction for malms before quickly turning at some unthinkable angle and darting off in another direction. On rare occasions, they have been known to puncture the armor plating of airships.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Boltfish

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garpike

A hard-scaled freshwater fish native to southern Eorzea. The garpike is mentioned in the famous Raimdelle Codex, where it is described as a thirty-yalm monstrosity with two score hundred teeth and arms like a goobbue's. Fortunately for us, the garpike of Raimdelle's time is no more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blind Manta

A bottom-feeding flatfish, the plaice is most commonly found blending into the sands covering the sea floor near the Isles of Umbra, where, rather than pursuing its own prey, it waits for an unsuspecting fry to happen by.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilsabardian Bass

Unlike its Eorzean cousins, the Ilsabardian bass is mean-tempered and quick to bite, attacking other species sharing the same lake until there are none left but its own. Ill luck is said to come to all who gaze into its deep-red eyes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Paglth'an Discus

A brightly colored fish native to the warm waters in and around the Amalj'aa territory of Paglth'an. The fact that the wavekin has been spotted in locations distant from their stronghold has led Ul'dahn officials to worry that the beast tribe may be seeding other rivers and lakes with the fish in preparation for the Amalj'aa's advancement into those lands.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Boxing Pleco

The largest pleco known to naturalists, this variety is known for violently flailing its fins and ramming its head into any unfortunate creature that happens to swim by, especially during the spawning season.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rift Sailor

The rift sailor uses the light elastic webbing between its aetherially charged wings to catch the roiling winds of the Sea of Clouds and glide across the rifts. Spying one dart across your path is often regarded as an omen of good fortune.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Devil

Legends tell of giant sea devils emerging from the sea to wrap their many arms around ships and drag them to the abyss. This seems impossible today, as the largest catches in recent memory are little more than a yalm across.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kissing Trout

Native to the freshwater rivers of Abalathia's Spine, the kissing trout is famous for its mating “dance” in which a male and female will face each other for several moments before proceeding to couple.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Angry Pike

While all species of freshwater pike are known to be violent, this particular variety has been recorded actually biting clean through the ankle bones of wading fishers. The sheer ferocity of the angry pike has inspired many a hedge knight to take the wavekin as his sigil.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goldfish

The brilliant luster of this freshwater fish native to the Far East has made it a popular addition to the aquariums and garden ponds of Ul'dahn patricians. Once a rarity, recent overbreeding has seen a sharp drop in the market price for these wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sagolii Monkfish

When hunting, the Sagolii monkfish uses a method similar to its sea-bound cousin─attracting potential prey to its location with a glowing appendage situated directly above its gaping maw.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Saucerfish

Lacking feet or wings to propel itself from the ground, only death awaits the saucerfish that is foolish enough to leave the Sea of Clouds. Ishgardian legend says that the saucerfish are the descendants(?) of a plate of fish tossed out a window and into the Sea of Clouds by a finicky king.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Lobster

A large crimson crustacean commonly found hiding in the rocks off the shores of islands. The rich, flavorful tails are regarded as a delicacy across Eorzea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vampire Lampern

Just as its name implies, the vampire lampern is indeed a sucker of blood, using its multiple rows of teeth to latch onto its prey, whether it be sea or land creature, and bore a hole from which to drink.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wandering Sculpin

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goosefish

A large-mouthed saltwater glutton, thought to feed on most anything, from smaller fish, to seaweed, to the flesh of drowned sailors. Pullers despise these wavekin, for once they are caught in the pullers' nets, they will devour anything else caught with them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cave Cherax

It is said that not even a fishing line made from adamantite wire can withstand the cutting force of this legendary giant crustacean's claws.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coeurlfish

Two front teeth of this freshwater fish are exceptionally long and therefore protrude from the mouth, giving them the appearance of coeurl fangs. Fishers bitten by these wavekin will attribute those bites to a real coeurl rather than admit to their colleagues that they were had by their catch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Thalaos

Despite the modifier, the little Thalaos is anything but small; compared to the Thalaos of legend, even the largest of sea serpents would be deemed “little.” As is the case with most deep-ocean fish, its body is composed of a thick wax-like fat and little else, making it an unpleasant addition to any dinner table.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shall Shell

This enormous bivalve mollusk is easily recognizable by the unique wave pattern found on its outer shell. An old fisher's tale tells of a man who accidentally stepped in the mouth of one during low tide. Unable to move due to the shell's crushing force, the man eventually drowned when the tide came in.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sundisc

This freshwater fish has a bright-yellow sun-like pattern across its body, from which it takes its name. Revered as holy by the Amalj'aa, it is forbidden amongst the beast tribe to even lay eyes upon one, let alone catch, gut, and roast one over an open flame.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mahi-mahi

Its name meaning “stalwart” in the Lalafellin tongue, this deep-sea predator is not only massive, but deceptively fast. Some sailors swear that a mahi-mahi can make the journey from Meracydia to the Cieldalaes in less than a fortnight, though knowing most sailors, that claim may be slightly exaggerated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Halibut

While similar to the sole or plaice in appearance and behavior, the halibut is much larger than both, and can feed a Lalafellin family of five for several turns of the sun.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Alligator Garfish

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coelacanth

An ancient species of saltwater fish which appears to have flourished in times well before the Allagans built their empire. Thought normally to reside near the bottom of deep-sea trenches, the coelacanth has been known to rise to shallower waters in order to spawn─something it is believed the wavekin does only once during its hundred-summer lifespan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cadaver Carp

Neither dead nor necrophagous, the cadaver carp is called such because of where it chooses to live─some of the most tainted, noisome, and foul waters in all of Eorzea. Despite this fact, however, the flesh of the cadaver carp is actually quite tasty.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhamphorhynchus

Its massive lance-shaped nose makes this legendary denizen of the Sea of Clouds a formidable nuisance for airships passing through the area. Though not in any way, shape, or form a dragon, many Ishgardians believe the rhamphorhynchus to be a minion of the Dravanian Horde.

Emperor Fish

This giant freshwater fish lives out its adulthood feeding in the Indigo Deep before returning all the way back up to the head of the White Maiden to spawn.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bowfin

Heliobatis

A flat freshwater bottom-feeder found predominantly in marshes and swamps, where it can hide under the blanket of organic detritus collected on the floor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Megalodon

A legendary shark with a mouth so large and an appetite so enormous, it is said it can swallow an adult Roegadyn whole. This can be attested to by a former Roegadyn king who actually was swallowed whole by a megalodon before carving his way out of its belly with a dagger.

A giant freshwater fish so shrouded in mystery, that naught is known of it...except that it may take as many as five score years for the morinabaligi to mature...and that its eggs are delicious...and that those eggs are poisonous...and that this fact still does not prevent many adventuring elite from supping on the rare delicacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jungle Catfish

It is said that jungle catfish can grow to become as large as an aurochs, and while there are sightings aplenty of these massive specimens, one that large has yet to be caught.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiny Tortoise

Not native to Eorzea, the first adamantoise to arrive in the realm is believed to have been mixed in with a shipment of dodo eggs from the Near East. Why anyone would import dodo eggs when there are more than enough of the birds living in Eorzea already is a mystery for the ages...but the whole affair more than likely involves a hungry Qiqirn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gigantpole

Though able to levitate while in tadpole form, the gigantoad loses this biologically unexplainable characteristic the moment it sprouts legs and gravity remembers its duty. It is, however, all for the better, because really, who wants to encounter a flying gigantoad while traipsing through the wilderness?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zalera

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Greatest Bream in the World

This is not the greatest bream in the world; this is just a tribute. In the Far East, it is common custom that when an especially large bream is landed it be offered to the area's liege lord in thanks for allowing his waters to be fished. So as not to insult the lord, the catch is oft presented under the pretense that it is “greatest in the world.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dirty Herry

Whereas most herring have an expected lifespan of little more than twelve moons, this clever kipper has seen more than thrice that amount due to his ability to maneuver his way through schools so as to place himself far from danger, yet close to dinner.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Old Hollow Eyes

Amalj'aa claim this plaguefish earned its grim headpiece after slaying a grown battle drake that came to water at Burnt Lizard Creek. That this is even possible is highly debatable, but one theory has the fish attaching itself to the soft fleshy area beneath the scalekin's neck and sucking its blood until rendering it unconscious.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sylphsbane

Instead of utilizing its inherent tendency to propel itself from the water and scale tiny waterfalls, this particular troublemaker will, for reasons unknown, leap forth only to strike at sylphs who have wandered too close to its home. To this date, however, the only injuries recorded as a result of the odd attacks have been to fragile egos.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Floating Boulder

While the ability to jump from the water to low-lying branches benefits the climbing perch by providing it with increased feeding options, it also puts it in danger of being carried off itself by a bird of prey. The floating boulder, however, has found that a steady diet of tree-dwelling insects makes it far too heavy to succumb to a predator's talons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Grinner

This ancient carp has survived many a fisher's greedy grasp by violently twisting and turning to snap line from bait, leaving the wavekin with an unnatural grin begot by the countless hooks left buried in its maw.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shark Tuna

Upon witnessing this massive wavekin hungrily navigate the shallow waters beneath his privy, self-made entrepreneur Gegeruju (a man not particularly known for his talents in the field of christening), dubbed the creature “shark tuna,” inciting a flurry of wild applause from the old Lalafell's cadre of sycophants.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Worm of Nym

Carvings discovered on the walls of ruins dotting the outer La Noscean landscape suggest that a giant eel-like creature has been terrorizing the people of this land since the peak of the Nymian civilization. Whether this particular specimen is an offspring of said creature─or in fact the creature itself─alas cannot be determined.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Twitchbeard

Lominsan legend has that the pirate king Mistbeard bred this octopus to its enormous size by feeding it the corpses of his countless victims. He then released the kraken into the secret cove where his plunder lay hidden, so that all who dared seek the booty would meet their doom.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Warden's Wand

There is an age-old Lalafellin faerie tale which tells the story of a trader eel who swam so far upstream that he eventually arrived at the very gates of the goddess Azeyma's palace. So impressed was the Warden with the wavekin's perseverance, that She gifted him with a cloak woven from rays of the sun.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spearnose

The spear-shaped nose of this rare wavekin is not actually a nose, but the creature's mouth─a mouth not actually used to spear prey, but to suck it forth from between rocks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Levinlight

This unique variety of spotted pleco has learned to wield the trace amounts of aether within its body to emit a soft glow from its mottles, by which it attracts its prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sinker

Unlike his brethren who, after hatching, navigate their way downstream in search of food, the Sinker instead chooses to remain near spawning grounds where he can feed alone without worry of rivals. His tendency to remain motionless on the riverbed has given “rise” to his playful moniker.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gobfather

There is not a goblin fisher in all Eorzea who does not dream of one day landing the legendary don of the deep. That road, however, is long and filled with peril, for it is rumored that those who make it their purpose to seek the great perch oft vanish, never to return again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweetnewt

When attacked, this carnivorous amphibian will release an aromatic substance from its pores that either drives the would-be predator away in disgust, or tempts the creature to feed upon the newt. The sweet secretions, however, are highly toxic, and cause instant paralysis upon ingestion, rendering the predator into the prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bombardfish

Playfully named after the giant voidsent which terrorized the realm in the final years of the Sixth Astral Era, we should not be frightened of the size of this balloonfish, but the size of what this balloonfish encountered to cause it to swell to its current diameter.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Salter

A stickler for the precise commixture of salt- and freshwater, this particular puffer will not tarry in one location overlong, swimming hither and thither so as to remain within currents of the desired concentration. To even have a chance of predicting its erratic course, one must learn to read not only the tides, but the skies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lone Ripper

By shunning its natural instinct to travel and feed in schools, this hammerhead shark can devour prey in its entirety, allowing for growth to a size heretofore unseen in its species. The Lone Ripper will oft hunt during times of storm, as the froth created by the churning of the waves causes disorientation in smaller fish, making them easier to catch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
King of the Spring

Having found a secluded hydrothermal plume at the bottom of Bronze Lake, this trout will spend the greater part of each day motionless, feeding on the tiny creatures which are drawn to the heated waters.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Discobolus

Scars up and down the discobolus's back reveal a lifetime of heated battles with gig-wielding Amalj'aa warriors. That a fish which, on the outside, appears no different from any other can withstand the rending of its flesh is an attestation of the species' resilience.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Iron Noose

Scales like metal and a spine tougher than any sailor's rope have seen this ropefish survive far more summers than is common in the species. It has even learned to better conserve the air it intakes, so that it need not rise to the surface overmuch, further prolonging its life.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Olgoi-Khorkhoi

Deep beneath the sands of the Sagolii Desert lurks a beast so terrible, the huntresses of Forgotten Spring's U tribe only speak of it in whispers, for it is said that to merely utter the name Olgoi-Khorkhoi is to bring ill fortune upon your kith and kin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Carpet

Every night around the communal bonfires, children of the U tribe are regaled with epic tales of ancient battles fought by wizards riding the backs of magicked dune mantas. If the children's claims are to be believed, such mantas still swim the dunes of the Sagolii as they did in ages past.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Daniffen's Mark

The Ishgardian legend of Saint Daniffen tells us that the dragoon would oft practice his lancework on the shores of the mighty Coerthas River. To better his aim that it might always be true, he sought only the nimblest of seema to serve as his marks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Charon's Lantern

Uneducated smallfolk across the realm are vindicated upon learning that while normal lamp marimo have no relation to will-o'-the-wisps or other phantasmal apparitions, this particular ball of moss, after being accidentally devoured (and then subsequently excreted) by the souleater Rongeur, is now harboring several of the beast's stolen spirits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Green Jester

A night in the foul belly of a morbol was not nearly enough to finish off this hardy loach, and if anything he emerged from the seedkin's nethers the following morn even stronger, if not a touch more green.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloodbath

In her attempt to stay the hands of time, Lady Amandine would not only bathe in the blood of maidens, but the blood of just about anything she believed had skin more smooth or supple than hers─including forest fauna. As a result, especially plump monke onke were poached to near extinction at the behest of the vainglorious crone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Son of Levin

There is a song sung by the sylphs which tells of a magnificent wavekin caught in the Black Shroud and presented to their lord, Ramuh, as an offering. Taken by its beauty, the Lord of Levin judged that the fish was slain before its time, and granted it life anew. To see it go untouched for all eternity, he took it as his son.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thundergut

Kobold legend tells of Thundergut─a mighty sculpin whose gluttony knows no bounds. He swallows the thunder from the clouds before it can manifest, and it is because of this insatiable greed that La Noscean storms are silent save for the falling of the rain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Drowned Sniper

The archerfish is already known for its uncanny ability to pick off targets from afar. This particular specimen, however, is said to never have missed a target, leading to rumors that the wavekin is possessed by the spirit of a famous local marksman who was drowned in the Agelyss River by his wife after being caught bathing with a young maiden.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Terpsichorean

When selecting a mate, female mitten crabs will look no further than a male's claws. To make their mittens appear larger than they actually are, some males will put on a dance in which they wave their arms back and forth─a technique that works surprisingly well, as can be attested by all the baby crabs in Raincatcher Gully bearing the Terpsichorean's features.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mirrorscale

This silverfish's scales are so polished that predators are oft frightened away by their own reflections. It is believed that this level of brilliance is maintained by Mirrorscale rubbing his body in the fine ashen sands deposited by nearby O'Ghomoro's frequent eruptions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Helmsman's Hand

“From the Deep rose Helmsman's Hand
For to aid Lady Bloefhiswyn.
In his wake, she set her course
And lo, was led to foreign shores.”

From <Emphasis>O'er Westward Seas</Emphasis>
  ─Gilbert Goldenlocks, 1556 Sixth Astral Era


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Thousand-year Itch

So loyal is this pleco, that it is said if abandoned, the wavekin will curse his owners, bringing them and their families a thousand years of misfortune. Considering the pleco only has an average lifespan of a few summers, it is best to keep the pet to its end, rather than suffer a fate worse than death.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hannibal

After devouring all the other types of fish in his Bluefog hole, he set his sights upon his brother and sister garfish until they, too, were no more. Now, he tempts fate by purposefully nibbling on fishers' lines, so as to entice his victims into approaching the water where he might drag the pour soul into his trap.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Maiden

Ishgardian knights claim that if one catches the Warden kissing the dawn maiden at daybreak, the skies will be clear of dragons for the sun's full turn. It is not mentioned what might happen if the dawn maiden were to be caught by an ambitious angler.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Starbright

The spotting on this otherwise inconspicuous kissing trout will glow a brilliant white when struck by the light of the moon, leading fishers to believe the fish to be blessed by the goddess Nymeia Herself. It has been noted that this divine illumination has no effect on flavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matriarch

The mother of a thousand spawn, this hot-blooded smelt swore revenge against mankind the very morning she woke to find her children being hauled away in a trawler's net. How she plans on exacting this revenge is yet to be determined. Please look forward to it!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadowstreak

For generations, fishers would tell their sons and their grandsons tales of Shadowstreak, an elusive pike ten yalms long and half as wide, with a maw large enough to swallow a pregnant bison whole, and fins sharp enough to cut through rock plated in steel-covered iron─with eyes that will snatch a man's soul from his bosom and a cry that will turn a babe's hair white.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Captain's Chalice

Becoming a successful pirate is not as simple as merely procuring the three Ps─a parrot, a patch, and a peg leg. No, a true pirate needs a proper receptacle from which he (or she) will sip his (or her) grog, and what better a chalice than one carved from the shell of a giant nautilus?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Anomalocaris

At the apex of the Sea of Clouds food chain soars the anomalocaris, a breed of rift sailor that catches its prey by rising thermals high up into the heavens, and then plummeting headfirst into unsuspecting cloudkin before they have time to react. So beautiful is this predatory dance, that bards have written numerous ballads detailing its erotic intricacies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frilled Shark

An ancient breed of shark thought to have descended from the giant scalekin which roamed Hydaelyn in the age before the Navigator, Llymlaen, summoned the serpent to fill the world's seas. Its multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth are arrayed in a pattern so complex that once caught in them, nothing short of excising the affected area will free it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aetherlouse

A denizen of the deepest, darkest reaches of the abyss, where few creatures dwell, the aetherlouse has adapted its diet to include the minute traces of residue from underwater aetherial nodes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Imperial Goldfish

One might think that a body covered in glittering gold scales would make the imperial goldfish a prime target for larger predators such as the jungle catfish...and they would be absolutely correct. The reason this specimen has survived so long is due to its ability to remain completely motionless when danger lurks nearby.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Old Man in the Sea

This giant marlin earned its name after a legendary struggle with one of the realm's most famous fishers. For three days and three nights the grizzled Sea Wolf battled the stubborn marlin, neither showing any sign of yielding, until the old man lost his footing and tumbled into the sea. There he remains to this day─dragged by the marlin, hands still tight around his rod.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nepto Dragon

Erratic flows of aether released after the Calamity not only resulted in a warping of the landscape, but of the creatures that dwell upon it as well. Such is the case of the Nepto Dragon─a little Thalaos grown to epic proportions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coelacanthus

A slightly larger, slightly older, slightly more elusive cousin to the coelacanth, the deep-sea coelacanthus will only rise to the ocean's surface to feed on nights when the moon is hidden behind a veil of clouds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Endoceras

So rare is this spear-shaped wavekin that ten summers may pass before one is caught in a lucky puller's net or found suctioned to the hull of a warship.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seahag

When Sahagin hatch, they are all inspected by the elders for signs of weakness. If the spawn is not deemed in proper health, it is cast into the deep as an offering to the seahag─a massive fish the beast tribe believes to harbor the spirit of a legendary hero.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ignus Horn

A staple of the Amalj'aa diet, ignus snails rarely grow larger than a few ilms in length before being collected and thrown into a steaming pot of Trader vetch and scrubgrass. When allowed to thrive, however, they can achieve unthinkable sizes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Void Bass

On rare occasions a dark mist will settle over areas of Eorzea hit hardest by the corrupting hands of the Calamity. This mist is commonly referred to by skywatchers as “gloom” and is believed to be umbrally charged aether drawn forth from the void itself. That the void bass is drawn to the gloom may be evidence of the wavekin's true origins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cornelia

As pugilists the realm wide exchange tales of the mighty Cornelia─brawler of legend─so, too, do fishers speak of the cornelia─a boxing pleco who will only leave her place among the rocks when all other pleco have been sent down for the count.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ninja Betta

Taking its name from the professional assassins of the Far East, the ninja betta will protect its territory by swallowing whole anything that comes within several yalms of the wavekin...including other assassin betta.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Canavan

Most wavekin, with the exception of tortoises (which some scholars refuse to classify as wavekin), have a life expectancy of little more than a few summers. Canavan, however, is said to have seen more than five score. How this morinabaligi has survived so long may have to do with its extremely selective diet.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kuno the Killer

At constant war with Canavan for supremacy of nearby hunting waters, Kuno the Killer is as much a “killer” as any creature of the forest who survives by feeding on lesser prey. However, Kuno the Eater did not quite carry the same weight as Kuno the Killer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pirate's Bane

The legend of the Pirate's Bane is filled with colorful tales of reaver hulls swollen with plunder being torn open and emptied into the bottomless deep.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ndendecki

Since wandering into a natural cavern that also happened to be the lair of several escaped hecatoncheires, this gargantuan snapping turtle has terrorized his neighbors by severing the members of those stubborn enough to use his wading pool as a privy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bat-o'-Nine-Tails

This bloodsucking eel has perfected a whip-like motion it performs with its tail to stun its prey, allowing the wavekin ample time to latch itself onto the soft underbellies of its prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wootz Knifefish Zenith

After the first several sightings of particularly opalescent wootz knifefish swimming in a ceruleum-tainted pool, rumors that an adventurer had dropped her bottle of Thavnairian mist into the water began to spread. Scholars, however, have been quick to refute these claims, stating that if this were possible, local markets would be filled with jerked beef zenith.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Helicoprion

Unlike those of most creatures in Eorzea, the teeth of the helicoprion never cease growing, nor do they ever fall out. The result of this painful phenomenon is a maw filled with a swirling set of curved blades that resembles the inner workings of some strange machina from a forgotten age.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkstar

A life of dwelling in the pitch-black depths of the abyss have rendered this pike's eyes unusually sensitive to light, to the point where even a single lamp marimo will drive the wavekin into the darkest recesses of the sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Corpse

To survive the extreme cold of Coerthas, this strange breed of wavekin will shut down all but the most vital of bodily functions and remain on the lakebed, unmoving, conserving its energy until the sun warms the waters enough to allow for hunting.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mahar

Despite the fact rhamphorhynchus make no audible cries, they are known to form highly complex flocks when hunting. Realm nephologists attest this to an advanced form of communication through thought projection initiated by an alpha male─Mahar being one─and imitated through the flock by the lesser members.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shonisaurus

At a recent symposium held for nephologists, biologists, and other scholars of the Sea of Clouds, naturalist Marcette Manne presented a thesis claiming that the Raimdelle's classification of the shonisaurus as a cloudkin is mistaken, and that the creature is, in fact, a scalekin. Needless to say, she was laughed off the stage by her peers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magicked Mushroom

With over a thousand different varieties of funguar documented in Eorzea alone, the probability that sooner or later an unknowing mushroom crab will collect the spores of a particularly nasty species is higher than one might think. And, that which does not kill the crab can only make him more magical.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant Takitaro

Tales of a massive takitaro living in the waters of the Black Shroud once had fishers flocking to the forest in search of the wavekin...until it was learned that the tale was started by a drunken boar hunter who hit his head after falling into Urth's Fount with his faithful bloodhound (who had also been drinking from the hunter's wineskin).


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Namitaro

Determined to retain his claim to the underwater throne of Urth's Fount, the namitaro is in a constant battle with similarly legendary fish that reside in the holy lake. So large is the namitaro's dorsal fin that it can create fulm-high waves simply by turning.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Red Bonytongue

Knowing that its bright-red skin might alert potential prey to its presence, the too-clever-by-half blood red bonytongue will only hunt during foggy conditions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gigant Clam

After overhearing a drunk fisher claim to his equally drunk shipmate that one of the massive mollusks gnawed the leg (or was it head?) off his infant son, a newly instated Yellowjacket sergeant looking to impress his superiors took it upon himself to order his men to locate and destroy as many of the wavekin as possible, leaving the population decimated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Icepick

While the severe climate change following the Calamity resulted in the disappearance of most smelt from Coerthas, some of the species adapted, and now thrive in the frigid waters. The icepick is one such example, its long beak-like mouth allowing it to break through underwater ice in order to feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud Coral

This bone white cliff-dwelling coral withstands the constant battering of the Sea of Clouds' winds by hiding within a lightweight, yet remarkably sturdy exoskeleton, emerging to feed only when the weather permits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ice Faerie

Despite its angelic appearance, this tiny transparent sea slug is a ferocious predator which uses a circle of razor-sharp teeth to slice up its prey as it swallows it whole. This furious display has resulted in a second name─Halone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Skyworm

It is believed that this cylindrical vilekin can locate and devour wind-aspected aether in the Sea of Clouds, in turn, making the creature lighter than air. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coerthan Crab

Once only found in the glacial lakes that pepper Abalathia's Spine, the everlasting winter currently overtaking Coerthas has drawn the crustaceans down from the mountains and into the highlands where they have fewer natural enemies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fanged Clam

When closed tight, the thick shell of this freshwater mollusk creates an insulated sanctuary up to ten times warmer than the surrounding waters. Any fingers caught in the clenching maw of the fanged clam will not be returned to their owner.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lake Urchin

Coerthan legend tells of a brave priest who would rush into battle headlong with his copy of the <Emphasis>Enchiridion</Emphasis> in one hand and a morningstar in the other. So frenzied was his slashing and whirling of the weapon, that often the spiked ball would fly from its chain and into nearby rivers and lakes. Lake urchins have nothing to do with this legend.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whilom Catfish

This variety of warmwater catfish has scales of deep crimson which allow it to better conceal itself in the Whilom River's red clay bed. To hunt, it will sit unmoving until a smaller fish, unaware of the camouflaged wavekin's presence, comes along and impales itself upon one of the spines lining the catfish's dorsal fin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blueclaw Shrimp

This freshwater shrimp uses its long, powerful claws to not only tear mussels from the rocks they are attached, but also pry them open and slice the containing flesh clean from the shells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Starflower

Another of the Sea of Clouds' strange creatures, the starflower uses the thin blue membrane covering its body as both a sail and parachute, allowing for extended periods of wingless flight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glacier Core

Concerning the origins of the glacier core, there are two differing theories. One is that the icy beings are the undeveloped larvae of ice sprites. The other is that they are not living creatures at all, but lightweight spheres of manifested aether, not unlike crystals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ogre Horn Snail

Unable to survive in cold temperatures, the only ogre horn snails left in Coerthas are those which live in the warm waters of thermal springs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorcerer Fish

The sorcerer fish has the uncanny ability to manipulate the fire-aspected aether naturally occurring in its sanguine humours to warm the water around its body. This allows the wavekin to survive in temperatures that would most certainly mean death for lesser species.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hotrod

The hotrod is similar to the sorcerer fish in that it channels the fire-aspected aether found in its sanguine humours and concentrates it in the whiskers found near its head. The whiskers can then be used as a weapon to stun or even injure prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maiboi

Meaning “thin one” in the Vanu tongue, maiboi are a symbol of weakness amongst the tribes of Abalathia, and to be called a maiboi by your kin is often considered the greatest of insults.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Three-lip Carp

When feeding, the skin surrounding the maw of this deadly freshwater carp unfolds in three separate locations, creating a massive sac from which prey are unable to escape. The only known predator of the wavekin is the even deadlier pipira pira.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bullfrog

So similar is a bullfrog's croak to the deep mating low of a wisent, that cows have been known to stumble into lakes at night. Though the perfect bait for mooching, these amphibious wavekin are also a delicacy amongst the Vanu tribes and often only served at guest-welcoming rituals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloudfish

The Vanu believe that these fish are born of the fine rainless clouds that fill the sky in the summer months. While living, their bodies remain translucent. When taken from the water, however, the translucence is lost and the cloudfish's skin turns pure white.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mahu Wai

Mahu wai grow from the floating islands of Abalathia's Spine, releasing scores of thin transparent tendrils into the sky to catch their prey and haul it back to their giant maws. The word mahu wai means “bottomless greed” in the Vanu tongue.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Mussel

Too small to warrant shucking, those who hunt the lands of Dravania instead prefer to use the mussels to make a flavorful broth which is added to other dishes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Buoyant Oviform

Pride preventing them from using the widely accepted moniker, Eorzean naturalists have come up with a much more scholarly, if no more informative, alternative to “flying egg.” As to understanding what the buoyant oviform actually is, how it flies, and how it survives...very little progress has been made.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whiteloom

There is debate over whether this denizen of the Sea of Clouds is called a whiteloom or a whiteroom. Proponents of the former point to the spinning and weaving motions the creature makes when airborne. Proponents of the latter claim that one only need gaze upon the creature's fungus-like shape to realize that they have the right of it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Cloud Coral

This blue variety of cloud coral is harvested in great numbers by the Vanu tribes of Abalathia and ground into a fine blue powder. The powder is mixed with spring water and spores of the morrowmote to create a thick paste which is generously applied to the beaks of shamans before rituals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seema Patrician

Spending most of their lives in near-freezing waters have lined the bodies of seema patricians with a thick layer of fatty tissue which is highly sought after by Ishgardian nobles who believe the foul-smelling oil to soften skin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ammonite

An inland cousin of the nautilus, the ammonite has developed a two-layered shell which it fills with water heated by its own body. This insulates the creature from the cold, allowing it to survive in the cold northern climes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bubble Eye

By separating its eyes from its head, the bubble eye goldfish is able to see in far more directions than other wavekin─a trait invaluable in waters where predators might approach from any direction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Grass Carp

As the name implies, grass carp dine solely on water grasses, shunning the carnivorous eating habits of their cousins for a healthier diet. Unfortunately, this diet gives the fish a very bitter flavor, making it unsuitable for consumption.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pipira Pira

An exceptionally ravenous variety of pipira, the pipira pira have been known to bite clean through the ankles of chocobo herds fording rivers containing schools of the deadly wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dravanian Squeaker

A unique variety of brightly mottled catfish which swims upside down in order to confuse both prey and predators.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kissing Fish

To the layman's eye, the repeated pressing of perpetually puckered mouths by two of these wavekin appears to be an act of affection, when in fact, it is heated territorial dispute.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mitre Slug

Recently discovered and named by knights of House Haillenarte dispatched to explore the islets floating above Ishgard, the shells of these snail-like creatures bear a close resemblance with the holy mitre worn by the archbishop.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lava Crab

Only recently discovered, natural scholars are still at a loss as to how any creature, this crab included, can survive in scalding liquid rock. Tests conducted by the Thaumaturges' Guild have found that the hard carapace can withstand heat up to that generated by Fire IV.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Storm Core

Similar to glacier cores, but with an elemental aspect of lightning instead of ice, the Vanu Vanu have, for generations, captured storm cores and placed them in baskets to serve as lighting for their homes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scholar Sculpin

Before abandoning their city–state, the Sharlayans would utilize this sculpin's natural tendency to swim back and forth between two unchanging locations in search of prey to deliver messages up and down the Thaliak River.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gigant Grouper

A highly intelligent wavekin with an enormous appetite, the gigant grouper will repeatedly butt its head against the underside of a frozen lake, weakening the ice so that when a large creature such as a polar bear lumbers by, it will fall through, providing a hearty meal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vanuhead

The first explorers of the floating Abalathian island mistook this fish with a massive lump upon its forehead to be a diving Vanu Vanu, hence the moniker. Interestingly enough, the Vanu Vanu call this fish “duku'moii,” which means “swimming bottom dweller.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marble Oscar

Marble oscars will often gather in water that has been clouded by spilled blood, leading the Gnath to believe the wavekin a loyal servant of the Lord of the Hive, Ravana.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lungfish

Unlike gigantoads, newts, or nankas which, by exhibiting properties of both wave- and scalekin, are able to survive in and out of water, the lungfish is a rare example of a wavekin that, despite being void of scalekin properties, can still survive for extended periods on dry land─sometimes for several summers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tigerfish

This violent freshwater fish was dubbed the tigerfish by a group of Auri travelers who claim the striped pattern on the wavekin's back resembles that of a Far Eastern beast known as a tiger.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sky Faerie

While many an Ishgardian lay has been sung about the beauty of these ephemeral creatures, sky faeries are detested by the Vanu tribes of Abalathia who find them to be grotesque and misshapen monstrosities.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Granite Crab

Granite crabs will not eat raw meat and have been witnessed drawing land-dwelling prey into magma before devouring it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aithon's Colt

Believed by some to be the son of the legendary steed Aithon, this lava-dwelling creature's body is shielded by a layer of thick glass which aids its movement in the magma.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shipworm

A shell-less bivalve mollusk notorious for boring into ship hulls. Despite the use of protective measures such as ironwood bug shoes or metal plating, the vermiform creatures will eventually find a way into any ship, slowly consuming it from the inside.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hedgemole Cricket

This tiny vilekin has the capacity to live on both land and in water, using its powerful barbed forelegs to both burrow and to swim. Its reproductive capacity is immense; however, since both fish and birds feed on the cricket, its population remains fairly controlled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mogpom

A distant cousin to the lamp marimo, moogles will avoid mogpoms at all costs, believing them to be the discarded poms of their fallen comrades.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magma Tree

While similar in appearance to coral, magma trees are actually giant colonies of tiny creatures encased in heat-resistant crystal which feed upon the essence of ore melted in the magma within which they reside.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud Rider

Unlike their lower-altitude cousins the cloud cutters, cloud riders will not fly in straight trajectories, but rather skip across the tops of clouds, tapping into the clouds' wind-aspected aether to propel themselves through the skies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dravanian Bass

Fishers who are brave enough to venture into the largely untouched areas west of Ishgard are rewarded with specimens like the Dravanian bass which are known to almost always put up a good fight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coerthan Puffer

An extremely rare form of freshwater puffer found only in the cold waters beyond the Coerthas lowlands. Ishgardian nobles believe that the fish bring fortune, and many have elaborate tanks built in their manors so that they may gaze upon the wavekin as they count their gil.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Snowcaller

The snowcaller will wait in the mud at the bottom of lakes until the water temperature drops, numbing the movement of those fish who are less tolerant to the cold. It is then that the snowcaller will rise from its warm bed and attack.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragonhead

The dragonhead is one of many varieties of Eorzean fish that wear the skulls of small animals fallen into the water. The skulls are thought to not only frighten away predators, but also protect the head from potentially fatal bites.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mercy Staff

The debate over whether the mercy staff feeds when it snows, or it snows when the mercy staff feeds, was seemingly put to an end when reports emerged of a Coerthan fisher catching three of the wavekin under fair skies, only to be buried in a snowstorm on his way home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rime Eater

In Coerthas it is five winters' bad luck to slay a rime eater, for the creatures feed on the glacier cores that the smallfolk believe to be the cause of snowstorms.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Warmwater Bichir

This breed of ancient wavekin is covered in brilliant diamond-shaped scales that blind potential predators. Bichirs feed solely on water-skipping vilekin, making them much hated by the Gnath, who will spear them merely out of spite and leave the corpses to rot in the water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Noontide Oscar

No more than a marble oscar lacking pigment, noontide oscars are rare finds simply for the fact that they are unable to blend in with their surroundings, making them more visible to predators. There are those, however, who claim the bone white wavekin possess special powers, making them highly sought after by witches and medicine men.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadowhisker

One cannot visit a tavern in all of Coerthas without hearing tall tales of the great man-eating shadowhisker. In one village, the fish will be five yalms long, in another, five wide. In still another, it will have swallowed a Lalafell whole, in yet another, it will have swallowed a whole lot of Lalafells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gobbie Mask

This strange floating octopus appears to have abandoned the dangers of the Deep for the freedom of the firmament. When turned on its side, it bears a striking resemblance to a goblin's mask, begging the question, “Which came first? The gobbie mask or <Emphasis>the</Emphasis> gobbie mask?”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Medusa

Its name taken from the serpent-haired seductress of ancient legend, the blue medusa is an anemone-like creature which survives on the underbellies of Abalathia's floating islets. Its tentacles are covered in poisonous barbs which petrify prey, making it easier to seize, devour, and digest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cindersmith

The metallic scales covering this lava-dwelling snail closely resemble those of the deep-sea snail known as the armorer, leading naturalists to hypothesize that at one time, sea levels were much higher, and that when the waters receded, snails left atop mountains began evolving separately.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bullwhip

The violent flagellating motion of this snakelike creature's tail is most likely a means to detect nearby obstacles, as its eyes have regressed into naught more than skin-covered pits on the sides of its head.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiny Axolotl

Naturalists who have had the opportunity to examine the rare samples brought back from Azys Lla have come to the tentative conclusion that despite being several times smaller, a completely different color, and bearing strange whisker-like fins, this amphibious creature is most likely a distant relative to the axolotls that reside in lower Eorzea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
High Allagan Helmet

Writings extracted from recently discovered tomestones state that this particular breed of helmet crab was biologically altered by Allagans to produce an impenetrable shell that could be harvested for armor production.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Platinum Fish

Believed to be a cousin of the goldfish, the platinum fish has fully adapted to life in the corrupted waters of Azys Lla's aetherochemical pools and now requires the aetherially charged liquid to survive. The dazzling sheen of its scales does not appear to be hereditary, however, and rather a result of an aetherochemical reaction caused by the pools.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aether Eye

Due to its lack of eyes, it was once thought this fish hunted like a bat, using sound to navigate the pools in which it lives. However, the popular theory amongst naturalists now is that it instead utilizes a strange organ on its head to detect concentrations of aether.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Azysfish

A fish so filled with poison that it will seep from the wavekin's body, fouling the waters in which it swims. The Azysfish will feed on the corpses of those creatures who fall victim to the deadly venom.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystalfin

Unlike glass perch which all have transparent appendages, fin transparency of crystalfins varies depending on the type of aether concentrated within the fish. Diet, habitat, even weather can change the outward appearance of crystalfins, which is why for so long it was believed that there were as many as six different species.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweetfish

Why the Sharlayan called the sweetfish by that name is unknown, as the fish is in no way sweet, whether eaten raw or cooked. They are, however, delicious─a trait that has resulted in overfishing. Large fish introduced into Dravanian waters by goblins have also contributed to the dwindling population of sweetfish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Orn Butterfly

Native to the lakes of the Orn Wild, the Sharlayans brought scores of the billowy-finned wavekin down from the north to populate their ornamental fountains. When the Sharlayans returned to their homeland, most were left to die...but nature had other plans.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hundred Fin

A circular mane consisting of several tiny fins sprouts from the head of this rare wavekin. For reasons known only to themselves, moogles detest the hundred fin, believing it to be an augur of death, destruction, and mayhem of the most unplayful variety.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Autumn Leaf

This fish uses its uncanny resemblance to a reddened leaf to hide amongst fallen detritus and wait for unsuspecting prey to approach. As this hunting technique is only effective for a two-moon period of the twelvemoon, the wavekin will gorge itself while it can, and then lie dormant until the next autumn calls.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Manasail

Manasails achieve flight by spreading their elastic fins like sails of a ship to gather wind-aspected aether from the clouds. Most spend their lives atop thermals rising high above floating islets of Abalathia and Dravania, and are rarely seen by even the denizens of those skyey regions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sky Sweeper

Sky sweepers are one of the few creatures living in the Sea of Clouds that do not actually have the capability of flight. These sharklike beings are spawned on the backs of larger flying fish, where they spend their entire lives feeding on vilekin and sloughed-off skin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magma Louse

As does its cousin the aetherlouse, the magma louse also feeds on minute traces of aether bled from wounds in Hydaelyn's crust, the most common aspects being fire and earth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cometoise

While it is rumored this tortoise's shell is so hard that it can withstand the impact of a comet, the wavekin's name is derived from the creature's natural tendency to remain motionless for up to several moons to conserve energy when forage is scarce.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aetherochemical Compound #123

Unlike anything else on Eorzea, compound #123 is thought to be another of the Allagan Empire's failed chimerical creations. The creature seems to be harmless enough, feeding only on the tiny water lice which inhabit Azys Lla's aetherochemical pools. Its outer hide, however, has given many a naturalist pause as it bears a texture almost identical to that of a Lalafell's skin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brown Bolo

For most of the sun's turn, the brown bolo will hang stationary from the bottoms of the Churning Mists' floating landmasses. When prey flies or floats by, however, the bolo will throw itself from the crags and wrap around the unsuspecting victim, choking it into submission before propelling itself back to the crag face to feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Philosopher's Stone

This pink-shelled mollusk earned its playful moniker when a group of alchemy students attending one of Sharlayan's academies submitted several of the wavekin for their graduation projects after spending several moons drinking and whoring on Ul'dah's Pearl Lane.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fountfish

Massive lungs and a siphon-like mouth combine to create a powerful jet that the fountfish can use to propel pressurized water at targets on land or in the air. While the water cannot penetrate deep enough to kill an animal, it will breach the skin, causing a target to bleed. It is this blood upon which the fountfish survives.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Weston Bowfin

Despite the abundance of other, easier-to-land wavekin in Dravanian waters, Weston bowfin are actively sought by moogle anglers─not for the fish themselves, but for the bright-red eggs which remind the moogles of their pom-poms.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Letter Puffer

Legend states that letter puffers were once so abundant in the skies above Dravania that clouds of the creatures would blot out the sun. Rampant hunting to collect the volatile gas contained within their bellies drove the puffers to near extinction, and only recently have their numbers begun to grow.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Star Faerie

The only method currently known of distinguishing between a star and a sky faerie is by observing the color of their abdomens. Claims that the star faerie has the flavor of rolanberries have been attributed to a psychological phenomenon that compels individuals to think that something red will taste like something similarly colored.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloaming Coral

Another colored variety of cloud coral found growing on the floating islands above Eorzea, gloaming coral's deep red is a favorite of moogle artists who grind the creature's exoskeleton into a red pigment that can be used in painting rocks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Albino Octopus

These freshwater octopodes feed mainly on the shellfish residing on the beds of glacial lakes. However, when food is scarce, they will leave the water to dig for clams on the frozen shores. This, unfortunately, makes them easy targets for yetis who will dash the octopodes on rocks and then swallow them whole.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragon's Soul

Sight of this dragon-like creature has sent many an alarum ringing, watch-moogles mistaking them for Horde scouts...which normally would be unthinkable, as dragon's souls average only a few ilms in length.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tornado Shark

It has recently been suggested that many of Eorzea's sudden and unexplained wind-aspected aetherial disturbances are not natural occurrences, but actually flying sharks with the capacity of manipulating aether. Enough said.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Warballoon

This jellyfish's striking resemblance to an Ixali war balloon suggests that inspiration for the beast tribe's dirigibles came upon witnessing the wavekin floating hither and thither about the heavens.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fossiltongue

In order to survive the extreme temperatures that would render a normal fish to cinders, the fossiltongue has developed a thick layer of stone scales that cover the wavekin's entire body, including its eyes. To locate its prey, it swims with its fossil-like tongue jut out constantly before it, taking in anything it touches, regardless of whether it is edible or not.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Proto-hropken

A strange fish that bears an eerie resemblance to the sea-dwelling hropken. Judging from the extensive cloning experiments conducted by the Allagans during their Third Astral Era reign, it is entirely feasible that hropkens were an Allagan creation and that this fish represents one of the ungodly stages of hropken development.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Caiman

This snap-jawed scalekin sits atop of the aquatic food chain, feeding on whatever (or whomever!?) crosses his path. The caiman fears no retribution, for there is none who might topple him from his lofty throne. None, that is, of course, except dragons, for even a king must learn to bow his head to the gods.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Euphotic Pirarucu

A variety of pirarucu specially bred by the Allagans for mass consumption. Characteristics include a natural tendency to remain near the water's surface (to allow for quick retrieval), heightened reproductivity, rapid maturation, nutrient-rich flesh, and an easily removable skeleton (for efficient deboning).


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Illuminati Perch

Selective breeding by the goblin scholars known as the Illuminati has created a new variety of perch so foul smelling that only someone wearing a specially crafted gas mask (conveniently such as a gobbie mask) might withstand the noxious vapors long enough to enjoy the rich, buttery flesh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rudderfish

Blindingly fast and possessing almost inexhaustible stamina, the rudderfish is a favorite tool for mother dragons teaching their pups to hunt in the air.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bomb Puffer

Floating like mines in the skies above Azys Lla, bomb puffers will literally explode when set upon by predators, sacrificing their lives to impale their assailants with countless deadly spines. However, the sacrifice is not without purpose. Within those spines are scores of tiny eggs which hatch within the body of the poisoned corpse, and feed on its flesh until old enough to emerge and fly away.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mucous Minnow

Unlike the case with other fish living in Azys Lla's aetherochemical sludge, the mucous minnow will perish if exposed to the liquid for even a short period of time. Luckily for this wavekin, it is born covered in a viscous transparent barrier which not only protects the minnow, but also acts as a filter, allowing the wavekin to absorb waterborne algae.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Flying Biomass

Also known as a UFB, the numerous attempts to identify this hovering clam have all been unsuccessful, the worst case resulting in a septuagenarian scholar falling several thousand yalms from a floating islet onto a highland haycock. Most of the hay was salvaged from the accident. The scholar was not.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hospitalier Fish

Found only in warm waters, this tiny fish feeds mainly on algae and other aquatic flora. In extreme cases, however, the wavekin will eat the dead skin off of animals wading in their habitat. Ishgardian chirurgeons have been known to use this survival trait to their advantage, applying the fish to festering wounds so that they may devour the corrupted flesh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scorpionfly

The scorpionfly exhibits the peculiar habit of flying its prey to an islet different from the one upon which it subdues its meal. Naturalists guess that this may be done to keep future prey unaware of the threat the scorpionfly poses, making it easier to return to the islet at a later date and hunt with relative ease.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rockclimber

The rockclimber uses a suction cup on its underbelly to climb up rocks. Once in position, it will wait until an insect flies by, and then leap into the air, catch the morsel in its mouth and land safely back in the water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Skipper

Blood skippers will use a set of highly developed pelvic fins to periodically “walk” forth from their pools in search of new homes. Such a journey from the water's protective depths would normally leave a creature exposed to land-dwelling predators. Fortunately for the blood skipper, the extreme toxicity of its flesh discourages all but the most hungry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cobrafish

Measuring up to several yalms long, the cobrafish's dorsal fin is covered in thousands of hair-like feelers which are thought to absorb airborne concentrations of wind-aspected aether. The collected energy is then distributed evenly throughout the body to create a temporary state of weightlessness which enables flight via the “flapping” of the pectoral and pelvic fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moogle Spirit

So silent are these cousins of the flying manta, that the Vanu Vanu believe them to be the embodied spirits of the legendary moogles who, many generations past, once flourished in the Sea of Clouds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oil Eel

When assaulted by a predator, the oil eel will release copious amounts of a slick, mucus-like substance that prevents adequate purchase, allowing the wavekin to escape. Despite what the name suggests, the secreted substance does not actually contain any oil.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeweled Jellyfish

Strictly a nocturnal hunter, this luminescent jellyfish uses the colorful light emitted by its body to lure insects and small fish into its inescapable web of poisonous tentacles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Galley

With fins like billowing sails and a mouth like an armored ramming prow, this large freshwater fish not only has the appearance of a Lominsan battle galley, but also the strength─repeatedly butting larger prey until stunned and susceptible to attack.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yalm Lobster

From claw to tail, the length of this freshwater crustacean often exceeds a full yalm when fully grown. While not as succulent as the meat from smaller lobsters, a single tail can feed a Lalafellin family of seven or a single Roegadyn adolescent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hinterlands Perch

A ferociously territorial fish, the hinterlands perch currently finds itself in a heated battle with several goblin-introduced foreign species over dominion of the waters of lower Dravania.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oven Catfish

An ancient tome on culinary legend kept on display at the Bismarck tells the story of a man who climbed the highest peak in Abalathia's Spine to catch the mythical catfish which swim the red-hot blood of Hydaelyn Herself. Upon drawing the fish from the lake of lava, he found the fish was already cooked, and proceeded to devour it, for the journey into the heart of the mountain had left him famished.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pteranodon

If sketches in ancient bestiaries are to be believed, this scalekin has changed very little over the past several millennia, leading some to believe that it is of the same blood as the dragons. This has, however, been disproven, the flying lizards possessing about as much intelligence as the average ninki nanka.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Winged Gurnard

The wings of this flying fish are almost completely made up of concentrated aether─aether that dissipates once the fish has been caught, leaving naught but a skeletal frame.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Urchin

Though found solely in the hyperborean reaches of Eorzea, the spring urchin can only survive in the heated waters of geothermal springs. A good number of the shrill howls that fill the Coerthan nights are from yetis who mistakenly step on the urchins' spiked shells when wading through the natural baths.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cherry Trout

Contrary to popular belief, the cherry trout is actually named after the pinkish red hue of its underbelly. And so doth continue mankind's never-ending search for a cherry-flavored fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stupendemys

This rare tortoise's ability of flight is granted by its fabulous shell made up of solid wind crystal. As long as the shell remains undamaged, the cloudkin will remain aloft; however, the moment even the smallest of scratches are suffered, it will plummet back to Hydaelyn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Magefish

Similar to how the sorcerer fish is able to manipulate its body's fire-aspected aether, the black magefish is able to tap into the ice-aspected aether contained in its phlegmatic humours to perpetually cool its body, allowing it to survive in otherwise deadly molten lava.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Barreleye

The braincase of this dome-headed fish is, unlike the rest of its body, completely transparent and filled with a gel-like substance in which the eyes float. The lack of any even remotely similar creatures in all of the Three Great Continents suggests that this creature may be another one of the Allagan Empire's terrible creations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunderbolt Eel

While able to generate an electric charge with its body, this wavekin does not utilize that charge to subdue its prey, but rather locate it by detecting how the electric waves change after being released. Once the eel has determined where its prey is, it will wrap itself about the creature and strangle it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Catkiller

The catkiller is a freshwater pike which uses its long, whip-like dorsal fin to impale gaelicats who fly too close to the water's surface. Formerly called a “gaelicatkiller,” the amalgamation of three different words into one was deemed by naturalist circles far too difficult to read and subsequently shortened to its current (albeit equally unceremonious) moniker.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Loosetongue

This colossal wavekin is, in fact, little more than a common bonytongue that has grown to an enormous size in the relatively safe waters of the Dravanian hinterlands. This phenomenon, however, has allowed scholars to form a correlation between the size of a bonytongue and the softness of its tongue.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thaliak Caiman

Whereas most of the known world shies away from the fetid odor emitted by Illuminati perch, the Thaliak caiman seems drawn to it, refusing to eat any other manner of flesh if a perch is detected in the vicinity. This eating habit has made the scalekin a target of Illuminati fishers, who will employ heavy crossbows in an attempt to protect the fish (that they eventually plan on catching and eating themselves).


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavalord

Even with several live specimens having been caught and returned to Ul'dah for further study, many naturalists still deny the existence of magma-dwelling fish such as the lavalord, and dismiss the finding of their peers as lies concocted to gain fame.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tupuxuara

All existing samples of the tupuxuara─an ancient breed of wyvern─have been discovered in the Aetherochemical Research Facility on Azys Lla. If these were indeed created in the Allagan Empire's laboratories, it would make the creatures several thousand years old.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vampiric Tapestry

Despite the fear-inducing moniker, this flying cephalopod neither sups on blood nor transforms into a bat. Rumors that it does not cast a shadow are unfounded, and all manner of stakes, from oak, to iron, to granite, to cermet, have been found effective in impaling this rather peaceful creature of the clouds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Storm Chaser

Inside the storm chaser's belly lives a unique type of yeast which breaks down food to create a lighter-than-air gas which allows the fish to float. Short bursts of this gas from its rectum are used for propulsion. Yes, you read that correctly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Berserker Betta

Sharlayan scholars deemed the berserker betta to be one of the most violent breeds of the already infamously violent family of betta. Despite having little to no chance of subduing a target, berserker betta will repeatedly attack fish three to four times larger than itself. This natural-born stubbornness has ensured the berserker population remains relatively small.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Capelin

During spawning season, a female capelin's belly will be so full of eggs that the fish will almost double in size, making the wavekin a favorite amongst egg-loving Qiqirn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Functional Proto-hropken

Markedly more developed than the proto-hropken, the slightest hint of intelligence can be sensed when staring into this abomination's eyes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coerthan Clione

Oft found thriving beneath the surface of the permanently frozen lakes of northern Coerthas, these shell-less mollusks wield a half-dozen scourge-like tentacles to throttle, asphyxiate, and then rend apart their prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dravanian Smelt

Popular prey for dragonflies, who are said to only require a single adult to sate their appetites, this close cousin of the Abalathian smelt is abundant in the slightly warmer waters of the Dravanian forelands.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavens Coral

Scholars of marine life believe that heavens coral is merely blue coral that, after prolonged exposure to high concentrations of wind-aspected aether, have taken on a lighter blue tint.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunsail

During the daylight hours these cousins of the manasail sleep clinging to the undersides of the many islets comprising the Sea of Clouds. When the sun begins to set and the skies bleed orange and red, the sunsails simultaneously take to the cooling skies to feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goblin Bass

Another variety of wavekin introduced to the Thaliak River by goblin fishers, the foreign bass poses a threat to the watershed's native flora and fauna by consuming nearly anything that is not a rock.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lava Snail

In addition to being diamond-hard, the shell of the lava snail can also block nearly all the heat from molten lava. Heat-resistant armor crafted by stringing together thousands of the shells has been known to sell for small fortunes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Amber Salamander

The deep orange patterns on this wavekin's skin are similar to those found on several varieties of highly poisonous mushrooms. This convenient trait helps protect the salamander from hungry predators despite not possessing any toxins in its body...and being quite delicious. The amber salamander, himself, is aware of this fact, and will sometimes resort to cannibalism when other food is scarce. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gnomefish

The gnomefish is a gruesome creature that lives most of its life cowering beneath boulders in still or slow-moving waters so as to avoid being devoured by other larger fish. The tigerfish is one of these predators and will lurk nearby such boulders waiting for the rare occasion on which a gnomefish emerges to feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fleece Stingray

While its ancestors may have been wavekin, subsequent generations' extended exposure to submarine wind crystals has aided the fleece stingray's evolution into its current form. Great flocks (schools?) of the white-bellied rays are sometimes mistaken for swift-moving rain clouds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nyctosaur

The function of the enlarged comb which protrudes from the center of the nyctosaur's head has yet to be determined by the realm's naturalists, with some scholars believing it stores water, much like a dromedary's hump, while other believe it to be a hollow chamber which serves to deepen and amplify mating calls.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Priestfish

The crozier-like bioluminescent proboscis dangling from the priestfish's forehead attracts prey in the murky depths of the pools in which this distant cousin of the monkfish resides.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coerthan Oyster

The shells of these freshwater mollusks are so impenetrable that local fishers have dubbed them “the Fury's shields.” Luckily, prying them from the rocks upon which they live is as simple as sliding a knife beneath their shells and giving a slight pull upwards.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oliphant's Trunk

Similar to an electric eel, the near-blind oliphant's trunk emits low-frequency electrical pulses into surrounding waters in order to better locate its prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mountain Kraken

For centuries, the legend of Saint Daniffen and the Kraken was thought to be only that─a fantastical tale spun by the See to beatify the life of an otherwise kindly, yet ordinary, man. That is, until a giant cephalopod was found lurking in a mountain lake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Armored Catfish

Sharlayan scholars who studied this peculiar variety of catfish at length before returning to their homeland claim that the species is not a wavekin like its cousins, but rather a scalekin that, after many eons residing in water, shed its legs for fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Magic Bucket

There was once a young fisher-cum-sorceress who, cursing the fact she was born with only two hands with which to carry her myriad tackle, called upon the power of unseen spirits to ensorcell a bucket to transport her catch...only to watch it sink to the bottom of a lake when her concentration was broken by a crayfish nipping at her ankles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fat Purse

So plump does this rare Coerthan puffer grow when intimidated, that anglers began playfully comparing the fish to the bursting-with-coin purses oft flaunted by Ishgardian nobles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Impaler

One morning, while on patrol, a knight hailing from Falcon's Nest spied the fallen corpse of a yeti near one of Dragonspit's bubbling pools. Upon further investigation, he determined the cause of death to be a massive urchin spine embedded in the creature's foot. An Ishgardian naturalist who later examined the spine estimated the original urchin at several yalms in diameter...give or take several yalms.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
La Reale

This oversized battle galley with a tendency to stun its prey by ramming it with its sharp, pointed jaw, was named after a legendary steam-powered ship built by the Holy See to patrol the waters of the Bloodbrine Sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scaleripper

Lost between drunken tales of swallowing Lalafells whole and swallowing a whole lot of Lalafells, is a hushed yarn spun in smoky taverns about a shadowhisker with an unnatural appetite for slightly larger prey─dragons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dreamweaver

If the clickings of the Vath braveheart are to be believed, the soul of this elusive warmwater bichir rises each night from the Smoldering Wastes to invade his mind and torment his dreams.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Meteortoise

This mountain-dwelling tortoise will heat its shell until it glows meteor red, then leap from its lava pool, falling back first onto its prey to both slay and cook it in one fell stroke.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ewer King

While the Thaliak River with its majestic waterfall the Tipped Ewer is home to countless creatures large and small, only one has the size, strength, and cunning to be crowned “king.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vidofnir

Incomparable size combined with a decided lack of pigment in this noontide oscar's skin invokes comparisons to the great white dragon, Vidofnir.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Soul of the Martyr

The moogles of Moghome insist that they have witnessed the passing of legendary Ratatoskr's essence into its secondary vessel─the very fish that lies motionless at the bottom of your bag. Let us hope they are mistaken.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Inkfish

Despite the suggestion by its name that this unique bubble eye goldfish has the ability to spit like a squid, the inkfish earns its name from the black patterns on its body thought to resemble the ever-changing whorls created when ink is spilled into water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Second One

As if there was not already “enough said” regarding tornado sharks, sightings of an even larger and more violent example of these freaks of nature have the Rose Knights on edge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Augmented High Allagan Helmet

With a shell even harder than a typical Allagan helmet, this biological aberration feeds by releasing a highly corrosive substance onto rocks, dissolving them into a foul solution which is then slurped back up using the wavekin's straw-like tongue.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aphotic Pirarucu

Unlike euphotic pirarucu which remain near the surface, these wavekin, for some reason, chose to ignore their species' natural attraction to the light and instead remain and feed on the sediment that collects in deep water. The high mineral content of this sediment results in rock-like scales unseen on the aphotic pirarucu's cousins. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hailfinder

Similar to its smaller rime eater cousins, the hailfinder is also known for its appetite for glacier cores. So efficient is the creature at absorbing the extreme cold emitted by its prey, that research was conducted by the Heavens' Ward into determining if they might be used to counter Shiva's subzero sorceries during skirmishes with the primal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flarefish

Believed to be the sole reason the unfrozen pond remains free of ice, in order to partake in the warmth emitted by the flarefish's sanguine humours, other fish will form schools (at a distance), surrounding the specimen in a barrier which effectively provides protection from larger predators.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Twin-tongued Carp

With three lips and two tongues, this rare carp has enough internal and external appendages to render any respectable ichthyologist flummoxed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Madam Butterfly

There is the sad tale of a pair of butterfly fish kept by a Sharlayan sophist. When preparations for the great exodus back to the Old World were being made, the sophist's manservant separated the two fish to prevent scale damage in transit. An error in packing, however, saw one of the fish─the female─left behind. Madam has since lived her life in sadness awaiting her husband's return.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moggle Mogpom

Considerably larger than most mogpoms, the moggle mogpom is believed not only to be the discarded pom of a fallen comrade, but <Emphasis>the</Emphasis> pom of legendary Moghome chieftain, Moggle Mog.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cirrostratus

Named for the thin summertime clouds it resembles, the cirrostratus is believed to achieve flight despite its enormous size due to its parchment-like membranous “wings.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hraesvelgr's Tear

The pristine glass shell encompassing this remarkable magma-dwelling creature is regarded amongst vivarists as to be the Twelve's most beautiful creation, and therefore is highly sought within collectors' circles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aetherochemical Compound #666

When a specimen of what, at the time, was thought to be compound #123 began sprouting tiny...decidedly <Emphasis>Lalafellin</Emphasis>...hands, no fewer than three Sons of Saint Coinach naturalists turned in their resignations with the organization and have since disappeared from the public eye.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hundred-eyed Axolotl

A rare mutation of the tiny axolotl, the countless spots covering this peculiar wavekin's moist skin serve as a defense mechanism, frightening would-be predators into thinking they are being watched by a hundred eyes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bobgoblin Bass

The one fish that has long eluded renowned Illuminati angler Quickthinx Allthoughts, the bobgoblin bass earns its name from the queer bobbing motion it oft employs to, in Quickthinx's words, “taunt his would-be pursuers.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Merciless

After a three-bell ale-fueled diatribe regarding one man's futile quest to capture the elusive Merciless─a mercy staff fattened to epic proportions─the proprietor of the tavern in which the forlorn fisher oft frequented closed the man's tab, telling him, “let it all go.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dimorphodon

Do not be fooled by its size. The dimorphodon may be five to seven times smaller than its wyvern cousins, but its temperament is twice as foul, and its appetite four times as large.*

*All values listed here have no basis in scientific fact.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Basking Shark

The massive maw of this rarely seen colossus of the clouds is thought to serve two distinct purposes─one, to devour entire coveys of prey in a single gulp, and two, to dramatically increase air resistance allowing for near instant aerial stops and turns.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Allagan Bladeshark

Military documents retrieved from Azys Lla reveal that the bladeshark is a chimerical monstrosity created to serve as a biological weapon. The rapid vibrations exhibited in the creature's unnaturally elongated mouth is a trait artificially induced by scientists to increase the tearing power of its razor-sharp teeth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bishopfish

The divine radiance emitted by the bishopfish's cranial proboscis is like to dazzle many a smaller fry into literally “giving its life” for the cloth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Captain Nemo

Named after a legendary inventor and sea captain who claimed to have traveled to the bottom of the Indigo Deep in a watertight galley hull, this overgrown ammonite uses aether-charged tentacles to deftly slice prey into pieces small enough to fit in its surprisingly tiny mouth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Paikiller

Already in shock from the discovery of a freshwater pike that consumes gaelicats, the scientific community was far from prepared for the subsequent discovery of a pike that prefers paissa. As was the case with the “catkiller,” naturalists insisted on keeping the name as short as possible, and thus settled on “paikiller,” despite complaints that it too closely resembled the word “painkiller.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ceti

Modern naturalist circles were positively abuzz following the discovery of an Allagan tomestone which contained an article on an oliphant's trunk with a maw so sensitive, that it was believed the wavekin could detect activity in the very heavens. Further study of the work however led to the conclusion that the piece was satire.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystal Pigeon

While much of the information gathered from the Habisphere's talkative nodes is limited to occupancy numbers and repair reports, one audio record concerning an elite marksmen's club's afternoon of sniping genetically enhanced stupendemys for sport gives us a rare glimpse into Allagan everyday life.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunderscale

Having no other explanation as to why this lone amber salamander would exhibit the ability to emit electric shocks from its skin, the fisher who first discovered this unique wavekin simply assumed that it was because it fed upon the shed scales of a thunder dragon. As of this writing, no one has been able to confirm or deny her claim.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Riddle

While the riddle from which this aged magma louse earns its name is far from what anyone would deem clever─“what lives in molten rock, yet moves less than a corpse?”─it is fairly accurate in describing the vilekin's two main characteristics.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lord of Lords

Those naturalists who have placed aside their doubts and come to accept the existence of the fantastical magma-dwelling lavalords have, in their research, discovered the wavekin possess a violent “lord-eat-lord” societal hierarchy, and that rampant cannibalism appears to be the reason only a single male is ever found in a lava pool.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Speaker

The first fisher to supposedly ever have caught the Speaker claims that upon drawing it into his net, the wavekin spoke to him in an oddly ranine voice─pleading to release him back into the waters that he may return to his loving wife and spawn. Thinking it some sort of sign from the Twelve, the fisher did as he was told, only to be rewarded with a croaking cackle and a slap of water in his face.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thousand Fin

While “one thousand” may be a gross overstatement regarding the number of tiny fins that circle this queer wavekin's head, for the moogles who are known to utterly despise the hundred fin, achieving numerical accuracy is not a high priority in the event one is encountered in the wild.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloodchaser

This peculiar storm chaser exhibits fins that are a deep crimson, hence the colorful name. Despite local Vanu Vanu legend which claims the contrary, Bloodchaser does not appear to drain the humours of its victims, but feeds just as any other storm chaser─digesting prey in its stomach to produce gas that it emits from its rectum to achieve propulsion. Yes, you read that correctly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Problematicus

When this particular specimen was presented at a naturalist symposium for classification, the day ended in a flurry of fisticuffs following a heated argument over whether it was not merely a fake stitched together in a cluttered study. The following day the claims were voted baseless and the wavekin received its new official name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Opabinia

One can only imagine the manner of twisted carnal desires which drove the Allagan bioengineer who created this five-eyed, tentacled monstrosity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Armor Fish

Many graduates of new Sharlayan's universities look back on their education with great fondness, reminiscing of days past with tales of studying for exams into the small hours, their rooms lit with naught but the faint glow emitted by armor fish caught in the Thaliak River.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Butterfly

Lighter than the seed of a dandelion, the sea butterfly flitters about the Sea of Clouds searching for the tiny midges upon which it feeds. So rare are these mollusks that seeing one is widely believed to bring good fortune.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Charibenet

After witnessing the voracity with which it devoured its kin, it almost seemed wrong <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to name this gluttonous ice faerie after the Holy See's infamous First Inquisitor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raimdellopterus

Also known as the “king of the wyverns,” the raimdellopterus was given its official name in honor of the bicentennial of Frandelont Raimdelle's masterwork, the Raimdelle Codex.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thavnairian Leaf

The colorful patterns which cover the Thavnairian leaf's body make it a popular addition to aquariums. Once almost impossible to acquire on mainland Eorzea, the Near Eastern native's recent introduction to the Thaliak River has seen its asking price drop from “wholly ludicrous” to “somewhat absurd.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ghost Faerie

In contrast to ice faeries which, while possessing transparent bodies, still display coloring in their internal organs, ghost faeries are entirely without pigment, making them almost impossible to see in the pristine waters of their natural habitat─Clearpool.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Sky Coral

Similar in almost every way to the red coral found in Eorzea's five seas, scholars remain perplexed at just how this particular breed of immobile wavekin came to live in the Sea of Clouds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lovers' Clam

A popular game amongst Eorzean children consists of putting separate halves of lovers' clam shells in two sacks, and having boys draw from one, and girls from the other. The participants then look to see who has the other half of their shell, the resulting pairs being an augury of true love.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
River Shrimp

When asked which decapod crustacean was their favorite supper treat, nine out of ten orphans claimed they preferred freshwater river shrimp to ordinary saltwater shrimp. All nine claimed one was never enough, and that they would always ask for seconds, to which the reply was consistently, “MORE!? YOU WANT MORE!?”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Comet Minnow

Stargazers tell of a deity's long descent through the night sky to shine amid murky waters, and claim the fires of the heavens still burn upon its scales. Aquaculturists generally espouse cynicism toward such out-of-this-world origin stories.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Cichlid

Cichlids named for the glittering scales unique to adult males, which garner the attention of mates and predators alike. The survival of the species undoubtedly owes more to the subdued, aptly camouflaging blue hue featured by its widows and orphans.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abalathian Bitterling

The bitterling's lack of pigmentation is not the result of mutation or albinism, but rather the product of natural selection, as only the fairest among them were able to blend into the riverbed gravel and avoid predation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Idle Goby

One would have to wake up pretty early in the morning to out-slack this notoriously lackadaisical loiterer. Its primary hunting technique consists of lying stagnant in the Slow Wash and waiting for its prey to drift up to it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Steelhead Trout

Life carries this fish back-and-forth, swimming down to estuaries when reaching age, then back upstream to spawn, lending its name to widespread, on-the-nose “seasonal rebirth” clichés in Hingan literature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Broken Crab

Possessed of a shell no living creature could crack, the crab's hubris grew so great as to warrant the notice of Rhalgr, who by His very hand split its shell asunder for eternity, or so it is said.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Miounnefish

Pipira, indigenous to the Black Shroud, were successfully transplanted into the climes of Gyr Abania, where they bear the name of the guildmaster largely responsible for their change of address.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Temple Carp

Long ago, disciples of the Fist were made to catch these fish by hand as part of their training regimen. The fish remain a testament to the preparedness of the Fist, now loosed in nearby waters to serve as a bulwark against starvation in the case of a siege.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Balloon Frog

Named for the cheek-puffing posture it manifests when threatened, which can be seen as either intimidating or adorable, depending on your position in the food chain. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lantern Marimo

Many a monk has reached enlightenment meditating before the faint aura emitted by this illuminating breed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rapids Jumper

This species often fails to live up to the fanfare inferred from its fast-paced, go-against-the-flow name, as the only flow it has to go against is the Slow Wash.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Adamantite Bichir

Clad in hard, interlocking links that resemble a suit of mail more than they do scales, this fish is known to leave a trail of broken muud suud teeth in its wake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bone Melter

Necrophagous whelk that flocks to carcasses en masse, whittling them down to next to nothing. Morbid feeding habits aside, it does have a pretty shell, which hunters carry around for luck.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fallen Leaf

If a tree falls in the woods, and there is no one there to see it, do the leaves that fall in water become possessed by migrant spirits and generate a new species of fish?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Velodyna Grass Carp

Midsized, yet critical, link in the food chain of the river valley from which it borrows its name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Highland Perch

If you ever wish to see two natural historians at each other's throats, try asking them what the difference between a hinterlands perch and a highland perch is. Wars have been waged over less hotly contested disputes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Greenstream Loach

There's no prying this intractable flatfish loose once it deploys its ventral fin for suction, and its aptitude for withstanding the most violent of currents has rendered its name synonymous with obstinacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mirage Chub

Some might pass this silver fish off as commonplace at first glance, but when the season is right and she dons her ravishing red sash, you can bet they'll take notice. When ready to breed, her unique scale pattern generates a stunning visual effect meant to mesmerize mates and other admirers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Padjali Loach

Its strict algae diet keeps this fish in pristine health, giving it a fresh, delectable flavor that fetches top gil with Gyr Abanian fishmongers and renders it a worthy tribute to the Padjal. This demonstrates that contrary to common perception, a life of healthy eating is not always in a species' best interests.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gyr Abanian Trout

Anyone who's ever been to Gyr Abania is likely to have seen one, and even more likely to have eaten one, as this particular trout is deemed a local specialty. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloodsipper

The popular misconception that this sanguine crustacean slices mammals with its claws and partakes of their blood is patently false, but believable enough to have inspired its moniker.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Monk Betta

Exhibiting an austere warrior spirit and fierce territorial aggression, violence among fellow fish of the order is often marked by vicious brutality.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gilfish

Glamorous per its name, one glint of this fish's ostentatious scales is often enough to invite avaricious wish-chasers to a watery grave.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Falling Star

Denomination for a faintly luminescent subset of algae, their phosphorescent fires allegedly lit long ago by the burning star cast forth by Rhalgr.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Capsized Squeaker

Having the unusual habit of swimming upside down in common suggests some relation between this squeaker and its Dravanian cousin, although the precise distance of said relation is yet to be established.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nirvana Crab

It is said an underachieving monk achieved enlightenment in a single night. On inspecting his bedchambers, the assembled throng of disciples received the wordless sermon of this crab holding up a white mushroom.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gravel Gudgeon

Succulent fish whose only refuge from the talons of griffins lies nestled under the riverbed. Seldom, if ever, has one been spotted with scales intact.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Grinning Anchovy

This fowl-mouthed forage fish often plumbs the depths of Hingan cauldrons, its juices boiled out to form the base of beloved broths.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glass Herring

This migratory fish thrives under transparency, unlike its misleading red cousins. Its brine-pickled eggs foreshadow deliciousness.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hellyfish

Tormented soul that has ventured from the bowels of the underworld through a hellmouth to claim the lives of mortals with its virulent venom. Petting not recommended.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Coral

More commonly known as “Reef Ruby” or “Peasant Ruby,” you'll find no shortage of this ostensible gemstone polished and set in the trinkets of Hingan traders.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sapphire Coral

Luckily for the survival of the species, this sapphiric simulant has failed to come in vogue with the Hingan fashion-conscious as has its equally alluring ruby cousin. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bone Coral

Virtually indistinguishable from mammalian bones, this coral can cause quite a commotion upon washing ashore, and often engenders a sense of foreboding in sailors of the East.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Shrimp

For all their differences, the people of Othard and Hingashi have always had one thing in common, as these zesty and succulent prawns are loved on all sides of the Ruby Sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coeurl Snake Eel

For decades, the taxonomy of this species had been the subject of fierce tripartite debate, driving the aquatic nomenclature community to the brink of schism, until a compromise was reached whereby the creature would simply be known by all three names.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heather Charr

The social struggle for dominance this species encounters in schools is often on display at the base of the waterfall, which the fish treat as a sort of cafeteria. When a water-struck insect falls before them, the fish move quickly to judge it, as if asking “what's your damage?” before descending upon it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Electric Catfish

The unenlightened claim that Rhalgr bestowed the divine might of thunder upon this catfish in recognition of its zealous devotion, but aquariophiles dismiss these silly claims, knowing the breed to be terribly irreverent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Death Loach

This fish gives new meaning to “the sweet kiss of death,” as wars have been waged over its delectable flesh, hence its fateful name. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Grymm Crab

A tragic crab named for a man who nearly perished of thirst while fleeing the floods of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, only to eventually drown guzzling the first fresh water he stumbled upon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Invisible Crayfish

This crawdad is best known to Gyr Abanians via the faerie tale in which its brilliant shell fades with each cycle of the Slow Wash, until only an empty white palette remains.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abalathian Salamander

Wavekin that plays the runt among its kith. Its rubbery flesh results in an unappetizing texture when cooked, rendering it for all practical purposes inedible.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cave Killifish

Rugged little fry with the wherewithal to thrive in even the dankest, darkest subterranean climes, though it is unclear how they ever got there in the first place.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhalgr's Bolt

When this electric eel shocks and awes its prey like a god of thunder, the victim rocks and rolls, and the spell it's under slowly robs it of its soul.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Butterfly Fish

Though indigenous to southern waters, now and again a papilliferous wanderer will lose its way and flutter mindlessly into the Ruby Sea. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dafu

From an ancient Far Eastern term for “genius” or “master of its trade,” its name speaks to the inspiring artistry on display in this magnificent specimen.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaf Tatsunoko

An eccentric protrusion enables this seafarer to evade predators by posing as algae, which it also relies on for cloaking its eggs. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glass Flounder

Flat sheet of a fish that pairs wonderfully with grog when properly stewed. Makes an easier-to-chew entrée than its name might imply.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gliding Fish

Per its name, this nautical drifter skitters gracefully along the water's surface on the lift of its aliform fins, though its hurried scurrying to escape predators occasionally lands it smack onto a fishing boat floor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Globefish

When faced with immediate danger, this fish pulls its best bombfish impression, puffing up its proportions and projecting spines to dissuade would-be diners from digging in.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fan Clam

Though it maintains an avid following in Isari, the “fan” of this bivalve mollusk's name actually refers to the flabelliform shape of its exoskeleton, as any reasonable person would naturally conclude.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Striped Fugu

Beyond the potentially fatal toxins of its liver and ovaries lies a flavor to die for, as survivors will attest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Meagre

Don't let the name fool you; this shoal-dweller is anything but meager when it comes to flavor. Delicious any way you slice or cook it, Isari anglers are always on the lookout for what ultimately constitutes a staple of their diet.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
River Barramundi

Despite its name, phylogeny suggests that this fish is actually more carp than barramundi, though the herons and other avians that feed off of it don't seem to mind.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nogoi

Yanxia has found itself overrun by this species with a formulaic overpopulating blend of longevity and hyperactive libido. The “no” of its name aptly deriving from the Hingan for “wild.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pagan Pirarucu

An unorthodox variety of catfish upon which Rhalgr did not see fit to bestow His gift of thunder, hence it has little more than its biting wit with which to fend for itself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Enid Shrimp

Shrimp bearing the name of a woman who perished with her husband Grymm while fleeing the floods of the Sixth Umbral Calamity. It is said she died of drinking too much water while trying to slake an unquenchable thirst.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Velodyna Carp

The rivers of Velodyna and Hathoeva are rife with these hungry natators, whose ebon exterior derives from a dark diet. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yanxian Koi

The One River is flooded with this species, which is surprisingly nutritious if you can look past its muddy stink and abundance of small sharp bones. Locals are wont to drench it in liquor and sugar and let soak until palatable.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Longhair Catfish

Meandering purposefully along the bed of the One River, this fish's signature whiskers exude an air of solitary sagacity befitting its unofficial “hermitfish” appellation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doman Trout

Run-of-the-mill trout found far and wide across Yanxia. Whoever said cats won't touch them has never owned a Doman cat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yanxian Barramundi

Tall tales abound around the One River, but have you heard the one about the fish bigger than a full-grown Hyur? The ecstasy of reeling in the fabled monster is soon offset by the realization one must then haul it all the way back home.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Killifish

These lovable little lads are a regular attraction at the fairs of the Far East. Eager younglings line up to test their skill and take one home, whereupon the fish are free to ravage local fish populations with plague and make good on their name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doman Crayfish

Head to a countryside creek in Yanxia on a warm summer's day and you'll be sure to see children fishing out these crustacean critters, which are as common as they are harmless.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Othardian Trout

A familiar face anywhere you journey on the subcontinent, its ubiquity has led to innumerable interpretations of a multitude of dishes all across Othard. Indeed nowhere is safe for this fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zagas Khaal

Ask a nomad of the Azim Steppe to blurt out the first fish that comes to mind, and without fail you will hear the name of this pervasive species, followed by an awkward silence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Steppe Skipper

This fish's aerodynamic green fins allow it to jump to conclusions rather than go through the motions. The Auri Xaela, who know a thing or two about shortcuts, regard the steppe skipper as a portent of good things to come.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Bass

Azim in the sky is said to partake of this fish fit for a god, though you'll want to think twice before partaking yourself, as the parasites that riddle its body have proven potentially fatal to less-than-divine diners.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Crayfish

Devoted disciple of the Dawn Father who battles his sworn enemy for control of the Azim Steppe, and rises as his rival sets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nhaama's Boon

A fish held in the highest esteem by desert denizens, who deem it a gift from the Dusk Mother herself. It's edible, but far from transcendent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doman Eel

A stable source of sustenance through times both thick and thin, these eels have had a profound impact on the culinary culture of Doma, but attempts to farm them have thus far met with failure.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brassfish

Sharing color with the metal alloy of its name, this fish has been chromatically cultivated to achieve a variety of metallic hues, resulting in warehouse-worths of industrial fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dry Steppe Skipper

Unlike its purportedly “lucky” brethren, encountering this withering-grass-colored variety of steppe skipper is regarded as an omen of ill fortune among nomads. Dry humor is often lost on the superstitious.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Skytear

This fish receives its melancholy moniker from the Xaela, its azure hue conjuring the lachrymose image of a heavenly drop into a pool of sorrow.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jade Sculpin

This celadon swimmer sports a semi-precious shade of green more befitting an amphibian.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardscale

Coated with manifold sheets of interlocking polyfibrous scales capable of deflecting high-velocity harpoons, this is a fish that lives up to its name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doman Grass Carp

Were it not for the work of these diligent custodians, the One River would be awash in waterweeds. Day in and day out, these unsung heroes dutifully embark upon the thankless task of maintaining their ecosystem by devouring mass quantities of unsavory aquatic grass.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Samurai Fish

Glaring across a battlefield of blue, the purple-belted combatant hovers unflinching, unyielding about his territory. His stoic features betray no emotion, his mind remains clear as the limpid sea, ready and unhesitant to render his life to defend his honor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tao Bitterling

Though the breed is generally deemed unfit for consumption, the Mol nevertheless persist in fishing for them per the bidding of their holy men; a case of faith operating contrary to nature's plan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blank Oscar

The finest papermakers of Doma have yet to create a sheet so blindingly white as this species, which has become a symbol of purity customarily present as good luck at local weddings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragonfish

Though oft found in the aquariums of well-to-do merchants who fancy themselves the living incarnations of imperious, fire-breathing serpents, any relationship between this fish and the mystical creature of legend is purely metaphorical.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lordly Salmon

A favorite of Ganen, the first Doman king. Per the local jus primae piscis practice, the first-caught fish of each season would be the lord's to dine on that night.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yellow Prismfish

Scales that absorb a citrine pigment in the waters of Prism Lake to glimmer like gold. As for its flavor, one is reminded of the age-old adage “All that glitters isn't food.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Prismfish

Is it a blue carp that came to thrive amid like-colored waters, or a carp that became blue in order to thrive? Whether the trait was inherited or acquired, the distinct azure tint of this species blends perfectly into its native habitat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bull's Bite

According to the old wives' tale, swaddling Raubahn would bite into big beefy bits of this fish, bones and all, before his milk teeth had grown in. According to the man himself, the tale is wildly apocryphal, but the name stuck nevertheless.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Peeping Pisces

The bulging eyes that endow this fish with expanded peripheral vision also give it its voyeuristic moniker and scandalous reputation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gigant Bass

Fish known to grow as long as a boastful Gyr Abanian fisherman's arms can stretch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Daio Squid

Known to Hingans as the “great king,” this rare kraken maintains a shroud of mystery, only surfacing from deep-sea depths when it truly needs a release.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Koromo Octopus

When a ship draws near, this tiny little sucker billows out like the Hingan garment for which it is named, transmogrifying to mammoth proportions before dragging sailors from their decks to the depths, or so an old sailor sings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glass Tuna

With a taste as smooth and crystal clear as its name, one bite of this tuna will have you half-full of optimism.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raitonfish

There's a whale of a tale about a beast of a fish that eluded the grasp of fishers time and again, but couldn't avoid fate when a novice ninja inadvertently cast a Raiton spell down to a random point in the river.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eastern Pike

This eastern relative of the northern pike demonstrates the ranged-attack prowess of an Ala Mhigan pikeman upon his prey, when not himself impaled upon a fisher's spear.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock Saltfish

Pity the poor minotaur who had the ill fortune of treading upon this fish's fatal fin, pricked under-hoof with a potent poison that gradually reduced the colossal creature to a mere carcass.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tawny Wench Shark

To spear this shark with a single harpoon is a Kojin rite of passage, a custom lending itself to easy innuendo and foisting an undeservedly tawdry reputation upon the shark.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zekki Grouper

Prized by Hingans for its myriad culinary uses. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, or sauté it. It's good pan-fried, deep-fried, or stir-fried. There's Zekki skewers, Zekki soup, Zekki stew, Zekki salad, and more, but a true native prefers it raw.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Saltshield Snapper

Where freshwater leaves this soft-shelled chelonian exposed, the briny waters of its natural habitat serve to calcify its carapace into an impregnable underwater fortress.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Meditator

This fish is in the unique habit of entering a catatonic, simulated death state in order to survive the dry season, appearing not unlike an ascetic deep in meditation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stonytongue

This hunter's streamlined brow is tailored to nabbing small fry and insects, and casts a striking contrast against the lofty peaks of Gyr Abania it inhabits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scimitarfish

This crescent-bodied fish may resemble a Gyr Abanian blade in shape, but as a weapon is better suited to slapping than slashing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blockhead

Clad in the helm and breastplate nature provided it, this hardheaded nautical juggernaut fears nothing in the open sea, and will launch itself headlong at boats that dare cross its path, occasionally capsizing them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kotsu Zetsu

A compound of the Hingashi terms “kotsu,” meaning “bone,” and “zetsu,” meaning “tongue,” referring to the oral harpoon this fish uses to spear its prey. Its tail is known to grow scarlet with age and bloodguilt.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pandamoth

Odd fish that answers the juvenile riddle “What's black and white and ends in a sordid tail?”, its existence stands as a testament to the simultaneous wonder and perversity of nature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Liopleurodon

Occasionally, nature gets it right on the first try, as evidenced by this predator's sustained reign atop the aquatic food chain. Perfectly at home in the bloodstained waters of the Ruby Sea, the voracious hunter has had no particular need to adapt or evolve since antiquity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ala Mhigan Ribbon

Underneath the undulating currents she flits and flutters, her elegantly decorated dorsal fin darting and dancing hither and thither as though celebrating a glorious triumph, hence her association with victory in local folklore.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seraphim

The lay fish seem to avert their eyes as this heaven-sent beauty floats gracefully among them, purifying the waters with her celestial presence as she swims along.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blackfin Snake Eel

Deep undercover in the seabed, the killer creeps, inching closer and closer to his crustacean mark before lunging with lethal force to shell it alive. Diners had best take caution as well, as the delicate bones that enable his swift, precise movements pose a formidable culinary challenge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweatfish

The arduous sister of the seraphim shines the glorious sunlit streaks of her Dawn Father against the ominous night sky of her Dusk Mother, and is said to be birthed from the very beads off their battle-wet brows.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hak Bitterling

This breed indigenous to the streams of the Azim Steppe protects its eggs by laying them into the calcareous shells of freshwater mollusks, endowing the offspring with a distinctly acrid flavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whitehorse

Wherever there are damselfish in distress, this gallant champion shall gallop heroically to the rescue. Bred in the harshest saltwater climes, this noble steed is up to the challenge come hells or high-saline water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sculptor

With its sawlike upper jaw this aquatic artist chisels, scrapes, and carves away at rock salt deposits for days on end, tinkering away at a mysterious form that often bears a curious resemblance to the phoebad.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pearl-eye

Many a diver's gaze has been diverted by the iridescent white orbs that shine forth from this fish's face. The relative safety of its saltwater lake environs has allowed the otherwise conspicuous species to remain as it was ages ago.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Steelshark

If ever you need aquariophiles to talk amongst themselves, give them this topic: despite its metallic hue and menacing silhouette, the steelshark is neither steel, nor a shark. Discuss.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Harutsuge

From the Hingan meaning “herald of the spring” denoting the seasonal phenomenon wherein scores upon scores of freshly hatched fry ride the currents en masse from the Ruby Sea out to the Indigo Deep.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silken Koi

Robed in luxurious scales radiating with a distinct nacreous sheen, one is tempted to reach out and feel the fabric of its scales, which are disappointingly slimy. Theories abound as to how it ended up in Plum Spring, but none in particular prevail.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hanatatsu

Its name comprising the Hingan terms “hana,” meaning nose, and “tatsu,” to stand, the peculiar branchlike protuberance for which this breed has come to be known is believed to be a development to help conceal it within the reef.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deemster

Custom once dictated that in order to call oneself a freelance proper, the sellsword first had to reel in this fish of prodigious proportions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Swordfish

Fishermen willing to cross blades with this sharp-nosed billfish are in for a scrumptious treat, should they survive the battle.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Plum Gazer

Found only in Yanxia's Plum Spring, the locals have predictably dreamt up some self-congratulatory inspirational fiction recounting how the fish was moved to scale mountains in hopes of spying the town's prize blossoms, because what other possible explanation could there be?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zekki Gator

This shark's “gator” misnomer, deriving from its Shishu origins, can be deceptive, but there is no mistaking the bloodthirsty “zekki” element, which essentially equates to “indiscriminate killer” in Hingan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wraithfish

Devastated by her husband's infidelities, the fisherman's wife hanged herself one night in the woods, and her visage would come to haunt him each day, upon the face of every fish he caught.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Castaway Chocobo Chick

Though bred specially for traversing the five seas and beyond, this captivating cloudkin slipped away from his stables before his swimming lessons were complete, and as a result, can barely keep upright in water without the aid of his trusty life preserver.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Perykos

Miniature namesake of the sea serpent Llymlaen is said to have loosed upon the world alongside Thalaos, and the diminutive breed is possessed of a temper akin to that of a little Thalaos. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gyr Abanian Chub

When spawning, the head and tail of the Gyr Abanian chub take on a lustrous hue. It is commonly believed that this change in color drastically improves the fish's otherwise mundane flavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coral Horse

A close relative of the hanatatsu, this sea horse has a body that almost exactly mimics the appearance of the coral in which it lives. So complete is this disguise, that some liken it to a ninja. Of the sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maiden's Heart

It is said that this brightly colored marimo is the soul of a fair maid who cast herself into a lake after being publicly spurned by a lover of superior social standing. Those who profess belief in this folktale are oddly unperturbed by the existence of more than one maiden's heart.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Velodyna Salmon

This species of salmon swims in the Velodyna and Hathoeva rivers. The people of Gyr Abania mark its journey upstream as a sure sign that the seasons have turned.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Purple Buckler

Warriors once hunted these snapping turtles to fashion shields from their shells, hence the descriptive name. Others, however, have long valued the creature for the invigorating properties of its flesh, either consumed directly or distilled into a potent tonic.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cardinalfish

A freshwater fish, so named for its resemblance to the vestments worn by the cardinals of Ishgard's orthodox faith.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rockfish

This fish is covered in lumpy protrusions and attaches itself to riverbeds with a sucker-like abdominal fin. In a somewhat disappointing discovery, naturalists found that the skin of a rockfish is far less rigid than its stony appearance would suggest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ukiki

This variety of Eastern sunfish makes its home in the Ruby Sea. Local fisherfolk named it for its passing resemblance to a floating log, though outsiders struggle to see the similarities.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Violet Prismfish

Upon sensing a threat to its safety, this vibrantly colored fish discharges a weak jolt of lightning-aspected energy. Though far from lethal, the sudden shock has caused many an unwary fisherman to inadvertently release his precious catch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guppy

The rainbow-like shimmer of this freshwater fish is highly prized by aquarium enthusiasts. The name is said to be derived from the Sharlayan naturalist who first discovered it, though references to any scholarly “Guppy” have never been officially confirmed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Redtail

This brightly hued cousin to the common catfish is known for literally biting off far more than it can chew─fishers oft netting weakened or dead specimens having swallowed prey too large for their narrow gullets.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mirage Mahi

With scales that sparkle like solid gold, this distant freshwater relative to the mahi-mahi is sometimes referred to by local fishers as a “river coeurl” due to its voracious appetite and violent temperament.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Alligator Snapping Turtle

Possibly not fully comprehending the inherent danger in provoking an animal with the words “alligator” and “snapping” in its name, Gyr Abanian freelancers readily partake in a harrowing drinking game that involves downing a flagon of bitter salt ale after poking and prodding one of these ill-tempered turtles' tender noses with their bare hands.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Saltmill

Named such for its uncanny ability to break underwater salt formations with its cog-like teeth, this gluttonous specimen feeds on the tiny fish that are left in the wake of its destruction. And while those fry would disagree, salt collectors who work the bleached shores of the Lochs treat saltmill sightings as a symbol of providence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ribbon Eel

Also known as the hanahige (or “flower beard”) eel by fishers of the Ruby Sea, this narrow-bodied wavekin surprisingly begins its life completely black, only taking on the brilliant blues and yellows for which it is revered after reaching adulthood.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonsai Fish

The bonsai fish's resemblance to a leafy tree branch protects the surface-swimming wavekin from hungry birds looking for their next meal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Triplespine

With needle-tipped dorsal and ventral fins, and coarse skin reminiscent of rough-spun linen, triplespines have been known to cause irritation in the fishers who make their livelihood handling the unique wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Usuginu Octopus

A thin-skinned cousin of the koromo octopus─the name usuginu literally meaning “light cloth”─this majestic cephalopod is favored by Hingan gourmands for its firm, muscular tentacles which are eaten both raw and boiled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Prismfish

One of a red prismfish's defense mechanisms includes a slight discharge of bodily heat that will serve to frighten a predator. However, so imbued with the element fire are some of the wavekin that they have been known to boil themselves when tossed in cookpots...or so fishers say.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Elder Gourami

Myriad nomad tribes of the Azim Steppe have taken to calling this otherwise unremarkable member of the gourami family “elder” for its twin beard-like ventral fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shrieker

Despite its existence being little more than a rumor, nine out of ten sailors will swear (like sailors) on their grandmothers' graves that the fabled shrieker is nearly identical in appearance to the almost-as-fabled Olgoi-Khorkhoi.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
White Goldfish

A life of solitude in the aether-starved depths of Prism Lake has left this miniature carp devoid of both color and aspect.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Firelight Goldfish

Though the modifier suggests an aspect to fire, this unique wavekin found only in Prism Lake lacks a definite aetherial charge─a trait that ultimately serves as a death sentence for the short-lived species.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hookstealer

Countless are the fishers who have cast their lines hoping to be the first to land this elusive prize─their hooks worn by the wavekin in defiance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sapphire Fan

The dorsal fin of this king among killifish is so brilliantly blue that the item was once prized by noblewomen, who would use the appendages as fans at social gatherings...that is until their stench saw them fall out of fashion.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Archbishop

Every time the largest of their school is caught, the cardinalfish hold an underwater conclave to select a new Archbishop. Or so the Vault's pious tell their bastards in the Brume before tucking them into bed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bondsplitter

There are those who believe that this enormous Enid shrimp's claws are so powerful that they can sever the very bonds of marriage. Then there are some who simply believe the claws go best with hot clarified butter.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Undecided

Despite extended research into the behavior, scholars have been unable to determine exactly why this peculiar variety of rapids jumper feels inclined to constantly travel up- and downstream, the prevailing hypothesis currently being “just because.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Diamond-eye

Countless summers swimming in heavily salinated waters have fostered the growth of salt crystals around the eyes of this near-blind, yet bedazzled wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rising Dragon

Domans have long set great store by natural remedies such as infusions made with ground hanatatsu. And as is the case with most of these remedies, the bigger the specimen, the more potent the final product is believed to be─the key word here being “believed.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gambler

Lauded by gourmands as one of the most succulent fish in the world, consumption of this delicacy comes with a risk─the flesh can prove extremely deadly unless prepared in a precise manner. Still, those who have survived claim it was worth the gamble. Those who have died were not available for comment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Winter Queen

For this ancient harutsuge, spring never comes, and while her brethren follow the warm currents to the Indigo Deep, she remains to rule the Ruby Tide in royal solitude.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rakshasa

Every year a handful of foolish youths from Sui–no–Sato will set out into the Ruby Sea in search of Rakshasa─lord of the Zekki gators and one of the fastest predators of the deep─and every year, all fail to return. Though, this year's foolish youths claim they have a good feeling about their chances.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bokuden

This wavekin was aptly dubbed Bokuden─wandering swordsman of legend─after a territorial scuffle saw three score samurai fish float to the surface of the waters before Doma Castle.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hagoromo Koi

Legend has that this white-scaled wavekin is an angel who fell in love with a mortal and was transformed into a koi and cast from the heavens by her father as punishment. Correction: <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> an angel.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Word of God

The Mol believe they are made to endure divine trials that they must overcome to prove their worth. Catching a blessed Tao bitterling was one of these trials. Seeing as they did not catch it, their god will now punish them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yat Khan

Is there none who would dispute this goby's claim to the rule of Yat Khaal? If you answered “no,” you would be correct.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Curefish

The bones of the curefish─a curious specimen that will often wear the skull of drowned beasts to frighten away predators─are thought to possess curative properties, making them a popular commodity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lake Sphairai

A cousin to the coeurlfish with teeth said to be as sharp as legendary Sphairai; though, it is not recommended to discard of your actual Sphairai should you happen upon one of these wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Warmscale Pleco

The ability to manipulate fire aether allows this wavekin to heat its dorsal fin which, in turn, warms the surrounding waters, enabling it to survive even the coldest of climes. The fin will exhibit these qualities for moons after being removed from the fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shirogane Clam

Not only does this mollusk produce invaluable pearls, but its shells are treasured by goldsmiths across Hingashi for their unmatched luster.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Illuminati Mask

This rare cephalopod, loosely related to the goblin's mask, not only has skin with a bluish tinge, but will blind its enemies with a blast of indigo ink, making it difficult for fishers <Emphasis>not</Emphasis> to call it by its current colorful name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Indigo Prismfish

The mysterious dark hues of this wavekin are only achieved through the rare mating of a violet and a blue prismfish, making the specimens highly sought-after.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Green Prismfish

An overabundance of wind-aspected aether stored within this bloated carp's body provides the wavekin with a weapon to neutralize its prey of choice─namely winged insects and small birds that come down from the safety of the skies to drink.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Watcher Catfish

Named after renowned monk Widargelt the Watcher, this electric catfish is capable of releasing a concentrated burst of lightning-aspected aether from its body powerful enough to stun prey up to three times its size.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloodtail Zombie

Local fisher legend has that this catfish died choking on a meal too large to slide down its gullet...only to return to the river of its unholy spawning to feed on the brains of lesser fries.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardhead Trout

If fishers are to be believed (and they are not), this elder steelhead has a knob as hard as Garlean cermet─a deadly weapon it wields to pummel senseless would-be competitors come mating season.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Downstream Loach

This giant loach will use its powerful fins to propel itself to the top of low waterfalls where it will lie in wait, fighting against the current, until it spots suitable prey in the pool below. Once its sights have been set, the loach will leap off the edge and subdue its prey from above.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Corpse Chub

The ruthlessness this wavekin has shown hoarding a lake's prey to the point of starving all other chubs in the area has earned it rightful comparisons to Thanalan's infamous Corpse Brigade.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Last Tear

It is said that this Abalathian salamander achieved such prodigious girth by lapping up the tears shed by the countless mourners to have visited the lichyard at Hidden Tear since the Calamity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hemon

A pair of large bulging eyes have earned this wavekin the unfortunate moniker Hemon─the same name as an infamous Peeping Tom who was executed after being caught spying on the mad king Theodoric's wife as she soaked in her chambers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moksha

Fisher monks of the Gyr Abanian Peaks claim this wavekin escaped death during the Calamity by entering a deep meditative state. Five summers later, upon attaining true enlightenment, the meditator awoke, and now swims the highland waters once more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Princess Killifish

Only one in every thousand thousand killifish are born with a light golden hue for which collectors will literally commit regicide...or at least abduction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ku'er

A bastardization of the Eorzean word “coeurl,” this uniquely patterned wavekin's name was given by Doman fishers who had read of the legendary leonine beasts of the Far West in poorly translated copies of Gridania's foremost publication, <Emphasis>The Raven</Emphasis>.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Argonautica

As most of the sumptuous wavekin are snatched up by Far Eastern fishers, rarely does a snake eel reach the size of this monstrous serpent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hagoromo Bijin

The billowing fins of this Far Eastern seraphim are oft compared to a kimono featured in a famous painting of a legendary angelic being.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Duskfish

Xaela legend has that this massive wavekin was born from a scale shed by the Dawn Father. Scholars insist it has simply had the good fortune not to be eaten.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blade Skipper

Several of the Azim Steppe's nomadic tribes believe this blood skipper, native to the One River, leapt from the depths of its Yanxian home and rode the thick blades of lush Steppe grass all the way north and east to the upper Yat Khaal where it now dwells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lily of the Veil

The eccentricities of noblewomen in pre-occupation Gyr Abania knew no bounds, one such involving the overgrown dorsal fins of Ala Mhigan ribbons which were worn as veils at various social functions. To which, the fish eventually earned the moniker Lily of the Veil─a play on words the ladies surely believed droll.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vegetarian

Covered in both bone-hard scales and countless deadly spikes─spikes which, upon close inspection, appear to be covered in spikes of their own─this slightly bioluminescent specimen is a king among liopleurodons, and lord of the waters near Hells' Lid.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seven Stars

Like stars in the night sky, the maw of this tawny wench shark is pocked with scars left by the myriad attempts of lesser fishers to claim this lofty prize.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pinhead

The ladies-in-waiting who serve the Ruby Princess are said to weave their ruler's silken gowns with the spines of this deadly globefish known to stalk its victims to the Seventh Hell.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pomegranate Trout

It is said that the jewel-like roe of this rare Doman trout has spawned a thousand wars─the blood of those who would fight and die to acquire such a delicacy proving the only thing redder than the eggs themselves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glarramundi

Eastern fishers will swear that the demon-like eyes of this unique river barramundi will follow you, no matter where you stand. More than one charlatan has sought to profit off this phenomenon, harvesting the eyes from fish markets and selling them to Eorzean alchemists under the guise of “voidsent optics.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hermit's End

Residents of the Doman mountain village of Namai claim this plump nogoi to be a hermit who, having grown weary of the monotony of his life, transformed himself into a fish, that he might pass his remaining years without care for the burdens of mankind.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Suiten Ippeki

Meaning the “deep blue of sea and sky,” its name was coined by a poet who once viewed the brilliant salmon swimming the crystal-clear waters of the One River and claimed it was as if the very heavens had descended from above.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Axelrod

Most would have you believe that this overlarge Yanxian barramundi was named after local smallfolk witnessed the wavekin attempt to swallow the axel of a Kojin's barrow that had fallen into the One River. The truth of the matter is that it was not the barrow that fell into the river, but the Kojin himself...who just so happened to be named Axelrod.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Unraveled Bow

Legend states that, arrested by the sheer brilliance of a rainbow bestraddled athwart Prism Canyon, an angel from on high plucked a band from the bow and whispered unto it the secret of life. The band then slipped from her hand to the water below where it became an eel as green as jade.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nhaama's Treasure

Believed by many of the Azim Steppe's Xaela tribes to be a gift from the Dusk Mother herself, this large wavekin is oft presented as a reward in contests of mettle held during sacred festivals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garden Skipper

Some of the Othard's nomadic tribes view this large green skipper as an ill omen that their journey is about to end, and have been known to go as far as abandoning their fishing rods to the river rather than risk reeling one in.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Banderole

The banderole earns its name from its pinion-like dorsal fin that is so large it is oft mistaken for a Xaelan standard fallen into the khaal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern Oyster

Ishgardians are known to treasure this cold-water shellfish, despite the extreme difficulty both harvesting the wavekin and opening their vice-like shells to retrieve the succulent flesh hidden within. A method of preparation popular amongst the See's nobles involves boiling the oysters to create a thin broth, and then tossing the meat to their hounds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Laver

A long-standing staple amongst the costal villages along the Ruby Sea, this nutrient-rich seaweed finds its way into most every dish, from breakfast to supper. It is even added to rice wine to enhance its flavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Chakrafish

Bemoaning her inability to open even a single chakra, a monk set off into the hills to meditate. For ten days and ten nights did she fast, until on the eleventh day, overcome with hunger, she spied a lone fish in a shallow pond. Unable to control herself, the monk lunged atop the fry and sank her teeth into its sweet, cold flesh...at which time she opened all seven chakra, achieving enlightenment everlasting.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wicked Wartfish

Cursed with a face so ugly, it is said demons of the underworld use the wartfish to frighten souls attempting to escape into returning to hell.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Othardian Salmon

The light and flaky flesh of the Othardian salmon pairs well with the aromatic rice wines of Hingashi, making the fish a highly sought-after commodity throughout the realm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Warden of the Seven Hues

Supposedly spawned white as bone, local legend attributes this uncanny carp's now brilliantly colored scales to extended exposure to the waters of Prism Lake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Xenacanthus

Scholars have yet to determine the functionality of the massive spine that protrudes from the specimen's head, reaching back almost to its dorsal fin. Some claim it to be a means of delivering poison to would-be predators, while others suggest it may be an antenna that aids in the location of prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Drepanaspis

Lack of a fully developed jawbone has forced this fish to find other ways to feed─namely by swallowing up large swaths of seafloor mud to sup on the insignificant species that wriggle and writhe within. As such, the drepanaspis exhibits no interest in normal prey, making it a difficult catch for enterprising fishers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stethacanthus

Male stethacanthus vie for reproductive supremacy amongst their species by focusing internal aetherial energy to engender queer saline growths upon their dorsal fins─the size of which is the sole factor in the females' selection of a suitable mate. The crystals can swell to sizes so large that they oft render the wavekin completely motionless.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ruby Dragon

Its name known to strike fear into babes and fishers alike, tales of this saltwater legend have been told for nigh on a thousand summers. The most popular telling has that the Ruby Dragon was once a great auspice who willingly succumbed to the aramitama that he might be freed from its burden.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Unconditional

Possessed of both a dorsal fin not unlike a crescent moon, and a tail fin not unlike the rising sun, this distinctive wavekin is believed by nomads of the Azim Steppe to be the corporeal manifestation of the Dusk Mother and Dawn Father's love for their children on Hydaelyn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eighteyes Eel

The seven sets of small fins arranged along its length were first believed to be eyes, lending this wavekin its name. Its secretions are said to be effective against ocular ailments—it would seem its discoverer did not think to rub their eyes with eel oil before leaping to judgment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystal Knife

This wavekin is named for its resemblance to a blade of sharp, thin crystal─so much so that rumor has it the Crystal Exarch once mistakenly attempted to open his correspondence with one.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Laxan Carp

These scaly swimmers were once ten a gil in Lakeland, before being driven to extinction by the Flood. Now they exist only in the experimental breeding beds of the Crystarium.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Asteroidea

These bright blue starfish are used by the educators of the Crystarium to teach children about the stars, leading their nights to be filled with terrors about the wriggling, writhing, five-fingered fiends that lurk unseen in the skies above them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard Candy

When sea beasts suck these algal organisms into their maws, it looks as if they are sucking on sweets─hence the unusual name. In truth, they are soft, sticky, and taste of seaweed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abyssal Snail

A purple-shelled snail that feeds on the leaves of Lakeland plants. It is named not for any hellish qualities of its own, but after its shell's resemblance to the horns of a legendary demon from the deep.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean Saucer

A flat white fish that resembles the spotless crockery of a tea drinker indisposed to spillage. Its underside is a vivid purple─hang around in taverns long enough, and you're bound to hear the tale of how the clean saucer got its bruised bottom sooner or later.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabbit Skipper

With its white and red eyes, long earlike fins and proclivity for hopping to and fro on the surface of the water, this wavekin would seem to be a rabbit born in the wrong body. Scholars hypothesize that they feed mainly on carrots, but this is as yet unconfirmed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Water Ball

An albino subspecies of the official balls common to Il Mheg. Scholars believe that the ancestors of these freshwater wavekin were shunned by their brightly colored cousins and fled to Lakeland to begin a new life, free from pigment-based prejudice.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Xanthic Bass

A wavekin stained a vibrant amber hue from tip to tail. Some say that this curious coloration serves as protection from the blazing rays of the Flood. Those of a more fabulous bent insist that its yellow belly is but a physical manifestation of its cowardly nature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Albino Garfish

These highly territorial wavekin spawn in the seas off the Isle of Ken, tearing into any aquatic creatures fool enough to stray into their waters with rows of razor-sharp teeth. Their dominion over the island's waves has led some fishers to dub them the “Ken Masters.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Albino Caiman

A ferocious hunter that lurks in shallow waters, waiting for its prey to stray too close before it strikes. When its pure white body bursts through the surface of a blood-stained lake, it resembles nothing more than a blob of fresh cream atop a rolanberry coulis. But with more teeth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Skulleater

These scavengers of the deep have a habit of breaking open the heads of drowned sailors with their oversized pincers, before feasting on the grey goodness within and taking up residence in the cleaned-out crania. This earns them few friends in sailing circles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Toffee Snail

The sweet, chewy flesh of these mollusks, flavored with aromatic herbs, is a staple of Kholusian cuisine. The culinary tome “Of Ye Kholusian Kytchenne” also lists recipes for the waffle wasp and the mousse louse─the only known reference to either creature. This has led some scholars to doubt the book's authenticity. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Watts Trout

A familiar face to all those living along Watts River, this fish has long been an important source of protein for the dwarves who dwell there. When a fisher catches a Watts trout, it is customary to call out its name─the traditional reply being “You should know, you've just caught one.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
South Kholusian Cod

This fish is far-famed for its soft, flaky flesh, often forming the centerpiece of a Kholusian banquet. Their erstwhile cousins, the north Kholusian cod, were tougher in both body and spirit, but not tough enough to survive the Flood─now, only the southern softies remain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kholusian Flounder

Legend has it that these flat, bottom-dwelling wavekin are the reincarnations of those poor, unfortunate souls who wasted away on the road to Eulmore, and chose to throw themselves into the ocean in order to end their suffering early.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shellfracture Kelp

A marine plant that grows in great beds off Cracked Shell Beach. It wraps its meaty leaves around marine mollusks, providing protection in exchange for stability. However, as the kelp grows, its grip tightens and the shells shatter. Below the water, as above, we always hurt the ones we love.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Cloud

With their round, red bodies, these wavekin look like so many balloons floating in the summer sky, trailing their strings behind them. But be very wary, for their strings pack a deadly sting. If you should chance upon a swarm whilst swimming, let those red balloons go by.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rose Shrimp

This pretty pink shrimp is a boon to any budding culinarian, lending a fine flavor to many a delicious dish. Some scholars claim that schools of these creatures take the shape of a blooming rose─others that the name is based only on their coloration. So long as argumentative academics abound, the debate may never end.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sand Egg

Though it looks every ilm an egg, it is in fact a creature in its own right, capable of independent ambulation and feeding on the nutrients in the desert dew. Those that have spent many moons beneath the sands develop a curiously smoky aroma.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lover's Flower

A species of sea hare with pretty pink fins like the petals of a flower. However, present the apple of your eye with a posy of these creatures, and your love will surely be nipped in the bud─despite all appearances, they are vicious, flesh-eating fiends.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystarium Tetra

A fish with lustrous blue scales, like the light that dapples the streets of the Crystarium. None know for sure whether this is a deliberate form of camouflage, or if the unfortunate fish have been displaced into the one location where their mating displays blend into their surroundings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sinspitter

Their white scales and winglike fins are redolent of the sin eaters, which earned them the enmity of the citizens of the Crystarium. After realizing the error of their ways, they gave the fish the name “sinspitter” to mark them out as an enemy of their enemy─and therefore, a friend.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jacketed Snail

Despite the name, this creature is not a true snail, nor does it wear clothes. It changes its “jacket” each season as it sheds its outer skin, swapping between a coeurl-skin pattern and a sleek, velveteen look. This makes it one of the most fashionable gastropods in the sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Milky Coral

Bleached coral that bloomed in the seas around Eulmore after the Flood. Pieces oft wash up on the nearby shores, where those who starve in the city's shadows use it to craft jewelry to sell for scraps. Some say the coral looks just like day-old meol, but this may be just a hunger-addled daydream.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gravel Mussel

Tiny, slate-grey shellfish that are oft mistaken for small stones. Those with keen eyes and a stomach as empty as their schedules can spend hour after hour picking through pebbles to find these mussels, from which a nourishing broth can be brewed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonefish

With virtually flavorless flesh and more bones than a graveyard, this fish only graces the plates of those who can afford nothing else. After the handouts of meol began, the bonefish has all but disappeared from the diets of even the most desperate citizens.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Misty Killifish

A translucent fish whose internal organs can be seen through its skin, shining redly like the setting sun. When raised in an aquarium, the organs redden even further, perhaps in embarrassment at having their private parts put on display.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Snakeskin Discus

A wavekin whose scales form a mottled pattern like the skin of a snake. The size of the spots hardly changes from fryhood to adulthood, rather increasing in number as it grows. The pattern protects the fish from dunderheaded predators, who mistake this small, round, flat fish for a dangerous constrictor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Albino Rock Crab

A surfeit of aether in its home waters has blanched this crab of all color. However, it takes on a bright, scarlet hue when blanched in boiling water. This sudden and surprising transformation is enough to make one blanch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Noble's Fan

The emerald hue and peacock pattern of this flatfish is reminiscent of the fans favored by the nobles of Eulmore. Many of those refused entry to the city dream of exchanging the two, so that the pampered peers take a wet fish to the face.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zebra Catfish

A fish with the whiskers of a cat, and the black-and-white stripes of the mythical zebra. Not to be confused with the apocryphal cat zebrafish, which has the calico coloration of a fat cat, and hooves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sepia Sole

The name of this wavekin calls to mind the underside of a shoe, whose once-polished leather has turned dull and grey from overuse. Some would use the same simile to describe both the appearance and taste of its cured and dried flesh─a delicacy in Kholusia.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spearhead Squid

Every part of this marine mollusk can be eaten, from the sharp point of the hood that earns it its name, to the ink that flows forth when it is angered. Soldiers of the Eulmoran Army are known to devour a squid in its entirety before battle, believing it lends them martial might.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shapeshifter

This eight-armed marine mollusk is able to disguise itself as almost anything else—from starfish, to seaweed, to other fish. But only an object of equal size. And it cannot form complex machines. Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts. It doesn't work that way.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kholusian Wrasse

Only male Kholusian wrasse have the characteristic lump on their foreheads—and yet every one plucked from the waves has this lump. How so? Are the males less intelligent, falling for the fisher's tricks more easily? Or are they braver, selflessly throwing themselves on the hook? No. Every wrasse is born female, before changing genders in later life.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Razorfish

A wavekin with a body as sleek and sharp as a barber's blade. While they are able to swim facing forwards, razorfish are wont to keep their eyes fixed on the sea floor, as if afraid to make eye contact with more sociable swimmers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Weedy Seadragon

A frond-finned creature named for its resemblance to the sunny-hued leaves of the shellfracture kelp, not for its puniness. Although, in a fight between a weedy seadragon and a strip of seaweed, a wise man might bet on the latter.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadow Crab

These creatures normally lurk beneath the surface of the sand with only their eyes protruding, but when prey approach they burst forth, bludgeoning their victims with bulky claws before slinking back to the shadows.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Dustfish

Because they spend most of their lives under the scorching sand, desert dustfish have evolved to store large quantities of water within their bodies. For travelers lost in arid climes, these creatures are like life-saving oases, but in fish form.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Amber Lamprey

Bloodsucking beasts who sup from the veins of travelers who stray into their territory. Their bodies darken the more they drink, with the greediest guzzlers taking on a scarlet hue. There's an old phrase in desert-trekking circles—if you see red, run.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wandering Catfish

These catfish swim in the waters around the Wandering Stairs, their fins sloshing sleepily around the pub's sleepy, sloshed patrons. And like those same patrons, they survive almost entirely on bar snacks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Skeletonfish

With the exception of its skeleton, this fish's body is almost completely transparent. Unscrupulous traders in exotic wavekin will sometimes attempt to pass off the rehydrated remains of their supper as one of these, so buyers beware.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Sea Spider

This ocean arachnid is almost all legs. While the realm's dwarves turn green with jealousy, the spider prefers to adopt an eye-catching red hue, making it a prized specimen in the aquariums of Eulmoran collectors.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vicejaw

One of the largest of the ancient order of armor-plated fish, the vicejaw's aggression and hardheadedness reminds many of Lord Vauthry. And like Lord Vauthry, it terrorizes its neighbors—those neighbors being its fellow fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Creamy Oyster

Named for its pale white hue and rich, buttery flavor, the creamy oyster is more than a mere delicacy—the curators of the Cabinet of Curiosity have discovered they have curative properties too, being particularly effective against unwelcome eating habits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Minstrelfish

“The captain, he caught me in bed with his bride, and threw my best lute o'er the galleon's side. I followed it over—to catch it I wished, but all that I caught was a lute-shapen fish. Yes I tickled his wife, then I tickled a fish.” - The Ballad of the Minstrelfish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hornhelm

The large horn that protrudes from this wavekin's head is in fact a modified dorsal fin, adapted for swimming through sand. In the areas around its nesting grounds, rulers will oft be anointed with a crown of these horns, due to the strength they represent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Web-footed Sand Gecko

A scalekin that is specially adapted for traversing over sand. The membranes between its toes prevent it from sinking into even the softest sand. They also make the creature a strong swimmer, although it gets little practice in its desert home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Grey Skipper

The grey skipper provides a rare drop of shade in the Kingdom of Rainbows. It has its origins in the Kingdom of Voeburt and remains staunchly loyal to its former masters, refusing to engage in any way with the pixies' magicks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cerulean Loach

Legend has it that this wavekin is descended from a drop of blue sky that fell from the heavens before they were filled with all-encompassing light. The black star shape around its eye isn't accounted for.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pixie Fish

Nu Mou chroniclers tell that there was once a pixie who wished to swim like a fish. They muttered a magic word to transform themself into a freshwater wavekin, and frolicked in the water. But when they went to reverse the spell, they found that their mouth produced no sound—only bubbles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Official Ball

This motley wavekin is preferred by the Fuath to serve as the ball in several of their underwater sports, thanks to its peaceable nature and nigh on spherical body. The fish itself has never been asked its preference.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cherry Herring

The eggs this wavekin lays are almost indistinguishable from glacé cherries, making them highly prized by the pixies, fond as they are of practical jokes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eulmore Butterfly

This wavekin is highly prized for its beauty among Eulmoran nobles. Such is its popularity, several of the high houses are known to have bonded able fishers to their employ, for the sole purpose of keeping their butterfly stocks maintained.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Hammerhead

There was once a blacksmith who forged for the high houses of Eulmore. Unlike his steel, the man was quick to temper. None know for certain what drove him to murder his masters, but he and his bloody hammer were thrown into the ocean, to be reborn as this very wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood-eyed Frog

These frogs are fawned over by the Fuath, who think of them as adorable infants. Some are even known to craft miniature top hats for their unwitting charges.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spotted Blue-eye

This freshwater fish's translucent fins flutter like a butterfly as it swims, while its golden scales shine like a suit of polished mail. If the butterflies were ever to don armor and take up arms against the adventuring races, their swarms might overpower us all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lemonfish

This citrus-skinned pufferfish produces an acidic poison from an internal gland, from which a delicious-yet-deadly dressing can be prepared. Should the pixies present you with a suspiciously sour salad, you would be wise to feign fullness.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rebel

A wavekin that likes to swim against the stream. When kept in a wood-paneled aquarium, it prefers to position itself against the grain. No one is sure as to the cause of this unusual behavior—perhaps there isn't one.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wild Red Betta

Named not for habitat, but for its rough and rambunctious behavior, the fun-loving Fuath have made a sport of teasing the wild red betta, tugging at its fins before fleeing from the ensuing maelstrom of rage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Lobster

Prized as a status symbol by the noble families of Eulmore, who will often dispatch bonded servants to Il Mheg in search of a shiny prize. Alas, the fae folk have other ideas, more often than not transforming the trespassing lobster hunters into leafmen.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Clawbow

A small crustacean named for its oversized left pincer, which lends it the appearance of an archer holding a greatbow. As one might expect, the crab is unable to shoot arrows from its arms—only dirty looks from its beady eyes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yellow Pipira

The yellow pipira appears a docile creature, drifting leisurely in warm waters. However, its teeth are coated with a paralyzing toxin, with which it immobilizes its prey before eating them alive. Appearances can be deceptive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oathfish

This wavekin resides in the waters of Woven Oath, and would be utterly unremarkable were it not for the role it plays in the rites of the Children of the Everlasting Dark, who burn it black over a bonfire before consuming the ashen remains.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brightmirror Clam

These clams, whose inner nacre can be polished to a mirror sheen, were common throughout the Kingdom of Voeburt. Looking glasses crafted from their shells were fashionable with the ladies of the Voeburtite court before its fall.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wimple Carp

This wavekin has a characteristic white hood resembling the headdresses worn by women of a certain religious order. Rumor has it that wimple carp are actually white all over—their black stripes are merely the inky scrawls of tricksy pixies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spotted Ctenopoma

Some of the First have jokingly nicknamed them the “Ronso of the Water” for their brown spotted scales, reminiscent of the pattern adorning certain Ronso's coats─if one squints.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rak'tika Trout

These freshwater wavekin embark on great migrations around the waterways of Norvrandt, only returning to the Greatwood to spawn. Their ascent of the mighty falls of Lozatl's Conquest is one of the wonders of fishkind.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkroot

These dark-skinned eels spend much of their lives lurking in shadowy shallows, disguising themselves as roots of the black-boughed trees of the Greatwood. The Children of the Everlasting Dark think very highly of them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Night's Bass

Introduced to the Greatwood to provide sustenance for the colonies of the Night's Blessed, this is a fecund and fast-growing fish. However, some argue that the bass's proliferation risks unbalancing the river's delicate ecosystem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robber Crab

According to popular belief, this crab climbs trees and steals fruit from their branches, but this is naught but a tall tale. In truth, it is an omnivorous scavenger, feeding on fallen fruit and carrion alike.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garik Crab

With its burly body and claws covered in bristly hairs that resemble the work mitts worn by miners, this crustacean became something of a symbol of pride to the pitmen of Garik, before they all moved away.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Clown Tetra

A wavekin whose scales are striped with two subdued hues—grey and dark grey. Its fry emerge from their eggs a gaudy orange color before their scales darken with age, along with their outlooks on life.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eryops

In ancient Ronka, the eryops was revered as a sacred animal, believing it to be the bringer of prosperity to one's children. Those whose offspring have been bitten by these beasts for the crime of swimming in their waters may beg to differ.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Diamond Pipira

A silvery cousin of the yellow pipira, this fish's brightly shining scales have earned it the enmity of the Children of the Everlasting Dark. But no matter how many the Children lift from the lakes, they cannot seem to eliminate them entirely.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hucho Taimen

Though it appears to be a gentle giant, this cousin of the salmon has a voracious appetite for the flesh of other fish, swallowing other wavekin whole—sometimes even those approaching its own size.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nabaath Manta

An airborne ray that glides through the valleys of the Hills of Amber. Before the empire's decline, the nobles of Nabaath would hunt these creatures for sport, mounting them on their walls with winglike fins outspread, as if still in flight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silver Kitten

A small, silvery fish with feline whiskers that is oft seen basking on the riverbed like a cat resting in the sun. It is possessed of catlike reflexes too, pouncing on passing prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Tri-star

The sorcerer priests of ancient Ronka would divine the size of the fishing harvest for that year by examining the pattern of black spots along this wavekin's length. Whether or not they were able to do this with any accuracy is unproven.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stormfish

The flesh of this migratory wavekin is a staple food of the Ondo. Stormfish travel in schools many thousands strong, and when they swarm in circles, they can create great whirlpools upon the surface of the sea. Superstitious sailors refuse to sup upon their meat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sycorax

The iridescent sheen of the sycorax's shell is the result of the aether incorporated into its shell. This crystallized magick is also the source of its unusual name, which is that of a witch of legend, or so the scholars believe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Winged Hatchetfish

This wavekin's bloated belly and long tail lend it the silhouette of a hand axe, leading the metal-smelting dwarves of Kholusia to venerate it as a guardian spirit of the toolcrafting industry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Amber Monkfish

Swimming through the golden sands of Amh Araeng, this fish's camouflaged coloration provides protection against predators. To defend against the desert heat, it deposits a thick layer of fat beneath its skin, making its steaks something of a delicacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Saw

The eight jagged spines along its back help this creature to cut through the sand as it swims. It also uses them as a weapon, slicing open the bellies of oversized prey before eating them from the inside out.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maneater Clam

The fang-like serrations along its shell lend this mollusk a menacing appearance, but it is in fact a filter feeder whose jaws close but sluggishly. Not to say that a man-eater clam could not do the deed, just that said man would have to be deep in his cups at the time.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweetflesh Oyster

This bivalve's shell resembles nothing more than a chunk of solid slate, but split it open, and a sweet, meaty morsel awaits within. A welcome discovery to all, with the possible exception of roofers with sated stomachs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Sea Spider

Though physically similar to the spiders who walk on land, this creature is of an entirely unrelated order. The majority of its internal organs, including its heart and gills, are situated in its spindly legs, the body serving primarily as a nexus through which the vital fluids flow.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Purple Coral

Violet-colored coral that blooms only in the bathyal depths. An ancient prophecy dictates that any pieces found on the shore should be offered to the nobility to stave off disaster—dark tidings of smoke upon the water and fire filling the sky...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Caliban

One of the few surviving members of an ancient family of armor-plated fish. The name comes from Ondo legend, which tells of the great fish god Caliban. He breathed life into one of His shed scales, and named the creature that sprung forth after Himself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ancient Shrimp

This crustacean uses its long, thin pincers to pry its prey from the gaps between rocks. It is the progenitor of the modern rock lobster, but the increased water pressure of its deepwater habitat makes its flesh denser and more flavorful.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyan Sea Devil

Feared by sailors as a demon of the deep, this misunderstood cephalopod's habit of wrapping its slimy tentacles around mariners' legs and dragging them into the ink-stained seas is merely its way of showing affection.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stippled Eel

A single stippled eel's position in underwater society is largely dependent on the pattern of stripes and spots on its skin, with the most desirable individuals staking claim to the most desirable territory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Platinum Guppy

A freshwater fish with beautiful, iridescent fins. Though native to the First, the name “guppy” was bestowed upon it by the Crystal Exarch himself, apparently after a naturalist from his native land.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Henodus

A type of primordial turtle with a wide, flat shell. Its name means “one tooth” in an ancient tongue, in reference to the single molar in each corner of its mouth. That, along with its wrinkled skin, has led some to nickname it the “Old Man of the Sea.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thorned Lizard

The spiny plates that cover this scalekin from the top of its nose to tip of its tail have led some to nickname it the knight of the desert. It traverses the sands by biting its tail and rolling along like a tumbleweed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Toadhead

Some scholars say that the large, bubble-like bags under its eyes are this shortsighted wavekin's way to make predators believe it sees more than it does. Others insist that it is merely sleep-deprived.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkdweller

A fish found only in the deepest, darkest parts of deep, dark caves. It is completely blind, with naught but scales where other wavekin have eyes, making them both revered and envied by the Children of the Everlasting Dark.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hoodwinker

A large, round, slow-swimming fish that seems like it would be easy pickings for a predator. However, when an attacker approaches, it spins its body from side to side, delivering stinging slaps with its swinging fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bubble Angler

This wavekin's translucent body looks like an air bubble when it puffs itself up. This is thought to be a form of protective camouflage, but the ingenious disguise leads to other dangers, as on spotting its floating form, divers become inflamed with a desire to pop it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yeti Crab

A crustacean covered in thick, white fur like that of the yetis who haunt the snowfields of Coerthas. Its eyestalks are underdeveloped compared to other crabs—instead of relying on eyesight, it navigates its surroundings by detecting the aether in the water with its hairs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rainbow Shrimp

This crustacean's multicolored coat serves as a warning signal. Though the shrimp is not poisonous, one would still be wise to give it a wide berth, as it ferociously attacks prey and potential predator alike with rapid swings of its hooklike claws.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ondobane

Easily identified by its bright blue skin, these sharks have long brought terror to the seabed settlements of the Ondo. Only those who have bested the blue bane in single combat are allowed to call themselves true warriors.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seatrap

Though it bears a close resemblance to the flytraps of the land, this is no plant, but rather a form of anemone. The seatrap takes any fish fool enough to stray too close into a tentacular embrace, though it means them anything but affection.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stargazer

A wavekin that lies under the seabed sand, its eyes staring straight up at the heavens. The Ondo were first introduced to the concept of the stars when an adventurer from the shore visited their seabed settlements and explained this fish's unusual name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pancake Octopus

This deep-sea octopus is well-known, and well loved, for its plump and adorable form. However, when lifted from the water, it is unable to maintain its shape against the force of gravity and falls as flat as a pancake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Predator

This wavekin spends its days lying in the shadows with its mouth closed, waiting for fish to float by. When suitable prey appears, the predator's kite-shaped jaws fly open and swallow it whole, before it returns to the shadows to rest, ruminate, and digest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ondo Harpoon

Named for its resemblance to the fish people's hunting implements. It is unknown whether the similarity is merely incidental, or if the original Ondo took inspiration from the shark's unusual shape when crafting their weapons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aapoak

A rare, iridescent cousin of the nautilus. Fisherfolk consider it an omen of future fortune to find one in their nets—and not only because goldsmiths pay a high price for their scooped-out shells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweetmeat Mussel

Kholusians have feasted on the juicy innards of these pitch-black mollusks since time immemorial. The ale sauce in which they are often served gives the dish its distinct flavor, while the mussels themselves are noticeably more succulent than most other varieties.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Loose Pendant

Its shimmering blue scales sparkle with such intensity that it even stands out against the vibrant blue hues of the Crystarium, in which it dwells. A popular tale among the residents describes a jeweler who tried to scoop one such fish out of the water to turn it into a necklace, only to fall in and almost drown. Few have attempted the feat since, with most fishers opting for more traditional methods.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Winged Dame

This close relative to the Eulmore butterfly is believed to have originally been bred in captivity before escaping from its tank into the waters of Kholusia, possibly after being poured into the sea during a domestic dispute. The manner in which it swims positively exudes elegance, which is possibly the result of its privileged upbringing. Privileged by wavekin standards, at any rate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Unforgiven

Its pure white coloration has led many to speculate that it is in fact a sin eater, which while far from the truth, provides a convenient excuse for fishers who return empty-handed after attempting to snare this formidable creature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bronze Sole

This well camouflaged flatfish moves with remarkable grace despite being covered in hard scales. Those mistaking it for the similar─yet far more edible─sepia sole are in for a nasty surprise should they attempt to take a bite without first removing the skin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Horned King

This elusive wavekin is prized for the hornlike fins that protrude through the sand. The crown princes of Nabaath Areng once hunted them as part of their passage into manhood, though it is rumored that those who lacked the skill to catch their own bought the horns from enterprising fishers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sound of Fury

While wild red betta are known for their limitless aggression, this particular specimen lives only to viciously torment its fellow wavekin. The manner in which it unrelentingly attacks foes much larger than itself is enough to give even the Fuath reason to avoid this flame-red horror.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Priest of Yx'Lokwa

Many of the inhabitants of Fanow believe that this ferocious amphibian serves the Ronkan water gods, guarding the temple from evildoers. Few realize that it is simply a voracious predator that is quite content to devour anything and everything, regardless of any wicked thoughts its prey may or may not be having.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Starchaser

With its eyes pointing ever upwards in much the same manner as the smaller stargazers, it lurks beneath the sand to ambush its unsuspecting prey. The Ondo have long believed that this particular species is swift enough to pluck a shooting star from the heavens, hence its name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Laxan Inkhorn

Since ancient times, scholars have coveted this species of gastropod, not as a source of nutrition, but for the purple ink-like liquid that seeps out when it is disturbed. So common a sight were the discarded shells in the educational institutions of Lakeland that the creature came to be seen as a symbol of man's desire to pass on his knowledge to future generations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
White Oil Perch

Fishers are often amused by the nonchalant expression on the faces of these wavekin, even when dangling from a line with a hook in their mouth. Their sedate manner is also seen in the way they slowly drift around the pool at the bottom of White Oil Falls, which is said to make their meat wonderfully tender, whether fried or left in the sun to dry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Faeshine Clam

Although the pearls produced are indescribably beautiful, it is believed that each time one of these glistening orbs is used in the crafting of necklaces, brooches and the like, somebody is spirited away to the land of the faeries, never to be seen again. Some would claim that this is a small price to pay for such exquisite jewelry, however.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Areng Dire

The Nabaath word “areng,” or “land,” is well known to residents of Amh Araeng, despite its language of origin having fallen out of common use. Fewer are those who know the meaning of “dire”─“shield,” but scholars surmise that this scalekin was named for its semblance to a crawling bulwark. Its light-yet-sturdy shell can be used to make armor, though it has become difficult to obtain since the Flood.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kholusian King Crab

Until recent years, it was believed that these ungainly wavekin were swallowed by the Flood of Light, unable to escape due to the unbelievably slow pace at which they move. Whether they survived thanks to their natural resilience or through sheer luck remains a mystery, though many were glad to see these edible crustaceans return in great numbers to the waters of Kholusia. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Jaws of Undeath

Researchers have termed their imposing nests “fortresses,” a word that, while perhaps grandiose, befits their makers' position at the top of the food chain. Woe betide any who encroaches upon one of these “fortresses,” for its castellan will defend it as fiercely as would any on land.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
White Ronso

The black-and-white stripes which adorn its body resemble a rare pattern of Ronso fur. The similarities between the two end there, however, as this fish's glower is known to cause people to soil themselves in laughter rather than terror.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambling Caltrop

This wavekin's hide becomes sturdier and heavier as it ages, perhaps to protect it from the ocean's myriad predators. Of particular note are records from Nabaath Areng of a peculiar punishment in which criminals were made to wear attire fashioned from this hide, its weight serving as a literal burden of guilt. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fae Rainbow

Legend tells of an overcurious pixie who tread too close to Phisor Lran, but escaped their terrible fate by transforming into a fish. However, whether it be with fang and claw or with hook, line, and sinker, fate has a way of catching those who run from it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black Jet

Said to be stained black by the blood of their slain caretakers, these fish swim with a fervor only those who have fled for their lives know. Just three are enough to turn a river's tide─would that they could turn the tide of battle as well.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ondo Sigh

Yearning for the life his people left behind under the tides, an unnamed Ondo submerged his head beneath the ocean surface and gave cry. His silent lament gave form not to countless bubbles, but to a single fish, its size matching the depth of the Ondo's longing. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Galadion Goby

Sail to any part of the high seas and it is almost a given that some species of goby is swimming under the deck, and Galadion waters are no exception. A discerning eye will see that this particular goby has a somewhat wider dorsal fin than its counterpart found in the Strait of Merlthor. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Galadion Chovy

While at first glance this anchovy may appear no different from those found in the waters of Limsa Lominsa, one sip of the broth made from its bones will compel even the most captious eater to return to Galadion Bay time and again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
La Noscean Jelly

The Seventh Umbral Calamity brought violent upheavals to Eorzea's flora and fauna, not the least of which was an explosion of La Noscea's jellyfish population. The fact that they nearly choke the shores of the region is made only slightly bearable by their relatively harmless sting.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ghoul Barracuda

This barracuda feasts on the flesh of dead fish, leading those who have spied the act to give it the moniker of “ghoul.” However, unlike its namesake, the fish poses little threat to the living, whether they be fish or man.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leopard Eel

Perhaps because there are too many in the sea to give a unique name to, it is not uncommon for a fish to be called after something on land to which it bears a strong resemblance. Or, in this case, after something to which it bears a scant resemblance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunfly

Schools of these fish are often referred to as swimming flower beds, so named for their vibrant scales and flower petal shape. A decidedly bashful aquatic flower, some might say, for few have ever had the pleasure of beholding their beauty up close.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhotano Wahoo

A razor-fanged fish known to swim in the waters of the Rhotano Sea. Unlike its sister fish found in the Sea of Ash, the Rhotano wahoo has had little choice but to prey upon poisonous fish. Over time, those that survive eventually develop mildly poisonous properties themselves. A trait that can prove fatal to the alchemist who cannot discern between these two otherwise identical siblings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rhotano Sardine

A common and otherwise uninteresting fish whose only redeeming qualities are that it is edible and travels in giant schools. Because they can be caught in such large quantities, beggars are quick to choose this inexpensive fish for a meal that's easy on both their stomach and coinpurse.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Plaice

Normally found inhabiting relatively shallow seafloors, this species is said to be seen in waters as deep as 200 yalms. Researchers speculate a proliferation of these fish in recent years has forced them to seek deeper waters where they can more freely feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Floefish

A euryhaline fish that has long since migrated from the frozen waters of Coerthas to the Strait of Merlthor. The warm waters and abundance of food to be found there are said to be why they are able to grow so much larger than their Coerthan kin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Megasquid

Ships that should have the misfortune of encountering this monstrous cephalopod will soon find their keel snapped in twain, then drawn in to the beast's razor-beaked maw, never to be seen again. Or so claimed a captain found clinging to a reef in the northern Strait of Merlthor. Some say the smell of ale on his breath gave the lie to his tale, but any seaman worth their sea salt treads those waters with caution all the same.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oschon's Stone

If the legends are true, this fish came to be when Oschon, god of wanderers and vagrants, cast a stone into the ocean which then gained sentience. Despite this and the passage of countless centuries, however, the stone has somehow yet to realize it has become a fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jasperhead

Easily identified by their nuchal hump, jasperheads are highly prized for the unique, calcified stones formed in their bellies, said to match even the most opulent of jewels in color and beauty. The naturalist who named this fish denies all accusations that its nomenclature is at all related to his feud with an ex-colleague.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarnished Shark

A distant relative of the silver shark, its tarnished, dark grey skin is attributed to the warmer climate of its home near Galadion Bay.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rosy Bream

The rosy bream is known to have the shortest spawning season of any species of Bianaq bream, and some say it is for this reason their scales boast the richest colors. Even their eggs are an unusually vivid shade of crimson, leading many to believe theirs are the most nutritious and therefore worthy of a steeper price at market.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marine Bomb

Whether it be because of some long-forgotten affront to their honor or because they collectively forgot their natural shape, no specimen of this blowfish has ever been caught in a deflated state. Although one has never been observed exploding, fishers have given it this moniker in the fear that one day some poor soul might end up with a face full of spines.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tripod Fish

The sturdy fins of this fish maintain their firmness even bells after they have been wrested from the seas. In fact, by measuring the distance of each fin from the other, many say you can form a triangle whose proportions are as precise as any an arcanist could devise.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Momora Mora

Even a personage as exalted as the Sultan can be the object of ridicule, as observed in ages past when one of Ul'dah's monarchs mistook the name of a Lalafellin noblewoman. The sultan's detractors wasted no time in naming this fish after his gaffe, although there is much debate as to whose reputation was more damaged by this courtly intrigue─the sultan's, the woman's, or the fish's.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Monkfish

Inhabiting the turbulent currents of the Rhotano Sea, the dull crimson of this fish's scales is made even more menacing when the proboscis upon its head shines red. Many a treasure-seeking fisher has been drawn in by its ruby glow, but few have returned with anything save open wounds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Chrome Hammerhead

To many this shark may look much like the one endemic to the Strait of Merlthor, with its protruding eyes and oddly shaped head. Those familiar with the more obscure aspects of these seaborne predators, however, will note that its skin is a darker shade of black, likely due to the unique organisms present in the waters it inhabits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ogre Eel

Insatiable in its appetites, this species of eel tends to be fattier than the varieties found in other parts of Eorzea. If they knew what people on land were calling them, perhaps they would save some of the ocean's prey for the other hungry fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tossed Dagger

In contrast to the soaring arcs of its brethren in other parts of the ocean, this fish leaps through the Strait of Merlthor in short, cutting crescents. However, unlike its namesake, two sailors can toss it back and forth for bells and still have all their extremities intact at the end.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaggy Seadragon

This fish is often dragged out of the ocean along with the morass of seaweed in which it makes its home. The tangled algae is also its main source of sustenance, resulting in short periods of time in which it must swim through dangerous waters bereft of home or nourishment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Net Crawler

The first fishers that spied this wavekin in their nets were astounded by its massive size, but their enthusiasm was soon dampened when they discovered that it had little in the way of edible meat. Although scant, its flavor was appetizing, and culinarians that know how to get the most out of each crab have become prized commodities in Limsa Lominsa.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyan Octopus

Historians debate the series of events that led to the discovery of the deep blue this octopus's ink produces, but most agree that it likely involved an angry cephalopod. Regardless, the results of the incident are well documented: dresses dyed with this ink became so in vogue that merchants were forced to produce imitations as the wavekin's population plummeted.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavenswimmer

Before the Seventh Umbral Calamity, the Heavenswimmer was never seen in Eorzean waters. However, the destruction wrought that fateful day would bring great change to the ocean's currents, altering the migration patterns of many a fish. It is for that reason the Heavenswimmer can, on occasion, be found swimming the waters of Galadion Bay.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Merlthor Butterfly

Sought after for display in aquariums, demand soared to perilous heights when word spread that Gegeruju would pay handsomely for a Merlthor butterfly. Hearing this, fishers all but threw themselves into the Strait of Merlthor, driving this fish to the brink of extinction. In the end, he would have his prize, but at a far greater cost than he realized.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gladius

Named for its long and perilously sharp bill, many an unsuspecting fisher has found themself a ruin of cuts and gashes when attempting to reel in this predatory beast. (The inherent risk of bringing a fishing hook to a sword fight.)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Nautilus

This mollusk is able to absorb and process aether through its gills in such a way that it may forgo eating for days at a time─weeks if necessary. A remarkable trait researchers have been eager to incorporate into submarine propulsion systems.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lampfish

A diminutive fish whose size belies its prodigious spawn. Indeed, so plentiful are its eggs that a single fish can produce a near-inexhaustible supply of roe. All the better for merchants who ply this delectable product to the realm's affluent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Merlthor Lobster

A large lobster found in the crisp cold waters of the northern Strait of Merlthor. They are considered a delicacy among the rich and well-to-do of Eorzea, so much so that no banquet can be considered a success without at least one platter of these succulent lobsters on hand.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Elder Dinichthys

A wise man once said that it is best to be both loved and feared in equal measure─and that is the case for most of the dinichthys with respect to their Sahagin worshipers. This particular specimen, however, is too old, too powerful, and frankly, too tired to bother with all of that, demanding subservience through the sheer amount of terror it inspires.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Drunkfish

It is said that love is the primary nature of the Twelve, but that was not so when a blasphemous drunkard fell into Galadion Bay. He was cursed to live as a fish with a head retaining his own ale-sodden face. Rather than hide his shame, the drunkfish is known to lure sailors into the water, swimming to the surface knowing full well they will mistake him for a crewmate fallen overboard.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Leviathan

A fish recently discovered in the waters of the southern Strait of Merlthor, named for its resemblance to the Lord of the Whorl. Much like other fish with legendary namesakes, the little Leviathan is anything but small.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabaton

Kin to the armorer, the singular foot of this shellbound wavekin is protected with nigh-impregnable scales. The naturalist who discovered it did not hesitate in choosing a name befitting its resilience.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shooting Star

These fish were once a common sight in Eorzean waters, but are now on the brink of extinction in the wake of the Seventh Umbral Calamity. Originally named by the Sahagin, their scarcity now lends itself to this moniker now widely used in the fishing community.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Merman's Mane

The merman's mane is wont to appear mainly at night, the sight of it often likened to a man─or at least, the head of a man─amidst the waves. It is said to spy this wavekin on your journey is an ill omen, though none have lived to tell if their luck did indeed take a turn for the worse.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavenskey

Often avoided due to its potent poisonous properties, this fish is considered a rare delicacy for the man with nothing to lose. There is no questioning that one will die after even a mouthful. However, rumor has it that the heavenskey, as its name suggests, may save wayward souls intended for any one of the seven hells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ghost Shark

Noting the haunting glow of its remains─a result of the fish's innate ability to store vast quantities of aether in its body that had yet to disperse─the two naturalists who first discovered this wavekin were at odds as to what to name it. One insisted it be named a phantom shark, the other a specter shark. After much feuding they came to a compromise, and thus it would be called the ghost shark.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Quicksilver Blade

For centuries this wavekin was thought to be the stuff of legends, but recent encounters have shown it to be both very real and quite lethal. Speculation amongst anglers traces its name to accounts of a monster born of alchemy─an abomination of living liquid let loose by careless keepers to stalk the waters of Galadion Bay. Regardless, the danger of the creature itself remains cold, hard fact.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigator's Print

Llymlaen, watcher of the seas and guardian of Limsa Lominsa. A benevolent god, and perhaps a clumsy one if certain legends are to be believed. It is said She is able to restore life to Her children of the sea─a skill She was quick to learn after stepping on said children one too many times, leaving peculiar fish-shaped footprints in Her wake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Casket Oyster

Like any casket worth opening, the mollusk locked firmly within this shell is said to be simply to die for. Their valves are often fused to large rocks on the seabed, however, making the task of their harvest quite difficult. Captains often keep caskets of a different sort at the ready in case of emergency.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fishmonger

Like its goosefish brethren, the fishmonger is a rapacious eater, and certainly not a particular one. Cutting a fishmonger open, one will find the remains of other fish, sharks, mollusks, the occasional Lalafell─a veritable fisher's market of the southern seas.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mythril Sovereign

An elusive fish known to travel the seas along spectral currents. The faint glow of their scales from absorbing the currents' aether makes them a spectacular catch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nimble Dancer

The nimble dancer is known not only for the beautiful hues of its scales, but also its elongated fins that seem to dance effortlessly on the ocean's currents. Some fishers liken the rhythmic motion of its fins to the traditional dances of Radz–at–Han.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sea Nettle

Veteran seafarers all recall the first time they mistook the golden bell of this jellyfish for jettisoned plunder, and getting stung by one is a rite of passage for many. Luckily the poison is a mere annoyance, causing an itch that persists for days, but nothing more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Grandmarlin

This wavekin bears the scars of countless hooks and spears that missed their mark. Perhaps content that it had achieved victory over the most hardened seamen, it offered up little resistance when it found itself at the end of a fishing hook one fateful day. That fisher may have caught one of the most cantankerous fish the high seas have ever known, but did they really deserve the honor?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shipwreck's Sail

A common story heard in the taverns of port towns is one in which a helmsman spots the sail of a wrecked ship on the horizon. Whether driven by greed or compassion, the captain then orders the crew to change course to the direction of the sighting. However, not several malms from their destination, all eyes lose sight of the sail, and any ship it may have been part of.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Charlatan Survivor

Pretender to the throne, a mere shadow of the light it apes, dissembler of the highest order, and soulless charlatan─this wavekin has been called all that and more besides. However, the vitriol fails to penetrate the helmet's shell, and so the impostor sleeps, content inside its ill-begotten plunder.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi-aetherlouse

Some sailors doubt the existence of the so-called “spectral currents,” but one look at this wavekin is enough to set their misgivings to rest for good. It is also enough to set their minds racing with images of finding such an abomination on the decks of their ships─or worse, under their bedcovers.   


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Azeyma's Sleeve

Its beautiful trailing fins are said to conjure images of the sun goddess's flowing robes. Catching one is believed to bring great fortune, provided that it is immediately returned to the waves. Failure to do so will conversely result in the angler and seven generations of their offspring being horribly cursed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aetheric Seadragon

Though its unusual frond-like fins were originally a means of camouflage, they grew larger over time and are now used to threaten those that intrude on its territory. While this may prove effective against smaller wavekin, larger predators will not hesitate to gobble it up, impressive fins or no.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coral Seadragon

Its cunning disguise as a piece of inanimate coral is perfectly complemented by its natural tendency to remain perfectly still unless absolutely necessary. This is, however, credited to sheer laziness rather than an innate desire to survive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Roguesaurus

Taking its name from the Rogue River, fossil remains indicate that it was once a land-dwelling scalekin that returned to the water. The other inhabitants of the Rogue River were, by all accounts, rather unhappy with this arrangement, as it proceeded to steal the top position on the food chain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aronnax

Possesses incredible speed, though unfortunately only when swimming backwards. This oceanic oddity wishes it had eyes in the back of its head.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweeper

Unlike its close cousin, the ferocious hammerhead, this particular species is content to forgo larger prey in favor of scouring the ocean floor for smaller morsels. Given the methodical manner in which it feeds, many believe it is merely trying to keep its habitat free from detritus.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silencer

Due to the potent-yet-nonlethal poison that courses through its body, those who dine upon its delectable meat find their throats close up after the meal, rendering them unable to speak for several bells. Even served surreptitiously to those who are due to give testimony, making it a popular purchase among the criminal element of Limsa Lominsa.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep-sea Eel

Some fishers claim that the “deep” part of its name in fact refers to its profound understanding of the greater workings of the universe, rather than the depth at which it swims.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Executioner

Rumor has it that one member of this particular species once carved a large hole in the hull of a pirate ship, and thereby drowning all on board. Fishers often go to great lengths to hunt these wavekin, not for their meat, but to stop them before they can cause significant damage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wild Urchin

The first person to look at one of these bizarre creatures and think, “I'm going to eat that,” must surely not have been of sound mind. Yet their blatant disregard for its multitude of spines was rewarded, and they found that the insides were not only creamy and flavorsome, but edible. One cannot help but wonder how many other unpleasant ocean-dwellers were sampled prior to making this unlikely discovery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
True Barramundi

This wavekin's natural defense is its size; it is simply too large for most other wavekin to fit into their mouths. Other than that, it relies on its sheer ordinariness to remain unnoticed by those predators with the means to make a meal of this docile drifter. Docile, that is, until it catches sight of Lalafell, which are believed to be its favorite snack.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prodigal Son

Despite having grown to a far larger size than considered necessary for his kind, he continues to roam the waters of the world in search of what a fish would consider a good time, rather than return to his spawning grounds to produce offspring. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Slipsnail

Though it may appear defenseless at first glance, its soft, scaleless body conceals a row of aether-imbued spines to spear the mouths of those who would feed upon it. Unfortunately, this form of protection does rely on already being inside the predator's mouth to be effective, which comes as too little, too late in most cases.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hammerclaw

In addition to being able to crush shell and bone, its pincers can also be used to club its prey into submission. Its only shortcoming is its inability to swim, as it is capable of little more than bobbing up and down clumsily like a floating shoe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coccosteus

Held in great esteem by the Sahagin, whose legends tell of a great wavekin borne on silvery waves that granted them divine knowledge and the secrets of the harpoon. In reality, however, this beast of the deep is far less benevolent, as those unfortunate enough to encounter one normally end up with less than the standard number of fingers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bartholomew the Chopper

Clad in thick chitin plates and armed with razor-sharp pincers, this vicious wavekin makes sport of many weaker ocean-dwellers, seemingly murdering them for its own amusement. It is rumored that it also has a more genial side, if one is prepared to overlook the fact it is practically an aquatic serial killer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prowler

In spite of its rather fearsome name, the leisurely pace with which it gently paddles through the water is more akin to strolling than prowling. Some theories suggest that the name was invented by fishers to make the minor feat of catching one sound more impressive than it actually is.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mopbeard

Beneath the waves, there are few sights more astonishing than one of these graceful wavekin in motion, its elegant membranes resembling a flowing ballroom dress. Far less breathtaking is its appearance when raised out of the water on an angler's line, where its appearance is something akin to an innkeeper's mop, hence the name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Floating Saucer

When viewed from a distance, could be mistaken for an upturned porcelain saucer. Even when observed from close proximity, the faint pattern even resembles the remnants of a picture rendered in gold leaf.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gugrusaurus

Known to possess a certain low cunning, and has been reported to ram smaller craft in the hopes of knocking the occupants overboard. Lalafells are particularly vulnerable to such attacks and it is advised that they tie a rope around their waist to avoid becoming this wavekin's luncheon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Funnel Shark

Said to be a distant relation of the basking shark that inhabits the Sea of Clouds. However, rather than being content to feast only on plankton like its more docile cousin, it will gladly swallow anything it can fit in its gaping maw. A chocobo saddle was found in the belly of one caught off the shores of Aleport, though the fate of the bird to which it was once attached remains a mystery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fallen One

Seldom seen by fishers due to its natural aversion to the more commonly used baits and lures. Its primary means of survival appears to be fleeing from absolutely anything that comes near it. Some believe that many even die from starvation because they are simply too scared to approach the smaller fish on which they are supposed to feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Megalodon

As if being made of pure muscle and armed with rows of razor-sharp teeth was not imposing enough, this apex predator is blessed with an ominous, spectral glow. It seems unconcerned by the fact this alerts prey of its approach, as attempts to flee are almost guaranteed to end in failure. Perhaps this is nature's way of giving its next meal a sporting chance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Discus

While being bathed in aether may serve to benefit some varieties of wavekin, this poor specimen has been rendered vulnerable to predation due to its increased visibility. Some anglers, however, view its bizarre coloration with suspicion, and steer clear to avoid the possibility of poisoning. After all, how many of the foods consumed by land-dwellers are a luminous blue?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Sea Bo

Although most sea-anythings fail to live up to their land-based namesakes, an ethereal blue glow can do wonders for one's standing among wavekin. It may not have much in the way of natural defenses, but the air of confidence this sea bo exudes will make many think twice before challenging it to a race.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Bass

Although bass are far from the most beautiful of fish, this particular variety is highly sought by collectors for its mysterious azure aura. Many are disappointed to find that this quickly dissipates after the fish expires, and it is better suited to being kept in an aquarium than to being stuffed and mounted.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sothis

This ancient species of turtle has, for reasons unknown, come to have brilliantly glowing crystal fused with its shell. Those traversing the seas at night have reported seeing their light shining from beneath the waves, earning them the appellation “Star of the Deep.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coral Manta

So slow-moving and docile are these wavekin that they often become home to several varieties of coral. These complex miniature ecosystems include creatures that spend their entire lives on the back of one of these gentle giants, many of which are edible. As such, a veritable seafood smorgasbord can result from a single catch, if one has the strength to reel it in.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stonescale

Despite being at the very top of the food chain, this formidable species has nigh-impenetrable natural defenses. They are said to be rockfins that have lived for so long that the stony covering has spread to envelop their entire body. Should the adage, “There is always a bigger fish,” actually prove true, said bigger fish would no doubt struggle to feast on such an obviously inedible creature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Elasmosaurus

Once thought to be extinct, legends tell of this enormous creature being used to tow pirate ships in the seas around Aerslaent. They are said to form close bonds with those worthy of their respect, even going so far as to sacrifice themselves for the good of their masters.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thinker's Coral

In light of its origin, perhaps it is unsurprising that this coral is thought to be imbued with Thaliak's wisdom. Many even believe that giving a chunk of it a good lick will grant the taster a flash of inspiration─a practice that is both highly frowned upon and widely perpetuated in scholarly circles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragonspine

Though these mollusks may simply fancy dragon bone for its defensive properties, Coerthan folklore has it that their flesh arose from within it, and that they are themselves, in some sense, bone given new life. Indeed, the influence of lingering wyrm aether would explain their overall lethality...though not their predisposition toward cannibalism.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Crab

This wavekin's blue carapace turns a pale rose hue when heat is applied to it; a common sight in the taverns of Wright, where the cast-off shells of growing crabs are fried whole and served with a draught of ale. One crab's trash is a hungry man's pleasure.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuchsia Bloom

This fish is said to have come into being when a pixie, having grown tired of playing princess, dropped a wreath of flower petals into a nearby pond. Any who have seen a school of these wavekin up close will attest that the legend must be true, for the vibrancy of their coloring rivals that of any flower bed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sinsteeped

During spawning season, this wavekin becomes enveloped in milky eggs. A small panic was caused when a citizen of the Crystarium mistook a pregnant fish for a waterborne sin eater, and although the mistake was soon realized, the incident earned the creature this ominous moniker forevermore.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sweetheart

The encroachment of man-eating wavekin tends to cause a frenzy that does more harm than good. In an effort to stem the panic, the soldiers who first discovered these beasts gave them a nickname that belied their cruel nature. Irony is often lost on the general populace, however, and it is unclear how many naive souls have made the mistake of taking the name literally.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant Taimen

The skin of the taimen is known for its durability, and has long been used to make a peculiar form of leather. This particular variety of the wavekin is much larger than the common species, making its by-products well suited for ropes and other materials that bear heavy weights.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leannisg

This wavekin's name means “wide fish” in the language of the pixies. While it sounds pleasant to the ears of those unfamiliar with that fey tongue, none have thought to ask the creatures themselves what they think of the appellation's poeticism.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gold Hammer

After surviving countless duels to the death against other, bigger lobsters, this wavekin emerged victorious atop a mountain of severed claws, only to finally end up on your fishing hook. Its claws snap open and closed, recounting their brutal struggles, but to you it only conjures up the image of a goldsmith delicately taking measures for her next project.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Recordkiller

The Viis tell stories of ravenous catfish that lurk just below the surface of shallow lakes, lying in wait until a creature is foolish enough to slake its thirst. For all their wisdom, many a Qitari would fall prey to this trick, and get dragged into the depths along with their accumulated knowledge. That the Viis named this wavekin thusly may indicate which of those losses they viewed to be more egregious. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mother of All Pancakes

None know exactly how the first culinarian to make pancakes was inspired, but many have surmised that this wavekin may have provided at least the initial spark. Delicious as it may look from the outside, any who are unfortunate enough to be drawn in by its innocuous exterior will soon be met with rows of razor-sharp teeth before being smothered in the cephalopod's embrace.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Opal Shrimp

This wavekin's beauty is rivaled only by its wrath. The Ondo have long prized its shell, but caution their younglings with the tale of a cadre of brave warriors who set out to procure one for their queen. They eventually returned with their prize, but five fewer in number and unwilling to speak about their experience, leaving each subsequent storyteller to fill in the grisly details.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hoplite

While the metallic shell of this wavekin offers protection from aquatic predators, it proved ineffective against the ingenuity of fishers, who found a market for the rigid material among those who require protection from terrestrial dangers. The sight of it floating just under the water's surface evokes the image of Halone's shield, but divinity only commands so much respect in the face of profit.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hook Fish

The bones of this wavekin are uncommonly sturdy and sharp, which led to them being used as hooks by the fishers of the Ruby Sea. Legends abound of the first angler whose mettle was a match for this fish, and each ship captain insists that their version of the tale is the truth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloudweed

Despite how unappetizing this weed may appear at a glance, enterprising souls have discovered that once it is dried and ground into a fine seasoning, it brings out the flavor of almost any meal. Animals have taken a liking to it as well, and a sprinkling of it in a bucket of feed will have them devouring even the most unpalatable mixture.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fatty Herring

Fans of dishes made with this meaty fish will swear that it is more savory than beef or mutton. The trick to catching them is to aim for the fastest specimens, for they are always the most well-fed among their schools, reaching prodigious sizes by virtue of always being the first served.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Inkshell

The ink sacs of this bivalve mollusk have long been favored for the vibrant colors of the prints they produce. Other parts of the wavekin have been used for less scrupulous purposes; the pearls in particular are sold as counterfeit linkpearls, and many have been left mumbling into an inert mineral, wondering why their allies have abandoned them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Petal Shell

Aptly named for their resemblance to plum blossom petals, these vividly colored bivalves have long been used not only for decoration, but also in the construction of various tools.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Allagan Hunter

An exotic fish best known for its glimmering gold scales, though they are often marred with the blood of their kin. Combative by nature, Allagan hunters are known to devour one another, and this cannibalistic behavior is said to be the source of their scales' resilience and lustrous sheen.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moonlight Guppy

Outshining even its lesser cousin, the platinum guppy, this scintillating freshwater beauty is also said to have been named by the Crystal Exarch. How he knew to compare it to the light of an unseen moon has, in certain circles, been the subject of some debate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Steel Fan

Records state that the lord of Eulmore was once presented with a fan of metallic jade sheen, which, after a brief moment's disdainful appraisal, he promptly flung over the balcony and into the sea. Had that discarded treasure suddenly rippled and swam away, it would have greatly resembled this shimmering wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Henodus Grandis

This primordial species of turtle grows to impressive size, its bulk protected by an iron-hard shell. Kholusian warriors once fashioned its natural armor into shields, and these relics of a bygone era can still be unearthed from sites scattered across the island.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunken Tome

Certain of the blotchy patterns upon this fish's scales appear to be lettering, distorted as if drawn in watery ink. One story claims the freshwater denizen was once the tome of a royal archivist who, fleeing from a sin eater, dropped it into a mountain stream, with the book assuming its current form in some arcane act of self-preservation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pearl Pipira

Sheathed in lustrous scales of shining pearl, this entrancing specimen has a taste for flesh. Anyone foolish enough to wade into its territory will soon feel needle-sharp teeth sinking into a leg, the bite deep enough to expose bone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ondotaker

True to its name, this savage deep-sea predator has claimed the lives of many an Ondo warrior seeking the glory of battle. The crimson cloud left drifting in its wake marks the end of countless tales of terror.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tortoiseshell Crab

The carapace of this crab is unusually thick and durable, as if it had, indeed, traded shells with an amenable, hard-backed reptile. Such natural defenses, however, avail it little against a sudden influx of crab boats, seeking to capitalize on the growing demand for this Cieldalaes delicacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lady's Cameo

So beautiful did folk find the silvery spiral of this conch that they likened it to a shimmering jewel─specifically the priceless one which slipped through the careless fingers of Princess Edvya and bounced into the ocean as she skipped across the deck of the royal galleon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Metallic Boxfish

This species of fugu puffs itself up into a shape that resembles nothing more than a five-sided box. Coastal villagers in the Cieldalaes are known to craft beautiful and surprisingly sturdy containers from the reflective wavekin's dried remains.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thaliak Crab

Although technically a type of river crab, this crustacean spends its larval stage in the sea. Once grown, it crawls up to dwell in the waters of the Thaliak, only to return to the ocean again and again in order to spawn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Star of the Destroyer

Some say that when the burning fragments of Rhalgr's beacon plunged into the ocean, the life which pulsed within them could not be extinguished. On moonlit nights they float upon the surface, the star-studded waters becoming as a mirror to the twinkling sky above.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
True Scad

Similar in appearance to the false scad, dissections have nonetheless shown this wavekin's internal anatomy is more closely related to an actual scad. Yet despite being turned literally inside out, the truth of this fish's taxonomy remains the subject of endless─and often petty─dispute.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crow Puffer

The dark half of this blowfish is no empty metaphor─the deeper the pigment, the more densely packed its prickly spines. Individuals boasting the most tenebrous hues have been observed receiving preferential treatment within their shoals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rothlyt Kelp

Though closely related to its elongated cousin, the malm kelp, this Rothlyt Sound native is known more for the plumpness of its fronds than any extraordinary length. Some seaweed connoisseurs, however, express a preference for thickness.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Living Lantern

The soft, seemingly candlelit glow of this jellyfish has entranced the gaze of many a seafarer, bringing a sense of safety and contentment. As such, finding a living lantern in one's nets is considered an omen of good fortune amongst the fisherfolk of the Rothlyt Sound.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goobbue Ray

Most assume this manta was so named for its great width and distinctive coloring, but some choose to believe the rather more whimsical tale of its origin─that a pack of goobbues, wading in the shallows, grew so enamored of the ocean that they assumed forms which would let them frolic in the waves forevermore.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Watermoura

With its great fins spread wide, this wavekin flits through the water like...well, one might say a butterfly were it a prettier fish, but as things stand, it puts folk more in mind of a moth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
King Cobrafish

Once it has impaled a victim with its long, venom-filled fangs, this underwater potentate will then coil around its hapless prey and settle down for a royal feast. Hail to the king.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blooded Wrasse

This species of wrasse does, in fact, owe its name to the Bloodbrine Sea in which it dwells. It was merely a happy coincidence that the habit these wavekin have of smashing their lumpy heads together often gives them a scarlet-stained appearance. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloodpolish Crab

Legend has it that these were once simple blue crabs, which, upon beholding the painted nails of well-groomed merfolk, were consumed with irrational envy. According to their tiny crab brains, a similar effect could be achieved by keeping their claws drenched in blood.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blue Stitcher

There is a tale passed down from generation to generation that tells of Llymlaen using the spindly, needle-like limbs of this wavekin to weave a fishing net malms and malms across. As such, its semblance traditionally signifies a big haul of fish amongst the coastal communities of the Bloodbrine.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Honeycomb Fish

The pattern on this wavekin's scales creates the illusion of a small rock honeycombed with holes. When tiny fish swim near, seeking refuge in these “hollows,” they instead find themselves trapped inside a toothy cavern. Momentarily, at least.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Godsbed

The staggering size of these mollusks has fired the imagination of artists since the dawn of man. One particularly famous rendering has led to countless second-rate attempts to depict some muscled sea-god or scantily clad mermaid reclining upon the ocean's own bivalve bed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lansquenet

This wavekin is known for roaming great distances on the ocean's currents, often attaching itself to schools of smaller fish in the role of temporary guardian. Such behavior gives the impression of a mercenary protecting a band of travelers, but it is rarely─if ever─paid for its services.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mamahi-mahi

Though few in number these days, this species of wavekin gave rise to every variant of mahi-mahi which now populate the expanse of the southern seas. Contrary to common belief, the origin of its name has absolutely no relation to any Lalafell, living or dead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lavandin Remora

A subspecies of lavender remora common to the waters off the coast of La Noscea. The result of crossbreeding with other, closely related wavekin, this remora variant owes its name to a hybrid of the lavender plant.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloodfresh Tuna

This wide-ranging ocean fish is hauled in from the coastal waters of the north seas. When freshly carved, its fillets are praised for their bright, bloody hue and delectable flavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunken Mask

It is likely that this goblin mask drifted down the Thaliak and was swept out to sea. It is unlikely that the goblin who wore it is happy about the situation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thavnairian Shark

Preferring the warm embrace of more temperate waters, this shark will follow the seasonal currents over vast distances when it comes time to breed. Among Thavnairian fisherfolk, it is known as a symbol of fertility and a reminder of the changing seasons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nephrite Eel

This juvenile stage of the jade eel is most often found in open sea, where the prey is plentiful. Naturalists have observed that as the nephrite matures, its body darkens to the adult's lustrous green, but beyond this, little is certain of its life cycle or breeding habits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cieldalaes Geode

In contrast to its dull, rubble-like exterior, the inside of this wavekin's maw rivals the rainbow beauty of a crystal prism. Those braving a closer look should also be prepared to admire its razor-sharp teeth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bareface

This species of octopus is easily recognized by its round eyes and droopy earlike flaps. One goblin fisher was heard to remark on its passing resemblance to a drunken companion who, it seems, had removed his face covering to vomit into a rock pool.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ginkgo Fin

When a school of these emerald-finned wavekin dive and dart in concert, one might almost believe a tree dense with fan-shaped leaves had taken to swimming in the ocean.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Titanshell Crab

This crab is prized for the cloud-soft whiteness and delicacy of its meat. Unscrupulous fishmongers are known to boil cheaper specimens to simulate the crimson hue of its carapace, but a canny customer always checks the thickness of the shell.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mythril Boxfish

The metallic sheen of this fish's scales has been intensified by an inundation of aether. Fisherfolk will sometimes fashion its remains into a box in truth, the containers favored for carrying hooks, pretty seashells, and other such valuables.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mistbeard's Cup

A legendary pirate needs a legendary vessel, and not just the sailing kind. Tavern keepers claim that Mistbeard would come in with the shell of a gargantuan nautiloid, and ask to fill it with a barrel's worth of grog.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Anomalocaris Saron

Propelling itself through the water with sinuous undulations, this primitive wavekin falls upon its prey with surprising swiftness. Its similarities to the anomalocaris in the Sea of Clouds suggest an evolutionary divergence in the distant past.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flaming Eel

Should it be exposed to fire, this oily eel will burn quite readily, the flaming pattern on its skin soon replaced by actual flames. It is prized among seafarers as a substitute fuel for cooking, and for the surfeit of fish oil which can be extracted from its flesh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jetborne Manta

The tremendous speed at which this manta glides along can only be explained by arcane enhancement. The prevailing theory suggests some manner of adaptation in its gills which allows the wavekin to convert the aetherial current into a preternatural propulsive force.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Devil's Sting

Sailors speak grimly of a devilish fish which rides the spectral current. They claim this wavekin takes a dark delight in chasing down and impaling prey with its highly toxic spines, only to wait and watch as its victim writhes in protracted agony.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Callichthyid

A species of catfish armored in rows of bony plates. Territorial rivals will ram each other with shocking ferocity, the victor decided when the osseous scales of the weaker specimen crack and break away.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Meandering Mora

This enormously rotund variety of sunfish does not swim so much as allow itself to be swept along. Meetings between potential mates occur only at the whim of the currents, leading many to wonder how the species has not already drifted into extinction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oracular Crab

A particularly large variant of the bloodpolish crab said to appear with the spectral current. Its habit of cramming the shredded pieces of prey into a chosen hollow has been interpreted by some as a ritual offering to the all-seeing spirits of the deep.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dravanian Bream

Sufficiently mature bream will venture into the sea for a period of time, before eventually returning to the mountain rivers in which they were spawned. Those caressed by the spectral currents end their sojourn stained a deep shade of cinnabar.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Skaldminni

“Strummed he upon a lonely rock, 'midst seas of blood and brine. A poet's love for wind and wave did weave through ev'ry line. Into the surf he cast his lute, a soul too deep bestirred. And lo, beneath the salty foam, his song can yet be heard.” - The Saga of the Skaldminni.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Serrated Clam

Haunted by the fanged clams of Coerthas, a man dreamed the mollusks had migrated to the ocean and developed an insatiable urge to crush all living things betwixt their serrated shells. Some nightmares can be so realistic...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Beatific Vision

A priestfish that has discovered a higher calling. This wavekin has swum in the aether-rich waters of the divine, enrapturing its flock with the deific luminescence of its lure.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Exterminator

Armed with heavy pincers and a voracious appetite, this crab is rightly feared by the other denizens of the spectral current for its relentless enthusiasm in dismembering and devouring still-living prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gory Tuna

Any tuna that can survive and flourish in the cruelest of the Bloodbrine's currents is a rarity to be treasured─a notion reflected in the steep price one of these exceptional specimens commands when brought to auction in the fish markets.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ticinepomis

This primitive species of coelacanth coasts through its territory with brazen deliberation, secure in its place at the top of the food chain. Though its pace is leisurely, fish are often tumbled head over tail by the powerful current created by its passage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Quartz Hammerhead

An overlong stint in the aetherial blue has altered this wavekin's distinctive head into a semi-crystalline state. By peering into its pale, translucent depths, one can observe the pulsing strands of the creature's nervous system.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garum Jug

Pufferfish are often dried and crafted into some manner of serviceable container─in this case, a jug for holding fish sauce. The wavekin itself produces a defensive liquid much like a squid, which is said to have a flavor similar to the fermented condiment stored in its remains.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Smooth Jaguar

From the patterning on its scales, to the agile twists and turns it makes as it chases down its prey, this underwater hunter is eerily similar to its land-based namesake. Just squint a bit, and you'll see it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rothlyt Mussel

Prized for their succulent, orange flesh, these bivalve mollusks also fetch a hefty purse from jewelers, who work the shimmering, nacreous layers of the shells into magnificent trinkets.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Levi Elver

These large eels are held sacred by the Sahagin, who believe them to be the children of Leviathan. The same eels are quietly eaten by Rothlyt Sound sailors, who believe them to be delicious (and auspicious for safe voyages).


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pearl Bombfish

While it floats in the aether-dense waters of the spectral current, the spine-covered belly of this balloonfish glimmers like mother-of-pearl. A return to more mundane seas, however, soon sees that glorious radiance fade to a sickly shade of beige.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Trollfish

Solitary, unsightly, and extremely hostile. Do not approach unless you enjoy being whipped to within an ilm of your life by a cranial crest that hits like a steel war fan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Panoptes

The plethora of white spots on this ray's back appear as a host of unblinking eyes─an illusion so beguiling that superstitious sailors once spread rumors of a ghostly, aquatic voidsent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crepe Sole

A royal servant once remarked that this fish was astonishingly similar to an item of footwear, specifically a delicate sandal inadvertently kicked into the ocean by an overly excited sultan of Ul'dah.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Knifejaw

Eschewing the tedious task of prying barnacles from coral rock, this iron-beaked specimen simply bites down and grinds up entire mouthfuls of gritty matter. Its fangs are said to be as sharp as honed blades, alike in composition to tempered steel.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Butterfly

Does the swishing of this aquatic butterfly's fins summon an aetheric storm in Sharlayan? Whatever the cause─or effect─of its crystalline form, none can question its haunting beauty.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Eel

Mistaking its azure glow for a shocking aura, a determined naturalist took hold of one of these eels with a rubber-lined glove. As it happens, she should have been more wary of its teeth in her leg.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectresaur

As if a hulking scalekin with a fang-filled maw wasn't terrifying enough, this spectral harbinger appears to be warped by a surfeit of aetheric power.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafgufa

Thought to be a scion of the abomination which dwells beneath Hullbreaker Isle, this betentacled fiend harbors a hatred of Lominsans, seeming to seek out and entangle their vessels with single-minded purpose.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seafaring Toad

To all intents and purposes, this appears to be an ordinary toad...swimming in the middle of the ocean. One wonders if life on the high seas was more preferable to being an experimental subject for the inventive minds of Idyllshire.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Placodus

This scalekin excavates bivalves from the sea floor, before crushing them, shells and all, between its flattened back teeth. The fragmented ruins of hundreds upon hundreds of shellfish litter the shore where it chooses to feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pickled Pom

While it may look as though it would be at home attached to a moogle's head and smell like it has been soaked in vinegar, the question of what it actually is remains unanswered.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flintstrike

This wavekin has developed its glowing orange fins in order to attract a mate. This also has the unwanted side effect of drawing the attention of every predator within a square malm, though this is perhaps a small price to pay to find one's true love.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aster Trivi

This ultramarine starfish takes center stage in Crystarium lessons on the night sky, with educators placing it amongst the lesser asteroidea to represent the brightest celestial bodies. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Python Discus

The mottled, python-like pattern of this fish is prized by artisans of all kinds. Rumor has it that one Eulmoran fop employed as many as fifty fisherfolk to trawl the seas in order to have an entire suit fashioned from the elusive wavekin's scales. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Steel Razor

Cutting vertically through the ocean like the blade it so resembles, this steel-hued wavekin can─once its stiffened husk has been dried and sharpened─be put to actual use as a surprisingly effective razor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadeshifter

So proficient is this wavekin's mimicry that it can live entirely unnoticed in the shadow of other species. Some suspect its ability to preemptively imitate the behavior of other creatures is a limited form of precognition.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nabaath Saw

Eschewing griffins and dragons and other typical icons of might, the Nabaath Areng military based its insignia on the ferocious Nabaath saw. Sneering foes soon learned to respect that symbol, sometimes at the business end of a weapon crafted from said wavekin's lethal dorsal fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dammroen Herring

Near the Church at Dammroen Field grow flowering trees, slender and graceful, and from their fallen fruit hatched these beautiful fish. Or so the tale goes. True or not, most agree that a school of Dammroen herring fry resemble nothing so much as a swirling cloud of delicate fruit blossoms.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Celestial

Once upon a time, these bulbous-eyed wavekin swam in the palace ponds, the jealously guarded treasures of the royal house of Voeburt. Relegated now to some obscure waterway, one must assume they have long since fallen from majestic favor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deephaunt

Found in the brackish waters which collect in the caverns of Woven Oath, these fish instinctively sink down to the deepest, darkest part of their stygian homes. Over the years, their eyes have devolved into blind orbs, this lack of vision causing them to swim a wandering, erratic course in the search for food.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Pipira

Armed with a paralyzing toxin even more potent than its smaller cousin, this pipira need only dart in and nip its prey once. The bitten victim is robbed of voluntary movement almost immediately, the slight twitching ignored by the voracious wavekin as it feeds on its helpless─and very much still alive─meal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mora Tecta

With a name meaning “hidden” and a hider by nature, the mora tecta avoids predators by sliding its flattened-out body into narrow crevices between rocks or losing itself in dense forests of kelp. For this particular fish, it's survival of the thinnest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maru Crab

This bulky ocean crustacean bears the name of a water deity, the tales of which are passed down in the local lore of the Tempest. Highly sensitive to aetheric disturbances, it is often able to gather its fellows and flee before predators or other dangers arrive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dravanian Scallop

Very little of this oft-overlooked mollusk is actually edible; its colors drab and unsuited for ornamentation. When ground into a powder, however, its shell is highly sought after as an ingredient for various alchemical creations...a fact which likely comes as small solace to the scallop.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud Kelp

Once pulled from the water, the spongy leaves of this kelp can be squeezed to produce a prodigious amount of liquid. The plant is possessed of natural sterilization properties, and any water thus filtered through its fronds is purified of any harmful contaminants.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scarlet Frog

A diet of poisonous mites causes a mild toxin to build up in the secretions of this red-hued frog. It is a simple process to extract the paralytic poison and refine it into a pain-dulling elixir, a practice routinely employed by field chirurgeons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
White Clam

In Far Eastern legend, this eye-catching mollusk is fabled to project its aura as a shimmering mirage above the water. Those who procure such wondrous shells are known to treasure them as incense holders, often gilding the interior with gold or other precious metals. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fragrant Sweetfish

A predilection for feeding on the fragrant grasses which grow along the riverbanks has resulted in a fish so tender and infused with flavor that no additional seasoning is necessary.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Listracanthus

A shark species of primal origin, the serpentine listracanthus glides smoothly through the water, the hair-thin scales upon its back swaying to and fro like an undulating mane. For years untold has it dwelled in the Source, and some consider it the ever-present consort of the Isle of Ken.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aquamaton

This metallic, mechanical marvel was forged by the dwarves as a means to excavate underwater resources. The moment it entered the ocean, however, it jetted away into the depths like an excited pup, never to return...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cinder Surprise

Charging through the searing desert at improbable speed, this boss of the sand eggs is a mystery wrapped in a concealing shell. Even when cracked open, the true nature of this glowing-eyed enigma is obfuscated beneath a seemingly endless eruption of sooty smoke.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ealad Skaan

Called “butterfly wings” in the faerie tongue in praise of its elegant fins, this wavekin is said to have been glamoured by a pixie to resemble their beloved, departed Titania.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Greater Serpent of Ronka

The great serpent's true form is described as a gargantuan scaled monstrosity. Could the appearance of this...somewhat less impressive creature be a sign that the fabled beast's own return to the forest is imminent? Or is it entirely unrelated?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lancetfish

The lancetfish fills its own body and bones with water to control its buoyancy in the depths of the ocean, leading some to believe it is an incarnation of the deep-sea currents themselves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pecten

A variety of shellfish from the northern seas. In Sharlayan, this mollusk bears no sobriquet, and instead is simply referred to by its malacological name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Northern Herring

When pickled in vinegar, this wavekin is a delight to find on one's dinner plate. More often, however, it ends up in the dough for Archon loaf, as it makes for perfect fish meal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dog-faced Puffer

This puffer's perfectly round face brings to mind the endearing look of a dog begging for treats, which inspired its name. Unlike the lovable creature it so resembles, however, this wavekin is packed to the literal gills with toxins so noxious, it has almost no known predators.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cobalt Chromis

Boasting a rather dazzling color, it is hardly a wonder whence this wavekin's name derives. The aetherial currents in which the creature swims likely played no small role in its scales' brilliance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guitarfish

Despite the fact that this wavekin belongs to the ray family, the guitar enthusiasts that rallied around this wavekin's peculiar shape have seemingly bequeathed it a name so simple, naught can dislodge it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Astacus

Yet another variety of the already ubiquitous crayfish, this wavekin, boiled in salt water, can oft be found upon Sharlayan dining tables in the early days of summer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Peacock Bass

The peacock bass, a variety of wavekin of which there are many and more, is known for its handsome scales and vibrant coloration. This fish is a great favorite among Sharlayan anglers who enjoy long, thoughtful meditations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Academician

The protruberance of this wavekin's brow calls to mind the unquenchable thirst for knowledge and accompanying irritation that plagues so many scholars. Indeed, the weight of its cranial peculiarity upsets its balance to such an extent that it swims as an academic might walk─or rather blearily stumble─after a long night poring over tomes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Swordspine Snook

As lithe and cutting as a rapier, this wavekin slices through rivers at incredible speeds, darting from the river's mouth to its head, feasting on all manner of fish and mollusk in between.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ponderer

This slight, thin-finned wavekin is known for its docility and diffidence, and can oft be found tarrying in the water's darker corners, as if lost in deep contemplation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tidal Dahlia

Watching this creature's innumerable tentacles sway in the current brings to mind the beauty of true dahlias. Unlike the flower from which it takes its name, however, this wavekin does not root itself to one location, but rather rolls across sea and lake bed in search of sustenance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Butterfly Fry

A unique variety of wavekin bred in the Dravanian colony. The exodus saw its return to Old Sharlayan, where the most beautiful specimens are selectively bred and propagated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Xenocypris

This member of the koi family is capable of adapting effortlessly to any and all climes. Its uncommon durability made it a prime candidate for release into the waters of Labyrinthos, the better to test its tolerance to artificial environs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Topminnow

A diminutive wavekin known for its adaptability in the face of both pollution and extreme temperature changes. It feeds on foreign contaminants and the eggs of insects found in the waters circulating from Unmoved Source Alpha.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tessera

A variety of peacock bass whose large stripes distinguish it from others of its kind. As its habitat dictates its pigmentation and patterns, this wavekin is of great interest to researchers in Labyrinthos for both scientific and aesthetic reasons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant Aetherlouse

A freshwater crustacean with a moss-green carapace. Its habit of ingesting aether makes it a crude-yet-effective means for measuring the aetheric concentration of any water source.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fat Snook

A subspecies of snook reared in hypogean hatcheries. Their coloration and musculature differ from that of their superterranean siblings, a fact which is no doubt both meaningful and revealing to those who care about such things.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prochilodus Luminosus

Though perhaps too conspicuous for its own good, this wavekin's shimmering scales and striped orange tail fin make for a welcome sight to naturalists in the know, as its diet of moss and microbial organisms helps maintain balance within the biosphere.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mesonauta

Few would describe this wavekin's coloration as unique, and fewer still can distinguish it from similar species─of which there are many─as its only defining feature is the black stripe that appears when predators encroach upon its territory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Greengill Salmon

This lichen-hued wavekin is entirely unique to Labyrinthos. Its existence proves that breeding species with typically broad migratory patterns within confined environments has promise as a method for developing optimal food sources.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raiamas

Despite every appearance of it being a member of the salmonid class of wavekin, this fish is in fact a variety of koi hatched in Sharlayan and the product of selective breeding. During spawning season, its blue scales instead adopt a red hue.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Bowfin

Though hatched in captivity, this variety of bowfin has existed unchanged since time out of mind, proof that its reddish brown scales provide the perfect camouflage amongst roots or driftwood. Even the safety of an artificial environment has yet to cause it to evolve in any significant way.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Macrobrachium Lar

This variety of long-clawed wavekin is the oldest of its kind and originated in the waters of the Near East, though few are to be found there at present.  Labyrinthos's ichthyologists are currently researching the viability of breeding more in captivity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blowgun

This entomophagous wavekin's pointed snout hides a unique propulsion mechanism that shoots water at high speeds to stun prey. Its incredible level of accuracy has led many to believe that it can detect aetheric fluctuations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darksteel Knifefish

Known for its ominous scales of shimmering sable, legend has it this wavekin is the living manifestation of a thief's blade. Such tall tales were quickly revealed as fiction, though, when ichthyologists began to rear them in hatcheries. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Astacus Aetherius

A propagated color variant, this wavekin has an exquisite cobalt hue which is thought to be caused by the complex aether flowing both above and below ground in Sharlayan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Labyrinthos Tilapia

Though classified as a freshwater wavekin, this fish is capable of surviving in both polluted environs and saltwater. Their copious numbers in Labyrinthos are likely an indication of the quality of their breeding grounds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Trunkblessed

The trunk-like snout for which this wavekin is known is adored by the Matanga of Thavnair. Legend has it that the creature's ancestor─a sadly trunkless fellow, as fish are wont to be─fell so deeply in love with an Arkasodara maiden that it grew its nose out through sheer force of will in the hopes of impressing her.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seema Duta

The waters that flank Meghaduta are teeming with these wavekin, whose fatty flesh makes them exceptionally toothsome. They are often served at dinners hosted by the satrap with a heaping helping of spice-rich sauce.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Longear Sunfish

At the tip of the longear sunfish's opercular bones sit rounded protrusions that greatly resemble ears, which is likely how this wavekin earned its name. In reality, these protuberances are part of its gills, and the faster it swims, the more the “ears” undulate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silver Characin

Treasured in Radz–at–Han since time immemorial, these strikingly silver wavekin can be caught by none other than the satrap and his immediate kin. Poaching them from the waters of Meghaduta is strictly forbidden.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thavnairian Goby

Small, freshwater wavekin whose territory stretches from coral to coast in southern Thavnair. They are oft touted as a local delicacy by the fisherfolk.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Qeyiq Sole

These flatfish bear the name of “boat” in a language spoken by migrants from the continent, likely because they resemble a passing ship's shadow. They can oft be seen slinking along the sandy bottoms of shoals in search of prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gwl Crab

This crab's carapace is so arrestingly cerise, it is no surprise it was bestowed the name of “rose.” Indeed, when multiple gather, they resemble a flower in full bloom. Alas, these roses of the sea, like their floral counterparts, have a thorn─deadly toxins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pantherscale Grouper

Similar to the beast from which its name derives, this wavekin's defining brown spots stretch across the whole of its body. In the grouper's case, however, said spots confuse potential predators by their semblance to eyes rather than acting as camouflage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fate's Design

The dazzling colors of this wavekin's scales oft inspire comparison to Thavnair's vibrant silks. In Thavnair's fishing hamlets, a bride will weave the pattern of a fate's design caught by her betrothed into garments for the ceremony.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadowdart Sardine

Born deep within the abyssal zone, these wavekin migrate upward through the waters in search of prey. By turning to expose their lower fins as the rest of their body lurks in the shadows below, they lure unsuspecting fish above into striking range.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Paksa Fish

With its vicious temperament and superior size, this territorial slickhead reigns supreme over the southern seas. Given its place at the top of the food chain, there is little wonder that it was chosen to bear the name of an ancient Arkasodara king.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garjana Wrasse

The sensation experienced when touching this wrasse's scales is akin to that of being kissed by lightning, giving rise to its name. No doubt related is how the wavekin causes disturbances to aetherial currents, particularly when gathered with others of its kind.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Barramundi

Alchemists of the Great Work are responsible for this wavekin's golden scales. Upon closer inspection, one may find that some bear symbols or even figures in profile, evidence of alchemical attempts to turn them into coinage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kadjaya's Castaway

Found twirling endlessly in the waters of the Giantsgall Grounds, legend has it these wavekin were once dancers who dreamt of performing in Kadjaya's Footsteps before suffering a fall from grace.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marid Frog

The word “massive” does no justice to these toads, who fortunately find a sufficiency of humid air to wet their skin in the jungles of Thavnair. So large are they that many believe they were once Arkasodara, ere being transmuted into amphibians for some manner of alchemical transgression.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bluegill

Once presented to the satrap as a gift, this non-native wavekin is a rare find in Thavnair. Its propagating prowess, which in other lands presents a problem, is mitigated by its seeming inability to acclimatize to Thavnairian waters.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bronze Pipira

A tutelary divinity to those who work in the quarry, this fish has teeth so strong as to shatter stone. Indeed, it chews rocks into pieces so fine that its body absorbs the particles and adopts their color.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Green Swordtail

Well known in Thavnair for their brilliancy of color, these wavekin can be found in fresh water across the island. Unique to the species is that roughly half of its female population change sex over the course of their lifetimes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ksirapayin

Open-mouthed swimming in Ksiroda is what this large wavekin is generally known for. Watching it, one would be forgiven for thinking it is attempting to drink the river dry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wakeful Watcher

Guardian of the Wakeful Torana, this fearsome-looking fish suffers none attempting to slip into the city through waterways unseen.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Drum

Due to both its habitat's proximity to the markets and its highly palatable flesh, this large wavekin fills the bellies of many of Radz–at–Han's citizens on a daily basis.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Forgeflame

Sporting fiery fins, this wavekin is thought to be a wayward ingot sent flying up and out of the Great Work's forge and into the river in which it now calls home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bicuda

As its nomenclature implies, this wavekin's long snout is its defining feature─and a killing machine. Its hydrodynamic shape allows the fish to dart through the waters at high speed and catch prey off guard.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Radzbalik

Oft mistaken for a pile of sunken treasure, this wavekin fetches a high price abroad. Visions of mountains of gil have drawn poachers to the creature's waters, though residents of Thavnair maintain a vigilant watch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Half-moon Betta

This wavekin's already arresting azure and crimson tail grows even more brilliant when kissed by the nacre light of the moon. As such, it comes as little surprise that this fish is a great favorite in Radz–at–Han's wealthier circles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Banana Eel

This eel's similarities to the fruit from which it takes its name are impossible to deny. This serves the wavekin just fine, however, as it uses its unique coloration to entice unsuspecting prey who just want a nice, wet banana.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Handy Hamsa

With its golden head, mottled scales, and overall rotundity, this wavekin bears something of a resemblance to Thavnair's beloved hamsa. Even the fish's darting, unpredictable movements are reminiscent of its land-dwelling namesake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flowerhorn

The impossible-to-ignore cranial protrusion that is this wavekin's claim to fame─rather than being congenital─grows as the fish matures. According to locals, flowerhorns with exceptionally large bumps were anointed in the Font of Maya and thus portend fair tidings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thavnairian Caiman

This ferocious creature's viridescence perfectly matches the hues of its home, allowing it to position itself beneath surface-dwelling prey without being detected. Oral history would indicate that its violent predation is what drove even the most devout from the Font of Maya.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fiery Goby

This bright red wavekin dances across the sandy ocean floor and flits through coral reefs like a flickering aquatic flame. Indeed, schools of these creatures can turn any location into a veritable undersea chandelier.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Puff-paya

This puffer's resemblance to fruit was not lost on the taxonomist who had the pleasure of naming it. Its similarities to the papaya are more than skin-deep, in fact─for when it is detoxified and sun-dried, it makes for a surprisingly sweet treat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Narunnairian Octopus

An oversized octopus that keeps to the waters surrounding Narunnair. It is fiercely protective of its territory, and even the most minor disturbance─whether intentional or accidental─will earn the offender and all in its vicinity a face full of ink.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Roosterfish

Between its haughty bearing and the seven long spines arching from its back that it uses to antagonize fishermen, one might be tempted to call this large wavekin a coxcomb.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Basilosaurus

A sea monster with teeth as deadly and piercing as sharpened lances. Despite having every appearance of a sea-dweller, this serpentine creature is incapable of remaining underwater for long periods of time. As such, it keeps to shallow areas.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garlean Clam

Small though it is, this shellkin produces a considerable amount of tasty soup stock for Garlemald. The lines present on its shell can shed light on environmental changes, thus making the clam of great interest to researchers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eblan Trout

Not even the freezing temperatures of the Eblan Rime can keep this large wavekin from swimming its icy waters. The fatty deposits it uses to keep from becoming a fish-shaped icicle have the added benefit of making this trout so delicious, it can be enjoyed raw.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Animulus

A sedate and unobtrusive wavekin with close ties to the mollusk phylum, the animulus was thought by the Garleans' forebears to be a departed spirit manifesting in the world of the living, and has thus avoided trite comparisons to bellicose gods or capricious fae.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cerule Core

The Empire's researchers studied, dissected, and analyzed this frosty organism in excruciating detail due to its fascinating ability to convert the water's ceruleum into energy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Icepike

Thick, protective scaling hides a body as soft as candy floss, and just as toothsome. Oft used in regional delicacies, this wavekin would enjoy a great deal more popularity were it not such a monstrous pain to flense.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Crown

Sprouting from this wavekin's body like rows of elegant horns are its stygian fins, which resemble naught so much as the imperial diadem. It is said that members of the royal family once fought to acquire this wavekin, that they might be first to present it to the emperor as a show of fealty.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Imperial Pleco

The imperial pleco's black-and-white striping allows it to blend in against the frosty metal of Garlemald's aqueducts, and has fooled many a predator. Alas, as these stripes can be mistaken for the pathway indicators on city streets, it has fooled many a citizen into tripping headlong into the waters as well.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bluetail

This translucent, cerulean catfish generally keeps to deeper waters, but will occasionally rise to the surface. Much more consistent is the alarmed reaction of the capital's citizens when one is sighted in the Stainless Course, as the wavekin bears every resemblance to an ice floe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Star-blue Guppy

This guppy's stunning tail is the color of a much-beloved star viewed from its moon. Naturally, the name for its species was conveyed to the Loporrits by a visitor familiar with Sharlayan taxonomy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lunar Cichlid

The sight of this cichlid's muted blue and pale yellow scales brings to mind the interplay between shadow and moonlight. Said unique coloration has been found to shift according to ambient aetheric density on the lunar surface.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Teareye

This wavekin, with its dark, star-shaped eyes, appears forever on the verge of tears. It is said that it weeps for its long-lost brethren, who traveled to Etheirys's surface as meteoric messengers long ago.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Replipirarucu

An ancient wavekin concept, this species was revived through equally ancient processes. Its odd coloration, however, is new─an apparent result of lackadaisical Loporrits breaking for second breakfast whilst they were meant to be overseeing the fish's reconstruction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Feverfish

This wavekin is capable of breaking down aetherochemical toxins to obtain the nutrients necessary to support itself. Those same toxins, however, degrade its mental faculties to such an extent that it can barely function, let alone swim straight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Calicia

Within aetherochemical pools, this wavekin shines a purplish copper─most likely due to a chemical reaction with its metallic scales. Transferring the fish to a different environment thus changes its coloration completely.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Protomyke #987

Do not be fooled by its wriggling tentacular mycelium─this tiny organism has no sentience whatsoever, and mimics the movements of creatures it lives amongst without even knowing that it does so. It synthesizes other organic matter equally unconsciously as it develops.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lunar Deathworm

One theory posits that one or more of these eons-old creatures was cast down to Hydaelyn via a chance encounter with a comet, and there spawned such wonders as the sand-dwelling Olgoi-Khorkhoi.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fleeting Brand

A parasitic wavekin found lurking in the crevices of the regotoise's large shell. Its resemblance to the pillars of Zodiark's imprisonment that lie scattered across the moon's surface gave rise to its needlessly grandiose name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Regotoise

This turtle's subtle shell allows it to become one with the bleak and barren lunar surface. Loporrits enjoy attempting to convince unsuspecting people that the moon itself is simply a large accretion of these turtles─though this is, of course, a fiction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Isle Skipper

It is the leaf-shaped dorsal fin that allows this creature to catch the wind and hop from island to floating island in Elpis. Some, however, are unable to ride the winds as well as others, and thus drop clean out of the sky to land on the ground, where they flop about impotently.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Iribainion

When this multicolored wavekin leaps from the water's surface, its brilliant scales reflect sunlight through the misty spray in its wake, making it appear as if it is climbing a rainbow to the sky.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Albino Loach

This variety of golden loach was born quite by accident in the Cthonic Horns. Sadly, every attempt at registering its concept has been met with skepticism, as the wavekin is far too susceptible to predation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golden Shiner

Created strictly for aesthetic purposes, this wavekin's glimmering scales cast a brilliant effect across the water's surface, rendering the fish's own beauty sadly dull by comparison.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mangar

Stout and thick, this golden wavekin looks more like an ingot with fins than a fish. Residents of Elpis, however, do not ascribe any particular importance to gold, and thus the mangar's extravagance is largely lost on them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dermogenys

What this wavekin lacks in size is made up for in silvery luster. However, as its shine is the product of the luminescent microbial parasites covering its scales rather than its natural coloration─a dull dirt brown─it is hard to credit the fish's creator for their aesthetic sensibilities.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Antheia

Remarkable even by ancient standards, this “flower among wavekin” is a great favorite in Elpis. Its original creator sought to test the limits of magic by creating the most vivid coloration possible─and is largely thought to have succeeded.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Colossoma

With a name inspired by its distinctive shape, this preposterously thin and tall wavekin has an appetite for bugs, aquatic plants, and seeds, which it pulverizes into tiny particles with its impressive teeth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Smaragdos

This green wavekin befittingly bears the name of “emerald” in the language of the ancients. There are hopes that a comparative study of the primeval bonytongue and this even more ancient creature will yield interesting results.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Superstring

This creature's many waving strands shine with pinpricks of light akin to countless stars. Indeed, any who dares capture it may now hold the fates of entire galaxies in their hands...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Star Eater

Omicron records state that an advanced interstellar civilization bred these wavekin for sustenance. Whether by accident or design, the star eaters proliferated across world after world, and extinguished many a native population.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vacuum Shrimp

Discovered by the Loporrits manning the <Emphasis>Ragnarok</Emphasis>, this cosmic crustacean bears a number of similarities to the common crayfish. This resemblance to creatures found in Hydaelyn's riverbeds is likely a case of convergent evolution rather than the result of innocent arthropods being systematically ejected into the sea of stars, however.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cosmic Noise

With black-and-white coloration like unto that of a magitek monitor disabled by a sudden sandstorm, this creature is notable for its ability to mimic the magnetic turbulence of aetherochemical pools to disorient and snare its prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glassfish

At first blush, this wavekin appears to be naught more than a floating bag of bones. In reality, it has a large, translucent frame─occasionally made visible thanks to the suspect contents of aetherochemical pools─and relatively standard organs concealed within its skull.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Foun Myhk

A creature whose origins can be traced back to the Dragonstar. Though this herbivore is relatively low on the food chain, its subsistence by means of riding aetheric wind currents across the stars to graze upon tree leaves was nonetheless impressive─until it was caught and unceremoniously grounded. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dragonscale

Similar to what men might call “chirurgeon fish,” these wavekin can be found attached to the scales of grown wyrms, nibbling away at the parasites upon which they feed and other detritus.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ypupîara

Meteion made contact with these life-forms somewhere in the cosmos. One theory posits that they are all that remains of a once-sentient race whose mental faculties were obliterated through some arcane mischance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eehs Forhnesh

A predator capable of swallowing a dragon egg whole. With no such eggs available to it, it now mindlessly swims aetherochemical springs, jaw slack and mouth agape.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Katoptron

The flecks of white on this wavekin's azure body sparkle as it moves. Its multiple layers of scales are not unlike a telescope, reflecting the image of galaxies located thousands of light-years away.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Comet Tail

Protruding red gills are the most aesthetically pleasing of this wavekin's many and varied respiratory organs, which allow it to survive in a variety of environs. Scholars insist that they are the result of direct exposure to highly concentrated aether following the collision of two celestial bodies, rather than a duller process such as evolution.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aoide

Atrophied optic nerves force this creature to use the faint electricity encasing its body to map its surroundings. The pulsating frequency that results echoes to the deepest reaches of the cosmos like an endless dirge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Protoflesh

Developed by the Ea to test the viability of returning to flesh-based bodies, this specimen was likely modeled after one of the few organic beings its creators managed to remember.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wandering Starscale

As a satellite forever orbits its star, so too does this wavekin follow an elliptical trail around and around a pole perceptible only to its species. Should the fish veer too far from its orbit, it would surely perish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wormhole Worm

Capable of swallowing prey whole, this invertebrate and its digestive organs are enigmas wrapped in mystery, as no matter what it ingests, its weight never fluctuates. If any have discovered this creature's inner workings, doubtless they are no longer of this universe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Flying Biomass II

Given its high polymer resinoid shell is so dense that it remains nigh impossible to open, some theorize that UFB-II is in fact a ship within which reside countless sentient─though nevertheless delicious─beings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Triaina

This creature's name was no doubt inspired by its two chelae and its toxin-laced stinger, the three of which create a trident of pain. Its sweet, pleading eyes lull one into a false sense of security─the leading theory of how it came to terrorize and oppress those on its home world.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sophos Deka-okto

Unique in its remarkable ability to read the movements of the stars, this wavekin is capable of predicting which celestial body will next wither into nonexistence. At the point in time at which it was caught, it had been awaiting the arrival of a hapless fool who it knew would carry it across the stars.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Class Twenty-four

A member of the seventh civilization with which Meteion came into contact, this many-legged entity's culture prizes the number of limbs one possesses above all else, seeing each as a mark of higher intellect. One can only imagine its despair at being fished up by a primitive organism with a mere four.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrifyingway

A Loporrit was once nearly devoured whole after mistaking this cephalopod's tentacles for ears. They know not how fortunate they were to run screaming away when they did, for this wavekin has been observed digesting its prey slowly─and to all appearances, painfully─through its translucent body.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Alien Mertone

Their ability to twist the minds of men has inspired some to refer to these ultrabright cephalopods as “hallucination” aliens, though some of the specificity of their true name is lost in translation. They appear not dissimilar to an octopus in low-gravity pools, but one can only wonder what terrifying form they take in other environments─wonder, and pray that it is not bipedal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Monster Carrot

The elongated proboscis protruding from its cylindrical torso allows this curious being to feast on stardust. Though it does not, by all accounts, eat Loporrits, one did claim to have a nightmare in which they were assailed by an evil carrot that looked eerily similar.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Argonaut

This tentacled wayfarer has, for all intents and purposes, become one with its aether-propelled carapace, so effective is it for travel between stars. Indeed, the creature flies through the cosmos at speeds nearing that of sound.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Echinos

This intimidating ball of spindly spikes hides a soft underbelly which tastes a great deal like urchin. The taste is so similar, in fact, it lends credence to the theories which suggest Hydaelyn's urchins can trace their lineage to the sea of stars.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Space Bishop

Once sentient and vaguely manlike, this creature accidentally transformed itself into a desiccated husk following a botched attempt at immortality. Now, it can do naught save drift sadly along the currents of the cosmos.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Alyketos

Its diminutive limbs theoretically allow this creature to walk on land, though it has long lost the need for such a skill following the destruction of its star. Should it ever find a place to call home again, perhaps it will regain the ability.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Horizon Event

Characteristic of this octopus are its membranous limbs and entropically addled brain. The latter is only explicable if one accepts the absurd idea that this creature was once inside a region so dense that gravity prevents its very observation, and then was summarily cast out by forces unknown. As it has no memory of this─or anything whatsoever─the truth remains elusive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
E.B.E.-9318

Though it resembles naught so much as a free-floating eyeball, the Ea insist that this creature is in fact a mere appendage of an “extra-dimensional” entity with which they made contact during their “space-time exploration phase,” meant to keep an eye on the observable cosmos. Those familiar with said cosmos attest that in either case, it has likely “seen some things.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unbegotten

With a bulbous head that tapers into an incongruously tiny back half, this creature is almost comedic. Do not let its curious design deceive, however, for it is said to be an ill omen, appearing only when a civilization's end draws nigh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Phallaina 

This oddly proportioned, sharklike creature sails the wispy aether currents of the sea of stars on wings more expansive than it is long. Despite every appearance to the contrary, its physical composition has more in common with flora than the fauna it resembles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aetherolectric Guitarfish

Fascinating despite its repulsive countenance, this massive guitarfish creates weak electrical currents through the vibration of its gills─the potency of which vary depending on the speed it is moving. Reports of fishermen unwittingly bobbing their heads to the symphony of notes produced by this curious phenomenon led to the creature's present nomenclature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jumbo Snook

This burly wavekin has grown to its gargantuan size by gorging itself on the bountiful nutrients found in the waters circulating from Unmoved Source Alpha. Astonishingly muscle-bound, it spends its days swimming against the tide, further embiggening itself to─one assumes─compensate for its fragile ego.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Earful

Capable of extending and flattening its earlike fins at amazing speed, this peculiar creature at times resembles a child throwing their hands over their ears in petulance. In turn, the children of Thavnair are careful not to cover their ears when being scolded by their elders, lest they be forced to endure a wholly different earful come dinner.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hippo Frog

An amphibian with the terrible proclivity to swallow its prey whole─even should that prey be its equal in size. The sight of its wide-open mouth in the water is strikingly similar to that of the hippos known to inhabit the northern region of Thavnair.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rimepike

Many an unsuspecting tooth has cracked upon this creature's scales, notorious for being harder than even the ice of the Eblan Rime. Simmering it for several hours, however, is said to have a transformative effect on the wavekin, allowing diners to masticate with molars intact.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Foun Ahlm

This organism's name can be roughly translated to “tranquil bird.” It is said that dragonkind once cherished the gentle winds this creature flies upon, but none remain to appreciate the rare sight of a placid foun ahlm adrift on the aetherial breeze.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Forbiddingway

This curious cephalopod extends its limbs in often successful attempts to threaten those who approach. To wit, a brave Loporrit once attempted to stare it down in a clash of wills, but was tragically brought low when they could no longer bear the forbidding look of the creature's eyes and earlike protrusions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thavnairian Calamari

So undisputably delectable is this squid that it is served in every restaurant and food stall found along the coasts of Thavnair. Whilst extolling its virtues when both fried and dried, locals often add that a dragoon from a distant land once purchased a veritable starship's worth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seedtoad

A resourceful species of toad that conceals itself through camouflage, blending in with seeds on the riverbed. Considered ideal familiars, one must approach them with care, for they will sprout legs and flee the very moment they perceive a threat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Holier-than Mogpom

An exceedingly unusual sphere of algae that glitters radiant as a crystal. The belief that pom-poms blessed by copious amounts of aether turn a beautiful shade of violet after death is one commonly held among mooglekind, which raises several questions both related and unrelated to the matter at hand.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Chalky Coral

A white shade of coral harvested from the Near East. A group of sailors departing Yedlihmad once sneakily pocketed fragments of the reef to use as writing implements for a sudden voyage, and discovered how remarkable it was in the process. The chalk made from this coral soon took the world by storm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Greatsword Snook

This prodigious and particularly keen snook has given rise to rumor that Studium pupils loosed a misguided attempt at autonomous weaponry into Sharlayan's streams, where it now lurks in wait for the toes of unwary bathers. While this estimation of students' propensity to engage in dangerous experiments “for science” is not inaccurate, the fish is mostly harmless.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Swampsucker Bowfin

The swampsucker bowfin prowls the muddy depths of its freshwater home, inhaling muck, nutritious vilekin, and unfortunate frogs all the same. As a result of this indiscriminating method of predation, it is just as often found regurgitating clouds of silt.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lale Crab

Among the rosaceous gwl crabs clustered along Thavnair's shores may be found brighter and more keenly shaped specimens─distinctive blooms all their own. So elegant are their wine-colored carapaces and delicate steps that any noblewoman of Radz-at-Han treasures the gift of a lale crab above that of its namesake tulip, integrity of her suitors' digits be damned.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bigcuda

Although bicuda are known for their magnitude, the bigcuda dwarfs its kin. It defends its place in its species' size-based hierarchy─and commensurate territory─with a ferocity bordering on the savage, though theories that it has thinned out the competition by taking bites out of its kin remain unsubstantiated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sovereign Shadow

This wavekin's delicate stygian fins resemble naught so much as tendrils of shadow. Oral history holds that the Empire's sovereigns have traditionally bequeathed such creatures to members of their nigh-unseen personal guard─though whether out of a fondness for metaphor or mere aesthetic appreciation, only the imperial family could say.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Disappirarucu

Ever in pursuit of ways to delight the inhabitants of Etheirys, the Loporrits endeavored to refine their replipirarucu design in order to offer greater challenge to its anglers. The natural conclusion to their experimentation was the advent of the disappirarucu, which none among Loporrit kind has seen since.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Starscryer

Created by a fallen civilization particularly fond of divination, this wavekin was once believed to convey celestial portents. Given the outcome, its tidings may have been too dire to bear─or perhaps its makers simply overestimated the prophetic capacity of what is, to all appearances, a glorified lungfish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Argonauta argo

Inside this single spacefaring shell undulate not one, but two argonauts. Though it is not wholly unusual for creatures to mate for life, this pair shows a remarkable dedication to remaining entangled within their vessel until the end of time itself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Planetes

Even more lustrous than one's average mangar, the planetes was so named by a taxonomist of some repute, who marked the transient light it cast up to the surface as it wandered through Rumination's Ramble.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mayashell

This ancient turtle has long bathed in the maya of its aquatic habitat, making even a pinch of its powdered shell a surpassing source of alchemical power.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Catastrophizer

Grown uncommonly large, the catastrophizer stands out in a school of its smaller relatives─an undesirable prominence which has resulted in a timid, anxious temperament. Whether attempting to feed or simply find a quiet place to exist, this wavekin appears to be on constant lookout for approaching doom.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mossgill Salmon

The mossy growth between the scales of this greengill salmon gives it an especially verdant appearance. Far from being detrimental, the moss is said to aid in keeping the creature's microbial organisms in a healthy state.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vidyutvat Wrasse

A tropical fish whose Hannish name means “thundercloud.” It can often be found swimming dead center in a school of garjana wrasse, every ilm the reigning deity of its electrifying subjects.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Browned Banana Eel

A somewhat overripe banana eel. When hunting, this specimen compensates for its less-than-enticing appearance by secreting fluid with the scent and consistency of thickened fruit juice.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frozen Regotoise

This creature is a particularly long-lived specimen of the regotoise family. In keeping with a popular fiction they derived from gods know where, the Loporrits insist that the Frozen Fissure is, in fact, just one of the grooves in the massive moon tortoise's craggy shell.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cosmic Haze

While the cosmic noise is strictly black and white, certain scales of the larger cosmic haze will glimmer with an aurora-like glow. Other wavekin find these points of light irresistible, the bemusing enchantment persisting right up until the jaws snap shut.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Antheian Dahlia

The fins of this striking wavekin resemble the delicate petals of the dahlia. With the addition of new antheian varieties, the original creator hoped to turn the waters of Lethe into a shifting field of flowers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ondo Kelp

This substantial and nutrient-rich seaweed was originally cultivated at the bottom of the Tempest, but was introduced to Kholusia when brought to market by the Ondo. As it is now quite popular amongst land-dwellers, experiments to grow it closer to the ocean's surface proceed apace.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Purpure Cod

It is said that an Ondo youth first discovered this reclusive fish living in the depths of Purpure and found it so delectable that they secretly feasted upon it for moons, unwilling to share their bounty.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Il Lydha

Believed to be a new variation of shellfish created by recent changes to the flow of aether along the ocean floor, this captivating rainbow-colored clam was commemoratively christened by Bismarck.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jhinga

This plump and delicious prawn is a popular main ingredient on the isle of Thavnair. Baked whole or added to curry, no part of the crustacean is wasted─even a meal's leftover shells find their way into alchemical concoctions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Phyllinos

A wavekin created to resemble a piece of leafy vegetation. So successful was this endeavor, the phyllinos was almost registered as a plant species. Until it laid eggs, that is.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Platinum Seahorse

Smitten with its precious platinum gleam, Lakeland nobles will pay top coin to have this rare wavekin for their private aquariums. Apothecaries, too, prize its dried remains as an ingredient for various alchemical mixtures.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Clavekeeper

This singular species of moray dwells primarily on the coast of Kholusia, and is so named for its inexplicable habit of threatening anyone or anything which approaches the Clave. While most consider this behavior passing strange, others regard these self-appointed guardians with a degree of reverence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mirror Image

Legend has it that when a preening Voeburtite princess admired her own beauty in the surface of Handmirror Lake, the pattern on her dress and the rosiness of her cheeks was reflected onto the scales of a surprised fish. Along with the coloration, the mirror image is also said to have acquired the young royal's imperious bearing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spangled Pirarucu

The Ronkans once wore clothing sewn with coins, and the glimmering scales of the spangled pirarucu appear to be keeping that ancient fashion trend alive. Catching one of these sparkling specimens has been likened to reeling in a wriggling treasure trove.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Onyx Knifefish

Sharlayan ichthyologists held a number of symposiums to narrow down the myriad suggestions for substances darker than darksteel when naming this anomalous knifefish. That it is both more stygian and more lustrous than its kin that yet dwell in the species' native habitat is attributed to ideal breeding conditions in captivity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wakeful Warden

Born with a most dignified visage by wavekin standards, this fish was often flanked by schools of wakeful watchers as it dutifully guarded the waterways of Radz-at-Han, and was even to be granted the status of honorary Radiant. Now that it has been hauled up from its home, however, it shall receive no such recognition.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Basilosaurus Rex

This vicious creature is as a king amongst its species. Given that basilosaurs are already termed “kings amongst lizards,” this makes for confusing nomenclature, but given this specimen's particular tendency to tear into interlopers, rivals, and even minor inconveniences with its razor-sharp teeth, naturalists have elected to simply append “rex” to its title and back away slowly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eehs Fan

In ages past, this shark would swallow whole the wayward sparks of dragonkind, that it might absorb the long-lived creatures' vitality. The “devourer of flames,” as it was known on the Dragonstar, continued its desperate search to the very end, vying for the faintest bits of energy in the sighs of Ultima Thule's spectral dragons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gilt Dermogenys

Perhaps to prove those who doubted their aesthetic sensibilities wrong, this wavekin's creator sought to adjust its symbiotic microbes in pursuit of a specimen that would glitter like the sun that fell upon it. After much trial and error, the star was graced with dermogenys species new and old─the original haloed in silver, its younger cousin, gold.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepshade Sardine

While the ink-black scales of this sardine give it the gift of camouflage in the dead of night, it curses the light of day, hiding in the shadows and seeking wider migratory routes to avoid potential predators─a tactic effective against all dangers save the angler's lure.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sirensong Mussel

In making its abode on the seabeds and reefs of the Sirensong Sea, this mussel quietly wreaks carnage upon other marine life by creating nigh-unnavigable mazes of razor-sharp shells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrowhead

This wavekin is known for swimming through the seas faster than a loosed arrow. Less well known is that, once suitably dried, its fins are as sharp as its namesake, which goes some way toward explaining the otherwise nonsensical squid-based harpoons referenced in many a fishwives' tale.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ruby Herring

This variety of herring is a common catch when trawling the seas surrounding Kugane. Its varied culinary uses see that demand is always of a pace with supply, and thus has the Ruby herring filled the coinpurses and stomachs of the local smallfolk for generations.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whirlpool Turban

The unique grooves on these wavekin's spiral shells are believed to disrupt ocean currents, creating whirlpools wheresoever they bob in shallow tides. The fishers of Kugane pay little attention to cautionary tales surrounding them, however, as the flesh pairs exceedingly well with soy sauce.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leopard Prawn

Cousins to the Yanxian tiger prawn, these crustaceans are scrutinized at market like a cut of expensive beef─per the gastronomically astute, the more vivid and varied the pattern of the carapace, the richer the flesh will be.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Kelp

A number of Far Eastern gastronomical experts rate crimson kelp among the most indispensable ingredients in Far Eastern cuisine. Prepared in a multitude of mouthwatering ways, it sees use in stock, seasoning, and as a dish unto itself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Reef Squid

Though these wavekin's migration pattern covers most Far Eastern waters, it is to the Ruby Sea's rocky reefs that they return to deposit their eggs. Relatively average as far as stature is concerned, reef squid typically grow to two fulms at the longest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pinebark Flounder

These flounder were given their arboreal appellation for the bark-like patterns that mark their scales. Prized as delicacies by the upper echelons of Kugane, the wavekin are sold directly to the finest eateries in the city, and thus are rarely ever seen at market.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Catching Carp

Found in freshwater sources across Yanxia, these shy carp prefer to remain in shallow waters for the majority of their lives, hiding under the leaves and roots of the local aquatic plant life. During spawning season, however, they become far more aggressive─if a tranquil pond suddenly comes alive with the sound of splashing, catching carp are likely to blame.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Garlean Bluegill

An invasive species once unique to Garlemald, this bluegill was introduced to the Far East during the Empire's occupation. The residents of Yanxia, desiring revenge against the Garleans in a manner that would not endanger themselves or their families, hunted down the marine invaders as a small act of rebellion, preventing their manifold multiplication.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yanxian Softshell

Yanxians prize the nutrient-rich meat of softshell turtles, historically imbibing their blood as a cure-all. Judging this to be “savage,” the Empire prohibited the practice upon the region's annexation, and it is yet unclear how this will affect Yanxian tradition long-term.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pink Shrimp

The vivid hues of this crustacean's shell are reminiscent of a cherry tree in bloom. Though other shrimp require tedious peeling and declawing before they can be eaten, the pink shrimp's carapace is pleasantly chewable. Whether its flesh is dried or baked into a savory biscuit, those who have had the pleasure of eating it claim to have glimpsed a mythical realm known only as “shrimp heaven.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sirensong Mullet

One tale of the Sirensong Sea speaks of these “singing scourges” as harbingers that surround doomed fishing vessels ere the crew is caught in a siren's sweet serenade. Any angler who hauls one up should do so quietly, lest they drive an entire ship of seamen to hysterical tears.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Selkie Puffer

Though this fish supposedly resembles a mythological being known as a selkie, few sailors have actually laid eyes upon such a creature. As such, the comparison may be thoroughly inaccurate, provoking the ire of selkies skulking in seaside taverns with every utterance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spear Squid

These sharp-headed cephalopods are believed to bring good fortune to those who wield the spears they were named for─immediately, if said lancer enjoys dried squid as a snack. This perhaps explains the high demand for spear squid in Ishgard in recent years.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Floating Lantern

Weaving through the tides like a paper lantern lost in a soft summer breeze, this glowing invertebrate was once thought by local fishers to be a malevolent spirit known as a “bake-chochin,” playing tricks on unknowing passersby with its alluring lamplight. The discovery of its true nature was embarrassing for all present, save the jellyfish, which appeared unperturbed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rubescent Tatsunoko

Fortunate enough to share the red-and-white coloration of the leopard prawn, these meek wavekin use the coincidence to their advantage, curling up and blending in with colonies of crustaceans to avoid conflict with other species. They may be biding their time as they grow, knowing they will one day rise upon the waves as Ruby Dragons...or not.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mantle Moray

Resembling the divine raiments worn by the Ruby Princess, this translucent blue moray sways elegantly in the currents. The more transparent the eel's scales, the higher the price it will fetch at market, and merchants make a pretty gil selling the seemingly ephemeral wavekin to collectors eager to boast of their precious find.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Barded Lobster

These female lobsters are twice as large as their male counterparts, spiny lobsters, and no less fit for battle. During breeding season, pairs resemble a knight taking the field atop his faithful steed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sanbaso

This knifejaw's stripes create a striking resemblance to the patterned hat donned during the ceremonial sanbaso dance. Much like these performances, the fish are believed to herald peace between nations and bountiful harvests in days to come.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Princess Salmon

Unlike most other salmon species, the princess does not migrate out to sea, and lives out its entire life in familiar freshwater. Its succulent flesh was the favorite of a popular Doman princess generations past, which led to it being given its name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Calligraph

This subspecies of lightscale is unique for having scales that look as though they had ink dripped upon them. According to Far Eastern legend, it came into being when a monk skilled at calligraphy held a brush over the One River and spilled a few drops of ink into the water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Singular Shrimp

Normally a deep green, this shrimp turns red as a plum blossom when cooked. While its flesh is somewhat tough, it boasts a singular springiness that people grow to love, and it has long been a One River specialty.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Poet's Pipe

A species of saltwater fish that is likened to an ocarina on account of its shape. Legend holds that, enchanted by a siren's song, a bard cast himself into the sea, and from the instrument he was clutching this fish was born.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Marine Matanga

With its large eyes, grey body, and long nose, it is not hard to see why this shark is considered the Matanga of the sea. A folktale claims that it is the reincarnated form of a Matanga high priest who had spent years in solemn meditation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hatatate

Meaning “standard-bearer” in the Far Eastern tongue, the hatatate is identifiable by its prominent and forward-swept dorsal fin, a characteristic which earned it its name. Considered a symbol of bravery in Hingashi, it is favored among warrior families as an ornamental fish.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silent Shark

Likened to and named for a mouse in the Far East, this shark is a swift and silent hunter that strikes before its prey is able to mount any resistance. Ranging broadly, it can be found in the Ruby Sea and all along the continental coastline.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shisui Goby

Although mainly found in the coral reefs surrounding Shisui of the Violet Tides, this variety of goby is also known to migrate widely upon the currents of the Ruby Sea. The people of Sui-no-Sato look upon them affectionately as little servants of the palace.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Violet Sentry

Possessed of powerful jaws and dreadful fangs, this ancient crocodilian beast is said to be a guardian of Shisui of the Violet Tides. Together with the crimson sentry, a gargantuan shark, it protects the palace from would-be interlopers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brocade Carp

Since olden days, this carp has been prized as an ornamental fish in the Far East. Although breeders exist who specialize in the species, many exceptionally beautiful specimens can be found even in the wilds of the One River.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yanxian Sturgeon

Existing since prehistoric times, this fish possesses peculiar butterfly-shaped patterns upon its shark-like body─traits that have earned it the appellation “butterfly shark” in the Far East. Its flavorsome roe is enjoyed as a rare delicacy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dusk Shark

A ferocious shark that is said to haunt every sunken ship in the Sirensong Sea. Its grey body makes it appear like a spirit of the dead in the dark depths, on account of which it is feared and loathed by sailors.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mizuhiki

A fish of white and crimson named for its resemblance to the rice paper cords traditionally used to wrap gifts in Hingashi. Those who manage to hook one of these decorative creatures are said to be blessed with good fortune.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavensent Shark

Legend has it this fish was once a mythical tiger come from the farthest reaches of Heaven-on-High. Why such a divine beast might forgo its stripes for speckled spots─and the form of a shark, besides─remains a mystery to this day, but the wavekin is nevertheless considered an omen of bounteous catches to come.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fishy Shark

Grass sharks of this subspecies are speculated to be close cousins─or at least good friends─of the Namazu. Though its behavior may engender suspicion, the fishy shark's tendency to linger amid the vegetation of the riverbed arises from a fondness for scratching its hide against the verdure rather than more sinister motives.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mermaid Scale

This mollusk's blue and purple hues are made all the more vibrant by the aether-rich spectral waters it calls home. Though the mermaid supposed to have shed these “scales” invariably eludes them, sailors continue to fancy she is just out of sight whensoever they happen upon one.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Broadhead

As its moniker suggests, a well-aimed broadhead darts through the water as swiftly as an arrow. No sooner do its tentacles latch onto its prey than does its powerful barbed beak sink into its victim's flesh, rendering all attempts to remove it futile.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vivid Pink Shrimp

Aether-rich spectral currents are believed to be the secret of this shrimp's brilliant pink shade, as well as its exceedingly resilient shell. Indeed, the crustacean's carapace is so strong that shipwrights often fashion its legs and pincers into nails for their vessels. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunken Coelacanth

This ray-finned fish is highly sensitive to aetherial fluctuations in spectral currents. As fossils have surfaced the world over, researchers believe the species periodically migrates according to the aetheric density of the water.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Siren's Sigh

Often spotted congregating around wreckage on the ocean floor, these fish were named for the sirens thought to lure ships to their demise.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Black-jawed Helicoprion

The lower jaw of this wavekin continues to grow until it folds back on itself and coils, creating a suitable tool for grinding captured prey against rocks. As one might expect, red waters are a telltale sign one has entered its feeding grounds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Impostopus

By making full use of their tentacles, these cephalopods are said to be capable of impersonating any living creature. While they clearly understand the composition of their subjects, impostopodes seem to enjoy adding additional eyes to these imitations by way of their suction cups.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jade Mantis Shrimp

Making its home in the Sea of Jade, this species of crustacean is well known for the breathtaking green of its carapace─a color with which it seems rather singularly taken in spite of its ability to perceive myriad hues. To maintain the desired coloration, individuals will migrate along spectral currents upon coming of age, in search of the perfect environment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nymeia's Wheel

Legends say that each time the goddess Nymeia drops a spinning wheel, it falls from the heavens and becomes a shell for one of these enormous tortoises. The sheer number of these wavekin suggests that even the Twelve are fallible. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Snapping Koban

Spectral currents make the blue skin of this wavekin almost transparent, causing its yellow fins and mouth to appear as coins floating just under the ocean's surface. Many a greedy sailor has fallen overboard after reaching out a little too far over the bulwark. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silkweft Prawn

These wavekin are named for the fine material of the nets used to catch them. Connoisseurs insist that any other netting would ruin the prawn's delicate flesh, while others claim it is merely a pretext to sell the crustacean at an inflated price.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stingfin Trevally

The striking blue fins of this wavekin contain a venom made deadly by the aetherial concentration of spectral currents. A skilled chef can cut out the stingfin's meat without causing contamination, although few consider the reward to be worth the risk.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Swordtip Squid

The sleek, clear body of this wavekin has inspired countless swordsmiths during their seaborne journeys. Opinions are divided on whether the dried swordtip squid or dried spear squid is tastier, with one's martial background apparently being the main indicator of preference.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mailfish

This wavekin's silver scales are reminiscent of chainmail. It swims with its head bowed, and this mannerism has made it popular as a symbol of the Far East's hospitable culture.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Idaten's Bolt

These fish dart through the water at blinding speed that, per Far Eastern sailors, can only be the will of the kami. Spectral currents sometimes propel them with such force that they skip out of water, flying through the air at velocities to rival those of passing airships.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Maelstrom Turban

Feasting upon the nutrients replete in spectral currents, these shelled wavekin grow to prodigious sizes. In the folklore of Hingashi are tales of gale winds caused by the shell's unique structure, and many still believe the maelstrom turban to be the source of inclement weather in the region.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shoshitsuki

The speed of these enormous sharks has seen them named for the demons that fleet-footed Idaten pursued across the firmament. A single fearsome pod can hold dominion over a territory stretching from the Ruby Sea to Kugane. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spadefish

One legend tells of a young farmer who, yearning for the excitement of city life, cast his spade into a nearby canal. The spade turned into a fish which then swam the long journey to Kugane, although whether the farmer followed suit differs depending on the storyteller's intended moral.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fleeting Squid

This wavekin's body is shaped like a leaf, and its color changes to adapt to its environment. A school of fleeting squid swimming through a spectral current looks like an upside down forest, inviting one to become lost among its sunken paths.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bowbarb Lobster

Characterized by its long whiskers, a male bowbarb lobster placed upon its back and viewed from exactly the right angle resembles a bowman taking aim.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pitch Pickle

This rare species of sea pickle was a favorite of Hingan nobility in generations past. As was the fashion at the time, they preferred to dye their teeth black, and a single pitch pickle was a swift means to a stygian smile.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Senbei Octopus

When fished from the sea, this octopus folds its body into a shape not unlike the round crackers popular in the Far East. As an inevitable consequence, many a sailor has been caught by surprise when their late-night snack transformed into a ball of writhing tentacles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tentacle Thresher

Although this species of shark could have its pick of the ocean's bounty, it seems strangely fixated on hunting octopodes. Only in extreme states of hunger has a specimen been observed eating anything else, and even then, only enough to last until the next tentacled morsel comes along.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bekko Rockhugger

The spread of these wavekin to various regions is credited to spectral currents, which are the only force strong enough to wrest them from their rocky homes. Their tendency to settle on the ocean floor has earned them the favor of the Kojin, who sense a kindred spirit in the fish.   


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yellow Iris

The delicate yellow scales of this fish belie its invasive nature, and many an ecosystem has been disrupted by the yellow iris's arrival on currents from afar. Sailors know to batten down the hatches upon sighting a school of them, for they invariably carry rough seas in their wake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crimson Sentry

One of the two guardians of Shisui of the Violet Tides, this sentry has many times stained the sea red with the blood of those foolish enough to encroach upon the sacred halls.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flying Squid

Perhaps due to spending less time in the ocean than its seabound cousins, flying squid is considered inferior in flavor to other varieties of dried squid. Due to its low price and high availability, however, it is a staple among the commonfolk. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gensui Shrimp

As this shrimp ages, its body becomes a deep shade of green. It is reminiscent of a legend of the Gensui Chain about a hermit whose skin took on the hue of the sweeping hills he lived among, leading some locals to call the species “hermits”─to the discomfit of foreign diners.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yato-no-kami

Yanxian legend tells of an ancient demon that once haunted the region, siphoning its nutrients and preventing the people from cultivating their land. A group of brave monks risked life and limb to seal it away and cast it into a spectral current, consigning it to a life of eternal wandering.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heron's Eel

Eels of the Heron's Way often grow too large to sustain themselves on their environment's meager offerings, and make their way to the One River in search of a feast befitting their station. This has led to their consumption as a delicacy, with merchants seeing a reflection of their own journey in the eel's, though the flavor is naught to write home about.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crowshadow Mussel

The jet black shell of this bivalve mollusk can grow up to a fulm in length, giving it the appearance of a crow spreading its wings under the waves. The inside of the shell, however, is a dazzling pearly white.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yanxian Goby

This species of goby has migrated south from the Azim Steppe. The aether-rich spectral currents are their domain, and they swim through the turbulent waters without challenge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Iridescent Trout

Spectral currents have given this wavekin's scales a faint iridescence. They are highly valued by artisans of the Far East, with the most radiant scales fetching a high price at auction.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Un-Namazu

This unremarkable catfish is believed to have once been a Namazu so indolent that he reversed nature's course, regressing into the primitive form of his ancestors. Let this be a warning to any Namazu that would lie listlessly in his jar while there is work to be done, yes, yes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gakugyo

According to a Far Eastern faerie tale, a white rabbit from the moon once placed this wavekin into the One River and utilized its sprawling form as a bridge. Given the gakugyo's rancorous demeanor, any such meeting seems more likely to result in the rabbit's being devoured whole, but perhaps it was of milder temperament before being thoroughly trod upon by hippity-hoppity feet.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ginrin Goshiki

Boasting scales of deep vermilion and silver, this paragon among carp makes its abode within spectral currents, thus its vivid coloration. From the water's surface, the wavekin reflects light much like a glimmering gold ingot, and as a result, many an unknowing sailor has fallen overboard in pursuit of false riches.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Coelacanth

Its species having survived for a number of Astral Eras with strikingly few evolutionary gains, this particular coelacanth apparently decided it was high time for a change. After many a moon spent swimming the spectral currents, it has achieved partially crystalline scales and a glorious blue glow.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Wrasse

Ichthyologists have spent many sleepless nights studying the behaviors of the spectral wrasse, unable to understand what drives them to chase spectral currents─if, indeed, extant specimens did not end up there by accident. The single paper published on the subject, entitled “No Wrasse for the Wicked,” has been responsible for several leaving the profession entirely.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Snake Eel

While the majority of snake eels tend to lurk under the sands and await the coming of their prey, these creatures─likely realizing that such tactics are not quite as effective when one has sparkling blue scales─have been spotted near the water's surface, blending in with the azure surf to catch their victims unawares.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectral Kotsu Zetsu

When the spectral currents affect a kotsu zetsu, its bone-like tongue takes on the same glow as its scales. These appendages are highly valued by local artisans, who utilize special tools to clean and carve them into luminous pendants and finery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Taniwha

Though “taniwha” is oft translated from the language of the south sea isles as merely “dangerous shark,” the slumbering creatures' backs are said to support many of the islands themselves. Accordingly, legend has it that their modern descendants make yearly migrations to the southern seas to ensure that their ancestors are well treated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glass Dragon

Said to have ruled the eastern seas alongside the Ruby Dragon, this living legend sports a set of silvery scales that shimmer in the sun. Some historians go so far as to claim it an auspice who clashed mightily with Seiryu in ages past.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hells' Claw

This formidable king of the Crab Pots dons an armored shell of volcanic rock to protect itself against would-be predators. While this defense mechanism has proven successful, the sweltering heat of its once-molten carapace would cook the crustacean from the inside out had it not made a habit of launching itself into the cool depths of the Ruby Sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jewel of Plum Spring

Wanting nothing more than to swim in the limpid waters it had long admired from afar, a wise old tree of Plum Spring is said to have shaped one of its knots into this flowering turtle. Though the plum blossoms are often submerged when the creature dives, their petals miraculously show no signs of wear.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fury's Aegis

For reasons as of yet unknown, Sharlayan naturalists have recently been inundated by a veritable mountain of inquiries from anonymous adventurers asking why this species of shrimp does not have the ability to transform into a shrimp-sized sword and fire shrimp-sized beams of rime. Perplexed by the specificity of the question, they have been unable to give a satisfactory answer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gold Dustfish

Such is the beauty of this creature's aurulent scales that it has been likened to a treasure once lost by the Nabaath royal family to the dunes of Amh Araeng.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Forgiven Melancholy

Whether this entity is an albino fish or a sin eater masquerading as one has long been a matter of debate among Crystarium naturalists. Recent testimony from former inhabitants of the Derelicts, however, may at last tip the scales─evidently, the creature tastes uncannily similar to meol.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oil Slick

The scales of this creature glisten with a cacophony of colors like unto the surface of gleaming oil─a useful form of camouflage amidst the iridescent sheen of the iron-rich plunge basin it calls home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gonzalo's Grace

According to Kholusian legend, this brightly colored echinoderm once served a princely sort who found himself stranded far out to sea. After a series of trials involving literacy, magic, and a rather abrupt masque, Gonzalo returned his liege to his rightful place and vanished amongst the tides, never to be seen again─until an adventurer from another world unknowingly reeled him in.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Circuit Tilapia

Naturally lengthy lifespans make these wavekin ideal subjects for long-term monitoring. They are thus the indispensable companions of Sharlayan researchers involved in the study and maintenance of water quality, who at this point have named quite a number with appellations befitting their individual countenances.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Durdina Fish

Protective of their underwater kingdoms as Paksa fish may be, none have yet been known to defy the authority of this particular specimen. Thus was she named for the legendary queen Durdina, the only one to whom Paksa ever bowed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mayaman

No few monks went missing in the bygone days when solitary ablutions in the Font of Maya were a popular form of devotion. Locals have come to offer their prayers for these wayward souls to the Mayaman─presumably while keeping a respectful distance from this caiman grown large on the font's nutritional boons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Chlorophos Deathworm

Per Loporrit sources, little can compare to the experience of gazing into silent subterranean waters to see this massive, writhing worm casting a sickly glow. They likely have the sunken spores of proximal fungi to thank for the unique experience, though the scientific community has been slow to verify this hypothesis.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Starscale Ephemeris

Due to its particular sensitivity to even the most minor magnetic fluctuations, this starscale charts its school's orbit with the utmost precision. Its fellows are only too eager to follow, for the slightest deviation might mean their end.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
E.B.E.-852738

If we take at face value the assertion that the E.B.E.-9318s are observational appendages of extra-dimensional entities, then perhaps it follows that this anomaly, with its unusually large and unblinking “eye,” is of even greater use in observing the phenomena of our cosmos. Or perhaps this theory, too, reflects our terrifyingly limited perspective.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ossicula

Replete with tiny bones equally visible whether the specimen is fresh or has lain desiccated waiting for a researcher to “get round to it” for moons, this fish also contains nutrients that may help rebuild cartilage, promising another experimental salvo in science's ceaseless war against lower back pain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kitty Herring

Toothsome and high in protein, this herring is one of the few wavekin guaranteed to satisfy the refined palates of Garlemald's domesticated cats─once it has been prepared for convenient consumption by doting hands. Needless to say, such strategies have figured prominently in the reconstruction effort.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarikuyruk

Named for the saffron shading of its tail, this nutritious wavekin is considered an effective bulwark against progressive vision loss. Though this claim has been verified by the Faculty of Medicine, experts emphasize that the consumption of great quantities will not result in powers of sight exceeding typical mortal limits.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stargilt Lobster

Despite its resemblance to gold leaf, the coating on a stargilt lobster's carapace serves the practical purpose of protection amidst the odd aetherial eddies of its habitat. Should one boil the creature like a common lobster, the coating will dissolve and lend the flesh a complex flavor─as will the knowledge of contributing to the extinction of a dead star's few survivors.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deadwood Shadow

This wavekin's ebon scales are reminiscent of the Greatwood's subaquatic sentinels. It drifts amongst the lightless depths like a submerged branch, swiftly sinking its teeth into the flesh of unsuspecting prey.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ronkan Bullion

Some assert that this hulking fish is one of the lost treasures of Ronka, transformed into a living creature by ancient magicks. Regardless of the tale's veracity, it is unlikely that this wavekin could return to its original form by the hands of an amateur─only descendants of Ronkan priests can perform the necessary rites to do so.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Golding

The flat, golden scales of this fish resemble a scattering of gold coins from the water's surface. Those greedy few who mistake it as such, however, will find themselves dragged into the depths before they can claim the false fortune as their own.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Bounty

On a visit to Il Mheg, the Crystal Exarch spotted a fish whose cerulean hues resembled the seas of his homeland. Fascinated by his tale, the people of the Crystarium began to refer to this wavekin as the little Bounty, that they might one day gaze upon the creature for themselves and reminisce on the vivid colors of their long-lost seas.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Saint Fathric's Face

Saint Fathric was once a household name in the Kingdom of Voeburt, famed for his abnormally strict and lengthy acts of penance. Though the kingdom he served lies in ruins, his name lives on through this wavekin, whose rock-solid head remains as unbreakable as the saint's stubborn will.
