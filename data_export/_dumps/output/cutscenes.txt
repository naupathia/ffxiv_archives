**URIANGER:** Now then... 'Tis I. The situation may be more complicated than we anticipated.

**YUGIRI:** Indeed. I shall remain watchful. Ere thou goest─another matter requireth thine attention. A young maiden, full eager to─ Wherefore inquirest thou of her fairness!? Very well. Be she damsel or devil, I shall direct her steps to Revenant's Toll. ...Save thine insinuations for one given to such impropriety. Thou shalt not find me amenable.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Far across the sea, from the land of Doma, have we traveled. We seek audience with the ruler of these lands. Who here speaks for you? We have traveled some several thousand malms across the sea, from the nation of Doma, in hopes that we might find sanctuary in these lands.

**YUGIRI:** Sanctuary, Lady Yugiri?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye. Lying within Othard, Doma was under the dominion of the Garlean Empire, as I am sure you are aware. When the war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we espied an opportunity to free ourselves from the yoke of imperial oppression, and took up arms. ...Only to be crushed. And so I gathered what few Domans escaped the reckoning, and guided them hither to your shores.

**YUGIRI:** A war of succession...? Then the Emperor... Forgive me, you said that Doma “was” under imperial rule, did you not?

**ALPHINAUD:** Doma is gone. Razed to the ground as an example to the other provinces.

**YUGIRI:** Twelve have mercy... And your people?

**ALPHINAUD:** On a ship anchored in Vesper Bay, flying borrowed colors. Many were complicit in the rebellion, or are kin to those who were. They will not come ashore until I send word that it is safe to do so. I sought an audience with your rulers, but was summarily refused.

**YUGIRI:** The lords of Ul'dah are not wont to entertain foreign refugees without suitable encouragement.

**ALPHINAUD:** Mayhap I was foolish to expect otherwise. But our supplies run low, and we have young ones in urgent need of care. I have seen the tents outside the gates, however. We are not the first to seek asylum, nor will we be the last.

**YUGIRI:** ...Be that as it may, Ul'dah is no friend to Garlemald. Your tale would stir the hearts of many men and women here. The sultana and the Syndicate will not be so easily swayed─but I shall see that you are granted an opportunity to plead your case.

**ALPHINAUD:** This is within your power?

**YUGIRI:** Well...far be it from me to boast, but I do have the ear of certain influential individuals.

**ALPHINAUD:** I am in your debt.

**YUGIRI:** Lady Yugiri, forgive me for observing, but...your choice of attire seems like to evoke feelings of mistrust.

**ALPHINAUD:** Men are wont to fear the unfamiliar. We know this from experience. We seek only to spare the people of Ul'dah unnecessary disquiet.

**YUGIRI:** I shall defer to your experience, then.

**ALPHINAUD:** I thank you for your understanding.

**YUGIRI:** It seems I have urgent business with the Flame General. I leave our guests in your capable hands.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I, Yugiri of Doma, am honored to meet you at last, Your Grace. To mark this auspicious occasion, I should like to present to you the finest treasures our humble nation has to offer... Alas, the circumstances which have brought me here today have divested me of both time and dignity. I come before you as a pauper in direst need of aid─to request that you grant my people asylum.

**YUGIRI:** I, Nanamo, seventeenth in the line of Ul, welcome you to our city. Be at ease, Lady Yugiri. Although I myself have heard the tale of your misfortune, I would ask that you recount it once more for the benefit of the others here present.

**RAUBAHN:** As you wish, Your Grace. For many years, my nation, Doma, suffered under the yoke of imperial rule, and my people yearned to be free. Thus, when a war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we sought to take advantage of the chaos and reclaim our liberty. Alas, our enemy proved less preoccupied than we had hoped, and our rebellion was put down in the most brutal fashion.

**YUGIRI:** Those who survived─how many do they number?

**RAUBAHN:** More than two hundred souls huddle within the cramped confines of our own galleon's hold. Yet this figure accounts for but one of a number of ships which escaped the purge. It is my hope that you will allow us all to dwell within your walls. Should that prove unfeasible, however, I humbly ask that you accept as many of my people as your resources allow. Pray understand, we do not beg a boon, but propose instead an arrangement. We would serve─as soldiers or tradesmen─until our debt is repaid.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** What are the Syndicate's opinions on this matter?

**ALPHINAUD:** I, for one, think it's a marvelous idea. Lady Yugiri and her people strike me as an industrious lot, and there are parts of the city which have yet to be fully restored. If they are willing to work, I see no reason not to let them.

**RAUBAHN:** The head of the Mirage Trust is not known for his generosity. He sees profit in this.

**LOLORITO:** I agree. That said, these are foreign refugees. To admit them would require a formal resolution. Shall we call a vote?

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** The law is the law.

**LOLORITO:** Lord Lolorito?

**ALPHINAUD:** Tell me: are you blind or willfully ignorant? Even now, our streets are choked with the displaced victims of the Calamity and Ala Mhigan refugees. They live hand-to-mouth, subsisting on aid provided by the Immortal Flames─the cost of which grows ever higher! The wealth of Ul'dah is not without limits, my friends. And need I remind you that these refugees are prone to violence and criminal activity? You have all read the reports, I think? Without homes or employment, it is only a matter of time before men grow desperate and take that which they imagine has been unjustly denied them. Yet, knowing this, you would have us swell their ranks. Mayhap you think the Brass Blades and the Flames are not hard-pressed enough?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Some say the chairman of the East Aldenard Trading Company passes gil thrice daily. This may explain how he came to be the wealthiest man in Ul'dah. Or it may simply be that he's ruthless beyond reckoning.

**LOLORITO:** Surely the sultanate can support the few hundred Domans Lady Yugiri represents? That our resources have been taxed I do not deny, but we are hardly in danger of financial collapse. I move that an exception be made.

**RAUBAHN:** An exception, Your Grace? I am suddenly reminded of a similar debate some years ago, regarding a number of Ala Mhigan refugees, if memory serves. What were your words that day? Ah, yes: “The law is the law.” And so our visitors remained in Little Ala Mhigo. Mayhap our wise and benevolent sultana would be so good as to enlighten us as to which other of our laws should not be upheld?

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** Mind your tongue, Lolorito.

**LOLORITO:** My lord, I share your concern for the welfare of our great nation, but we must endeavor to take a longer view. You know as well as I that people can be a resource still more precious than gil.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** Precious or not, they were never yet so reliable. And unlike those who frequent your establishment, I have no desire to gamble with my future. Ul'dah's greatest asset is, and has ever been, her material wealth. We risk this at our peril. One need only look to Teledji Adeledji's example for evidence of the danger in allowing sentiment to dictate policy. How far the vaunted Mirage hath fallen, both in repute and profitability, since he began employing refugees...

**RAUBAHN:** How I choose to conduct my affairs is not your concern, my lord!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** A proposal has been tabled. Given its urgency, I move we forgo further debate and call a vote. To accept the Doman refugees or not. Those in favor, I bid you remain. Those opposed, I bid you leave.

**YUGIRI:** Would that it were within my power to welcome you and your people, Lady Yugiri. As you have observed, however, my authority in such matters is regrettably limited. Without the consent of the Syndicate, I cannot act.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** I understand, Your Grace. And I appreciate all that you have done on our behalf.

**RAUBAHN:** The nerve of the man... If that bastard had not forsaken the eastern trade route, Little Ala Mhigo would now be thriving. That you should have traveled so far, under such dire circumstances, only to be refused in this manner is utterly unconscionable. Pray accept my sincerest apologies.

**THANCRED:** Now that the Empire no longer poses an immediate threat, they see little reason to maintain the pretense of unity. The Monetarists have grown especially defiant of late─Lord Lolorito most of all. But this is neither the time nor place for that discussion.

**YSHTOLA:** How goes the fishing? Caught anything slippery?

**THANCRED:** Aye. Our suspicions were well founded. The Serpent Reavers are indeed the culprits.

**YSHTOLA:** The plot thickens...

**THANCRED:** Has there been any movement in Thanalan?

**YSHTOLA:** It has been blessedly quiet. Which is to say the Amalj'aa are being no more or less of a nuisance than usual, summoning Ifrit with such crystals as they have hoarded. Urianger, too, reports naught out of the ordinary.

**MINFILIA:** Then we have our explanation.

**YSHTOLA:** Your explanation for what, pray tell?

**MINFILIA:** For the recent spate of crystal thefts in Thanalan. We naturally assumed that the trail would lead us back to the Amalj'aa. Yet it did not. It led us across the sea unto Vylbrand.

**YSHTOLA:** Vylbrand...? There *have* been reports of increased Sahagin activity of late... Oh gods...they mean to summon Leviathan?

**MINFILIA:** That is the way of it, I fear. Whilst conducting our investigation on behalf of the Mineral Concern, we came upon evidence implicating the Serpent Reavers. With the aid of the Maelstrom, I was able to verify our suspicions. 'Tis only a matter of time before Leviathan returns to harrow the seas. But there is more. One of the Sahagin─an elder, by my judgment─spoke of attaining the “gift and knowledge of eternity.”

**YSHTOLA:** <moan>

**WUUR:** Such a disturbance in the aether... If I did not know better, I should think this device defective. And there is the explanation...

**YSHTOLA:** Soon! Sssoon it shall begin! Our Lord shall rise 'midst sssurging waves to wash away the finless ones! And I shall be granted the gift and knowledge of eternity, and with the emissary ssstand equal! Then shall I know no cesssation, no oblivion!

**MINFILIA:** ...Whence comes this promise of immortality? The emissary? We have outstayed our welcome.

**YSHTOLA:** “The gift...and knowledge.”

**MINFILIA:** Are the two of you quite well?

**YSHTOLA:** You...you shared that vision, did you not? Even before the Sahagin made mention of the emissary, I recognized Elidibus's words. *He* is behind this. But surely it is not within his power to grant the Echo?

**MINFILIA:** My lady─unless we act swiftly, Leviathan will rise again. The Admiral has already requested that we intervene to prevent this. Failing that, we are to attend to the primal's extermination.

**THANCRED:** She will have our full cooperation. Let us make haste to Limsa Lominsa. I mean to play a part in this mission. Tataru─pray take charge in my absence.

**MINFILIA:** My lady, are you sure this is wise?

**THANCRED:** I am aware of the risks. But there is something I must see with mine own eyes. ...The true nature of the Echo.

**MINFILIA:** Very well. I shall not stand in your way...on the condition that you permit me to accompany you as bodyguard.

**YUGIRI:** Your company is ever welcome, Thancred.

**YSHTOLA:** I take it something ill is afoot?

**YUGIRI:** Aye. A primal is about to be loosed upon Eorzea.

**YSHTOLA:** A...primal?

**YUGIRI:** A godlike being whose very existence is a bane upon the land. We Scions of the Seventh Dawn are sworn to put an end to their kind.

**YSHTOLA:** I see. Know then that I am learned in the arts of war. In return for the kindness you have shown my people, I would lend you my blade.

**THANCRED:** It would be most welcome. When contending with a primal, one can never have too many able allies. If you crave a more intimate understanding of the problems facing Eorzea, this experience is like to provide it. Be sure to come well prepared. Damn them... They have made thralls of soldiers and civilians both...

**YUGIRI:** Did I miss much?

**THANCRED:** Hah. Yah.

**YUGIRI:** So that is how you fight in the Far East? Mental note: pick no quarrel with Domans. But seriously: if I am to keep up, I must needs forsake elegance for efficiency. Yah. Hah.

**THANCRED:** Hmmm...

**MERLWYB:** To the aetheryte!

**THANCRED:** You'll forgive me my lateness.

**WUUR:** I've been something of a liability of late, I know. 'Tis high time I set about making amends.

**MERLWYB:** Pshhh! Long have you shriveled shhhorewalkers tormented our kind! But no more! Your time is at an end! You shall perish with sssalt in your wounds and sssea in your lungs! Lord of the Whorl, hearken to our plea!
Lord of the Whorl, deliver us from our misery!

**MINFILIA:** Do you feel that!?

**MERLWYB:** I know this sensation... It's the Echo!

**WUUR:** What!?

**MERLWYB:** Pshhh! Sssuch power! It is...*transcendent*!

**WUUR:** Seven hells...

**MERLWYB:** Pshhhahahahahaaa! Ssstrike me down if you will! It is futile! I have massstered the gift! I am...*eternal*! O mighty Leviathan, ruler of the ssseas, born of waters primordial! I offer unto You this frail fleshhh, that You might grant Your faithful servants deliverance! I beseech You! Come forth!

**WUUR:** Die, damn you!

**YUGIRI:** Foolishhh shorewalker! You cannot kill that which is eternal!

**MERLWYB:** Heavens forfend...

**WUUR:** Damn it all!

**MINFILIA:** Pshhh!? My being...ebbs away... B-But it should by rightsss be infinite! Am I not...immortal? Curse you, Emissary! You promised me...everlasssting... Pshhh...

**MERLWYB:** Wh-Where did he go!?

**YSHTOLA:** What say you? Nary a single ship!? Hells take that sea demon! Gather the survivors and get to shore. Leave the wrecks for the pirates. Leviathan wastes no time. The diversionary squadron is lost. For a mercy, 'twould seem the primal now makes for open sea. But why does he not press his advantage? Unless... Gods save us, he means to unleash a tidal wave! There used to be a hamlet beyond South Tidegate in western La Noscea. Halfstone, 'twas called. Some years prior to the Maelstrom's founding, Leviathan rose from the briny depths, and set about unleashing watery hell upon us. On that occasion, the Company of Heroes put him down before he could do too much damage. But when the bastard came next, this time in the wake of the Calamity, we were not so fortunate. Weary of ravaging our shoreline, he summoned a tidal wave which fair leveled Halfstone, and washed the soil away for good measure.

**MERLWYB:** The area was subsequently occupied by the Sahagin.

**THANCRED:** Aye, the thrice-damned creatures transformed it into a spawning ground for their brood. Given the quantity of crystals stolen to feed him and his legion of thralls, we can be fairly sure that Leviathan is stronger now than in his previous incarnations. If that sea demon is left to wreak havoc, what befell Halfstone may well befall a larger settlement─even Limsa. That *cannot* happen. The primal must be stopped.

**MERLWYB:** That was ever our objective, Admiral. But how are we to achieve it? The sea is Leviathan's uncontested domain. The ships of the Third Squadron could not close to within a hundred yalms of the primal, nor could their cannons pierce his defenses.

**YSHTOLA:** I have read the reports, Master Thancred. Our warships may as well have been bloody pleasure barges for all the good they did. Seven hells... Is there no way that we might strike back?

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** The Company of Heroes defeated Leviathan having first lured him into an inlet, but we must needs contend with him upon the open sea. It will avail us little to consult past experience.

**MERLWYB:** Admiral, if I may.

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** Speak freely, Marshal.

**MINFILIA:** By all accounts, Leviathan's most formidable weapon is the very sea itself. Waves and whirlpools, tides and currents─all these things are his to command. The key to victory, I believe, lies in disarming our foe. This, in effect, is what the Company of Heroes achieved with their ruse. We cannot lure Leviathan from the sea a second time, but what if we could weaken his hold upon the element of water? I have heard of devices capable of such wonders. They draw upon the power of corrupted crystals, I am told. If mounted upon a ship, such a device might be used to prevent Leviathan from bringing the full force of the sea to bear against us, rendering him no more dangerous than any other sea serpent.

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** Of course... Cid built a similar device to grant the *Enterprise* safe passage through Garuda's tempest, did he not?

**MERLWYB:** Begging your pardon, my lady, but to give credit where it's due, this is something I heard from an old arcanist friend of mine.

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** It makes little difference who thought of it first, so long as it works. Beg the specifications of this device from your friend, and I shall pass them on to our people at Naldiq & Vymelli's. But before we proceed any further, I would voice one concern: piercing Garuda's defenses is one thing, suppressing Leviathan's attacks quite another. In matters of science, I am as a babbling babe, but I cannot well imagine that such a feat would be possible without a veritable mountain of corrupted crystals. The question being: do we have a ship big enough to bear such a burden?

**MERLWYB:** Mayhap not, Admiral. But two might. Recall you the tale of Mistbeard's greatest haul? It is said that he lashed two ships together, side by side, the better to bear his plunder. By your leave, we might attempt to repeat the trick. The gods know, it would be quicker than building a new vessel.

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** Mistbeard did this? Truly, Marshal, upon the subject of the pirate king, you are as a scholar.

**MERLWYB:** Now, from what I have gleaned of these matters, the device will need to be in close and constant proximity to the target. To wit, we must lash our twin vessel to Leviathan. This in itself will be no small feat. Ramming speed will be required, but given the weight of the cargo, that will only be attainable with the aid of a towing vessel... Suffice it to say, the task of piloting said vessel will entail considerable danger, and I would not ask it of another. I volunteer myself.

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** 'Twill be dangerous for all involved...but we have no better recourse. Very well. Commodore. Assemble the remnants of the fleet at Moraby Bay. Give priority to our soundest vessels. The repairs can wait. Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn, command of the operation is yours. I want that twin vessel ready to sail posthaste.

**MERLWYB:** At once, Admiral!

**YUGIRI:** And then there is the small matter of slaying the beast... The fate of Limsa Lominsa rests upon your shoulders once again. Go well, Warrior of Light. We Lominsans are sworn to strive “Till sea swallows all”─and swallow all it would have, had Leviathan prevailed. That we still strive now, we owe in no small part to you. Not for the first time, you have delivered Limsa Lominsa from the wrath of a primal. Never has our nation known a stouter ally. On behalf of my people, I give you my humblest thanks. 'Tis meet that I give thanks to old Mistbeard, too, for his fine solution. Whatever else he may have been, 'tis clear he was a resourceful soul. Would that I had a man like him in my service.

**MERLWYB:** Before I set foot in these lands, I had no inkling that the people of Eorzea contended with such mighty foes. Suffice it to say, their existence came as something of a shock─as did the idea that they could be defeated. This experience has served to remind me of the vastness of the world...and the boundless potential of man. Though I am but a refugee in this realm, I would fain be of use to you in your fight. Know that I am tutored in one of the foremost combat arts of the Far East. It may seem...outlandish to the Eorzean eye, but should any of your people care to learn, I would be pleased to initiate them.

**THANCRED:** And I will see to it that they are grateful. I have no doubt that your knowledge and skills will serve us well. Besides, your art is not so outlandish as you think. Would you not agree, Master Thancred?

**YUGIRI:** Naught escapes your searching eye, Admiral. Few are privy to this information, but Limsa Lominsa is home to a certain...secret fraternity. Its members are trained in a form of combat not unlike your own. By my judgment, it should not be beyond such individuals to adapt to the techniques I witnessed you employing with such admirable deftness.

**THANCRED:** I am heartened to hear this. I, too, noted a kinship between your style and mine own. Though it seemed to me that you fought differently in the beginning.

**YSHTOLA:** A-Aye, I suppose I did... What can I say? I am a man of many talents. Hahaha...

**THANCRED:** Though you may labor to believe it, Thancred was once something of a scoundrel, who fraternized with the criminal class in these parts.

**MINFILIA:** Y-Y'shtola! You jest, of course!

**THANCRED:** But for a chance encounter with Alphinaud's grandsire, he might never have left Limsa Lominsa; or received an education in Sharlayan; or taken up his post in Ul'dah─which is where he trained in the blade, lest you wonder.

**YUGIRI:** Minfilia─please!

**MERLWYB:** It would seem there is more to you than meets the eye, Master Thancred.

**YUGIRI:** Lady Yugiri─I am told that you and yours came to Eorzea seeking permanent resettlement, and that many Domans have since been engaged as frontier hands at Revenant's Toll. Mor Dhona is many things, but a place of refuge it is not. Know that I would like nothing better than to furnish your people with a new home here on Lominsan soil. Alas, racked by instability as we are, our nation is in no fit state to take you in. Yet I'll not have it said that we turned a blind eye to your suffering. Until such time as we can do more, I pledge to send provisions.

**MERLWYB:** We are in your debt, Admiral. I realize that it scarce qualifies as repayment, but if it please you, I shall set about sharing my martial knowledge with your people at once.

**YSHTOLA:** You wished a word in private.

**MERLWYB:** The better not to spoil the festive mood. History repeats itself, Admiral. As the kobolds did before them, the Sahagin resorted to summoning their god over a territorial feud. They acted in self-preservation. It may be that the Sahagin initiated this particular clash, but how it begins does not interest me so much as how it ends.

**YSHTOLA:** I have not forgotten our conversation, Y'shtola. I am aware that man bears part of the blame for the primals' existence. Nor am I ignorant of the Sahagin's reason for acting. They sought to secure a place to breed and multiply, that their kind might survive. Self-preservation, as you say. But we have as much right to live and thrive as they. If our own survival is threatened, are we to lay down our arms and welcome oblivion? Nay.

**MERLWYB:** And so you kill, that you might live. Yet if living is a right, then that right belongs to all peoples, be they men or beastmen.

**YSHTOLA:** I'll not deny your reasoning. But when a storm gathers, it falls to me to see my people safely through it. That is my duty, and I shall do it.

**YUGIRI:** As must we all, Admiral. Stay the course, then, but know that it will lead to no good end.

**MERLWYB:** Man has ever put himself first and foremost. To justify his actions, he clads himself in the armor of righteousness─though it be a fancy of his own making. In this, mayhap the Garleans and we Domans are not so different...

**MINFILIA:** Eorzea has become as a raging sea. If we are to keep our heads above the waves, we cannot scruple to drown the man next to us. When hopes of coexistence founder, strength must determine who has the greater right to live.

**URIANGER:** I have been reflecting upon the events which took place during our visit to Vylbrand. If you have a moment, I would share my conclusions with you. Please bear with me. When the Sahagin elder summoned Leviathan, he employed the power we have come to know as the Echo. Though I cannot well explain the how of it, it would seem he became immortal in so doing. When the Admiral subsequently slew him, his spirit emerged from his lifeless flesh, a consciousness shorn of physical form. Thus transfigured, he took up residence in the body of his minion with the ease of a man donning a favorite glove. Long have I known that the Echo allows one to pass through the walls of a man's soul. But never did I imagine that it could free us from our own flesh, nor less that our souls could then occupy the next corporeal vessel to take our fancy. It was of this that Elidibus spoke─an existence which knows neither cessation nor oblivion. And yet, though the Sahagin had mastered his gift and thereby become immortal, he was by no means invulnerable. As we both bore witness, he was ultimately absorbed into Leviathan. And the import of this observation? If the Ascians' mode of existence is indeed the same, it can be inferred that they, too, are not invulnerable─that they *can* be destroyed. There exists a legend which tells of souls who are reborn upon the cusp of each Umbral Calamity, that they might stay the encroaching Darkness. To most, it is but a faerie tale, yet recent events have given me cause to wonder: could the legend in fact refer to the Echo? Much and more yet remains unknown, but I am confident that all will become clear in time. For the present, however, what matters is that the key to defeating the Ascians may at last be within sight. With Urianger's aid, it is my hope that I shall fathom this matter ere long. Ah! I was just about to send for you, my friend.
...Is aught amiss?

**MINFILIA:** Grave tidings from the Sharlayan motherland, my lady. It doth concern our distant allies, the Students of Baldesion.

**URIANGER:** What of them?

**MINFILIA:** My lady...the Isle of Val, which for many years hath been the order's home, is no more.

**URIANGER:** No more? Whatever do you mean?

**MINFILIA:** I relate only that which hath been conveyed unto me by our agents. An aetheric wave of the highest magnitude was recorded in the region. Soon thereafter, 'twas observed that the isle had ceased to be. 'Tis postulated that a magick was evoked, like in power to Ultima.

**LOLORITO:** Twelve preserve...

**FOLLOWEROFTELEDJI:** If there are no other matters, I move that today's meeting be adjourned.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** It is done, my lord. I... <cough> F-Forgive my impertinence, my lord, but these orders... I am uncertain as to what end they serve.

**GILGAMESH:** Revolution.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**RAUBAHN:** Come, you must have gathered by now that Tataru is given to exaggeration. As you can see, I am quite well. Ul'dah, on the other hand, is not. This riot was anything but an isolated incident. There is a restlessness in the air. Tensions long simmering are at last threatening to boil over. Ul'dah is a nation infamous for the great disparity between the wealthy and the poor. The majority of the populace accepts this state of affairs because they believe that every man bears responsibility for his own lot in life. To an Ul'dahn, money is the foremost─and some would say the *only*─measure of a man's worth. Small wonder that the wealthiest wield the greatest influence. So where do the refugees fit into this social hierarchy? What place is there for those who fled Ala Mhigo and the destruction of the Calamity? Plainly, there *is* none. They have no wealth, no power, and no worth. To the Ul'dahn way of thinking, they may as well not exist. Choosing to ignore their existence, however, is patently not an option. General Raubahn and the sultana understand this, which is why they ordered the Immortal Flames to provide the refugees aid and succor. Yet none would dispute that the expenses incurred by this policy grow by the day, with no end in sight. This has prompted more and more Ul'dahns to question their obligation to aid these worthless wanderers...  While more and more refugees have come to resent their treatment at the hands of the sneering citizenry. The manner of Lord Lolorito's refusal to grant the Domans asylum bespoke a disdain for all refugees─an attitude shared by the rest of the Monetarists. And you may be sure they make no effort to conceal their opinions. It was only a matter of time before the refugees united in protest. Nor is it any surprise that some among them would ultimately resort to violence. That the Immortal Flames should choose this of all occasions to engage in joint training exercises with the other Grand Companies... By the time they return, the situation may well have deteriorated beyond mending.

**ALPHINAUD:** Commander Swift has kept us apprised of your recent activities. You've made great strides towards quelling the violence.

**RAUBAHN:** Despite our best efforts to determine what provoked this uprising, the truth continues to elude us. Have you uncovered aught which might shed some light on the mystery?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** This information does not leave this room. The Syndicate's decision to reject the Doman refugees' appeal for asylum had lasting repercussions. A number of those displaced by the Calamity claimed it was proof of a policy of discrimination. Together with a group of Ala Mhigan refugees, they organized a series of demonstrations to protest against the sultanate. Demonstrations which became heated, but did not descend into violence.  Until a certain incident served as a call to arms.

**RAUBAHN:** A unit of Brass Blades sent to supervise a demonstration loosed arrows upon unarmed protesters. It was this atrocity which prompted the refugees to take up arms. I need not tell you what followed.

**ALPHINAUD:** We assumed at first that the attack was born of a miscommunication. When emotions run high, they happen. But suspicions were raised regarding the unit's commanding officer, whom I ordered interrogated. Sure enough, our fears were soon confirmed. The dog confessed that a merchant had offered him coin to give the order─a merchant in the employ of Teledji Adeledji.

**RAUBAHN:** Teledji Adeledji? But he spoke in favor of the Domans' cause, and has ever seemed sympathetic towards the refugees' plight. Why would he do such a thing?

**ALPHINAUD:** Know you of the Carteneau Reclamation Bill? It is a proposal to annex the Carteneau Flats so that refugees may establish permanent settlements.

**RAUBAHN:** When last I looked, that was disputed territory.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Aye. Some might even call it a battlefield. The destruction wrought by Bahamut was greatest at the Carteneau Flats. That much is common knowledge. What is less well known is that his rampage laid bare ancient Allagan ruins, of which no record existed. There are certain...differences of opinion as to how these ruins should be handled, which is why each nation maintains a military presence in the region to this day. Yet differ though we may, we are still allies. Therefore, in the interest of preserving the Eorzean Alliance, we have reached an agreement. Any conflict which may arise during the course of military exercises in the region shall have no bearing on relations between our nations. In full knowledge of this delicate state of affairs, Teledji Adeledji proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill. A shameless bloody ruse which stands to benefit him in but one conceivable way. If successful, he will gain control over the disputed territory, under the guise of assisting in the resettlement effort. And you can be sure he'll build an orphanage next to every Allagan ruin.

**RAUBAHN:** The man would threaten the unity of the Eorzean Alliance and risk countless lives for personal gain!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** He walks a path all his own, independent of any faction, and beholden to none of his fellows on the Syndicate.

**ALPHINAUD:** By inciting the less fortunate to violence, he hopes to convince others that the Carteneau Reclamation Bill is the only viable solution. His sympathy for the plight of the Domans was naught but posturing to gain credibility with the refugees. Of that there can be no doubt.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Forgive me, but what could possibly motivate Teledji Adeledji to go to such lengths? What is so special about these ruins that he would risk his position on the Syndicate, and, most likely, charges of treason against the sultanate?

**ALPHINAUD:** Omega...

**RAUBAHN:** Pardon?

**ALPHINAUD:** An Allagan monstrosity, not unlike the Ultima Weapon. Mayhap larger. We know not. It has yet to be fully excavated. Allagan inscriptions indicate that it was created to fell Bahamut himself. If accurate, it might explain why Nael van Darnus chose to bring the red moon down upon the Carteneau Flats. Given the ends he went to to ensure Eorzea's annihilation, destroying the one weapon which could stay the elder primal may well have seemed like good sense.

**RAUBAHN:** When first I bore witness to the power of the Ultima Weapon, I doubted the evidence of my senses... And now you tell me there is another such weapon─one which could contend with Bahamut. *Bahamut*.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Aye. We were skeptical ourselves. Truth be told, until the Ultima Weapon's existence came to light, we thought the inscription had been mistranslated.

**RAUBAHN:** At present, Omega is more akin to a fossil than a tool of war, having long since ceased to function. As such, its true potential cannot accurately be gauged. However, if someone were to restore it, as the Garleans did the Ultima Weapon, I have little doubt that he would wield untold power.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Power enough to subjugate Ul'dah, like as not, and the rest of Eorzea besides─which is doubtless why Teledji Adeledji yearns to have it.

**RAUBAHN:** That *he* should aspire to world domination... He who has ever walked two paces behind Lord Lolorito in matters of commerce.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** 'Tis in acknowledgement of his own limitations that he seeks this power. Woe betide us all should we allow him to have it.

**ALPHINAUD:** Pray waste no time chasing rats. Only a fool would believe that secrets can be kept in Ul'dah.

**HAURCHEFANT:** It would seem the implications of the sultanate's refugee problem are rather more far-reaching than we assumed...

**YSAYLE:** The incident with the new frontier hands? No, no, you need not elaborate─I have been following their progress with no small amount of interest. Brave men and women all... They do our nation a great service. The existence of a fortified outpost in Mor Dhona will do much to dissuade the Empire from trespassing on Coerthan soil. Right glad am I that you have chosen to lend your support to this endeavor. Never let it be said that House Fortemps does not acknowledge the efforts of her allies...or her debts. 'Twas in the spirit of gratitude that I arranged for sundry supplies to be delivered to Revenant's Toll. That the shipment should chance to be waylaid by heretics is poor fortune, indeed. Poor fortune, I say...yet not without precedent. If you would know the truth of it, these incorrigible villains grow more organized with each passing day. This new unity of purpose we attribute to their leader─the Lady “Iceheart.” But though I have devoted significant resources to the task of identifying this woman, we have yet to learn so much as her birth name. What we *do* know is that the heretics speak of Iceheart in reverent tones, and would gladly embrace death rather than betray her. Such loyalty is rare indeed, and I fear to imagine what so committed a collective might achieve. The brigands have not yet been so brazen as to risk direct confrontation here in Dragonhead. Some few of their number have, however, been sighted not far to the west of here...and with ever-increasing regularity. A visit to Whitebrim Front may bring you the answers you seek. Will you brave the snows knowing what implacable foes may lie in wait? Halone's blessings be upon you! Though I take no pride in the admission, many of mine own countrymen are not so well suited as you adventurers to dealing with such foes. Were they dragons, it might be otherwise! But truly, I could not wish for a finer ally. You have done much for my house in the past, and I have no doubt but that I shall have cause to celebrate your deeds again ere long. Should you learn aught of value, pray return to me forthwith. A warm hearth and a warmer welcome shall be waiting for you.

**HAURCHEFANT:** (-???-)Hmph...

**KANESENNA:** Your return is most timely. Of their own accord, my thoughts had turned to your task and the progress thereof. I confess, my imaginings tended toward the grim and bloody. But you are here now, and I suspect such frivolous wonderings do little justice to the reality of your travails. Tell me, what did you learn of Iceheart? ...Indeed. And this transpired at Snowcloak? Of all the highlands, that towering wall has borne the worst of the region's brutal shift in climate. So inhospitable has Snowcloak become that we have still to survey the area in its entirety. Could its frozen heights conceal the heretics' hideaway? Mayhap a more robust reconnaissance effort is in order. Putting such considerations aside for the moment, we still know far too little of this Iceheart. That she is capable of commanding such a band of fanatics bespeaks natural authority, and no small measure of charisma. As much as I would like to fathom this mystery with you, the situation has grown beyond my personal purview. I am bound by duty to inform the Temple Knights and request that they bring this matter to its conclusion. Given the glowing reports their new commander has garnered thus far, I am certain that they can be relied upon to take appropriate action. Though Iceheart's true identity yet eludes us, you have provided us with a point from which to begin. Sometimes it takes but a single stone to prompt an avalanche. On the matter of the stolen provisions, I have already made arrangements for a second shipment to be sent to Revenant's Toll. I could not well allow such an honorable venture to be undermined by one miserable setback!

**RAMUH:** Scions of the Seventh Dawn, on behalf of the people of Gridania, I bid you welcome. Your presence is of great comfort to us all in these days of uncertainty. I summoned you here to share tidings of a most urgent nature. But a short while ago, the great elemental spoke, and his voice was clarion in its intensity: Ramuh is returned unto the forest. Scarce had his words ceased to echo in mine ears when we were visited by an emissary from Little Solace. Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin. Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin. Though his exact whereabouts remain unknown, we may safely assume that the primal was summoned within the heart of the Sylphlands. Unlike the other primals you have encountered, Lord Ramuh is no raging avatar of destruction. He is revered as much for his wisdom as his strength, serving as both arbiter and guardian to his children. Given that we and the sylphs found a way to share the Twelveswood, it is my hope that this sagely immortal will be amenable to reason, and that conflict may be avoided. Blessed as you are with the power of the Echo, you are one of the few among us who may commune with a primal without fear of influence. I would ask therefore that you represent us in this most delicate of negotiations. The Twelveswood has suffered enough. Upon this, we and the sylphs─and I would venture Lord Ramuh himself─are in perfect accord. Let us not endanger our shared home by engaging in unnecessary hostilities. Dear friend, I beseech you: safeguard the peace which exists between our peoples. You have my thanks. Pray make for Little Solace, then. A member of the Order of the Twin Adder awaits you there. He will advise you on how to find the Lord of Levin. An ill wind blows through the forest. Yet...it is not only the Twelveswood that flinches at its coming─all the lands of Eorzea shiver in dread anticipation. Have care.

**YSHTOLA:** Thine aura betrays thee, servant of Hydaelyn. Thou art the Bringer of Light...bane of Ifrit, Titan, Garuda, and Leviathan. I am Ramuh, guardian of the children of the forest. Thou tramplest upon sacred soil, Bringer of Light. By what right doth man intrude in this sanctuary of the sylphs? The Gridanians proffer peace? Their words are born of delusion─thine offer, an insult. Thou speakest of harmony, yet carest naught for my children's desires. They did but wish to dwell beneath these boughs in solitude─yet even that was too much to ask of man. Thus did they turn to me for succor. The sentence I pronounce upon thy kind is just. Gridanian or Garlean, it matters not. The good intent of one excuseth not the misdeeds of the other. Thy conflicts have brought naught but anguish and misery unto the forest. All blame doth lie with the darkness that resideth in the breast of man. Whence sprung this calamitous seed? In the beginning, no such duality existed. Were light and dark given form when man was born? It would explain much. Not least why strife and sorrow follow ever in thy wake. Thou canst not deny the urgings of thine own nature. Knowing that thy mere presence here portendeth tragedy, wilt thou persist in this pretense of peacemaking? Thou bearest the crystal which I bestowed upon my wayward charges. That they should entrust so precious a gift to thee... Thou standest apart from thy kin. Thou art the Bringer of Light, aye...but there is something more in thee... Very well, I shall consider thy proposal...shouldst thou survive my trial. If thou wouldst champion the cause of harmony, I must have proof that thou art fit to play the role. Weather mine ire, and prove to me thereby that thou hast strength enough to stay the Darkness which threateneth to consume thee. Yet if thou shouldst be found wanting, know that *all* men shall perish in the storm of my judgment! Come to me, Bringer of Light. I shall await thee on the field of battle!

**URIANGER:** Urianger. It is rare indeed to find you so far from a tome.

**RAMUH:** The Lord of Levin himself... Never till this day had I looked upon his visage save in painted renderings, made faint by time... Ever shall this scene remain etched in my mind's eye... Ahem. Beg pardon, my lady. I must beg thine aid on a point of research. If thou art resolved to face Lord Ramuh, I would ask thy leave to observe the event...

**URIANGER:** I have taken thy measure, Bringer of Light. And I judge thee a worthy champion. The task of excising the sin that hath taken root in man's heart is thine. Shrink not from employing thy strength in service to the forest, and the wider realm beyond. Like hungering shadows do the enemies of harmony gather, and meekness will but feed them. If man is to be delivered from the Dark, it shall be by thy guiding Light alone. Stray not from the path, for if thou dost, thy people shall be truly lost...

**KANESENNA:** Thou hast slain the Lord of Levin. A regrettable act...but a necessary one. In witnessing thy struggle, a truth hath been revealed unto me. If I mistake not, it may yet prove a chink in the eternal armor of the Ascians. But let us conclude our present business. I shall expound upon my findings at the Rising Stones anon.

**MINFILIA:** You are returned to us, dear friend, and none the worse for bearing the heavy burden which I did press upon you. Most glad am I of this. I am informed that your efforts to negotiate a peace with Lord Ramuh ended in conflict. Pray tell me, what befell? Ramuh made trial of you? I fear there is truth to his claim. It is the darkness within us that attracts the Darkness without. It cannot be denied that misfortune follows man. For evidence, one need only look to the conflict brewing in Carteneau, or to the rising flood of refugees. Our shared struggle against the Empire should have served to seal our union, yet the ties which bind the Alliance strain under the weight of gross self-interest. As the scars of the Calamity begin to fade, so too does our sense of common purpose. Yet now is scarce the time to forget our shared responsibility. If this new-sprung realm is to survive beyond its infancy, it must needs be nurtured by all. Eorzea *must* be as one. Yet I fear that dream is still far off. On behalf of the people of Gridania, and the elementals both, I thank you for all that you and your fellow Scions have done. Full oft have I been compelled to look to you for aid of late...and offered all too little in return. As leader of this nation, I shall endeavor to prove a more worthy ally to your cause henceforth. Lord Ramuh has departed, yet the keening of this ill wind grows no less insistent... Voices of the forest─pray speak and I shall listen. What unseen evil begets this unease in my heart?

**URIANGER:** If everyone is ready, let us begin. Urianger, the floor is yours.

**MINFILIA:** As all here assembled now know, in its final hours as our order's headquarters, the Waking Sands did play host to a most unexpected visitor. I speak of the Ascian clad in white, Elidibus. Unwelcome though his presence was, his words that day did serve to confirm a truth long suspected: that the Ascians are eternal beings, to whom physical destruction is as a temporary inconvenience.

**URIANGER:** In the intervening time, Urianger and I have striven to discover a means by which the Ascians might more permanently be slain.

**YSHTOLA:** And 'tis my belief that we have found the thread that will allow us to unravel the twisted skein of their existence. In the moments prior to Leviathan's most recent manifestation, the Sahagin elder who summoned him was observed to undergo some manner of ascension. The aetheric readings taken by Y'shtola at the time of this transfiguration have proven most enlightening.

**URIANGER:** The disruption to the flow of aether was sudden and dramatic. So tangible was the agitation, I scarce had need of my goggles.

**MINFILIA:** The significance of Y'shtola's readings might better be understood in the context of mine own, taken at the instant of the Lord of Levin's demise. Unlike the primal, the Sahagin was not subject to aetheric dissipation.

**URIANGER:** Before discussing our new discoveries, it may benefit us all to recall what we know of aetheric behavior. Let us begin at what some might call the end. When we who dwell in the material realm die, our spirits dissolve into the flow of aether, and are returned to the aetherial realm. In turn, the restless energy which suffuses that plane streams back into our world, giving rise to new life.

**MINFILIA:** 'Tis as the heavens did decree─the way of all mortal souls. 'Twixt this world and the next do the aetherial currents swirl, bearing the very essence of life. Thus doth the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth continue unabated.

**URIANGER:** Primals behave somewhat differently. In order to manifest and then maintain a physical presence in this realm, they must consume vast quantities of aether, most often in the form of crystals. Though they may seem to live, their flesh is but aether given shape. Thus, a defeated primal leaves behind no broken corpse─rather, the essence of its form seeps back into the land whence it came, and the energy of its shattered spirit is called back to the aetherial realm.

**MINFILIA:** And there it waiteth till next the prayers of the faithful do draw it forth from the sea of aether to take their offering of crystals and make for itself a new body...

**YSHTOLA:** Which brings us on to the third group. These so-called “immortals.” They exist in a manner all their own.

**URIANGER:** Quite. Even as the Sahagin elder fell to the Admiral's musket shot, I witnessed the release of an aetherial cloud which immediately took possession of a nearby minion.

**THANCRED:** A soul that dissipateth not upon the death of the flesh...

**MINFILIA:** The secret of life everlasting. And in the claws of a Sahagin, no less. But I wonder: what would happen to one of these obstinate spirits should there be no suitable host for it to claim?

**URIANGER:** If mortal death entails a return to the aetherial realm, it seems doubtful that the soul of an immortal would venture there.

**MINFILIA:** Nay, it merely withdraweth a distance. Unto the shore of the aetherial sea, perchance, but no further.

**THANCRED:** Yes, it exists in neither this realm nor the next, abiding instead in the space that lies between them. The Ascians took control of Thancred by means of a Crystal of Darkness─an artifact which, if our theories are correct, serves as a gateway to the place I have just described.

**MINFILIA:** I was hoping people had forgotten about that...

**URIANGER:** I am sorry, my friend.

**YSHTOLA:** For a mercy, the weary road of our research hath brought us unto an answer.

**URIANGER:** The Sahagin ascended to an immortal state, but he did not possess a Crystal of Darkness through which to flee this realm. Thus was he consumed by Leviathan. If we could entrap the spirits of defeated Ascians in like manner, and thereby deny them resurrection...

**MINFILIA:** Therein lieth the path to victory. Thou art most perceptive, my lady. Only when we have trapped the bodiless soul within an aetherial prison can we hope to defeat its unnatural constancy. Thus, might even an eternal Paragon be consigned to oblivion.

**URIANGER:** These feats are, of course, far easier said than done. At present, we lack a viable means to entrap and extinguish an Ascian soul. Yet I believe it to be possible. The pieces of the puzzle lie before us─we have but to put them together.

**MINFILIA:** I will depart at once to convene with the sages of Sharlayan. Together shall we divine the steps by which our goals may be achieved.

**URIANGER:** I have the utmost faith in you, Archon.

**MINFILIA:** Beg pardon, Antecedent, but I would raise one final matter... Even now, a Sharlayan survey party seeketh to ascertain the fate of the Students of Baldesion. Their findings shall soon be known to us. Though you harbor feelings of dread, I bid you surrender not to sorrow, but abide instead in hopeful prayer.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I shall, Archon. Thank you.

**RAUBAHN:** Tell me, General: what think you of Alphinaud's bold endeavor?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I think it is more than bold, Your Grace. His organization would pave the way for a united Eorzea. Well do I understand his impatience. Since facing the common threat of the Ultima Weapon, our nations have seemed farther apart, not closer together. Considering the many problems we face, should we not be glad that someone else is taking the initiative?

**RAUBAHN:** We have all pledged our cooperation, yet the grumbling continues behind closed doors. Ul'dah is not alone in her duplicity. I myself have doubts as to the good this organization will achieve. With the inclusion of the finest soldiers of the three Grand Companies, it promises to be a fearsome military body. But whom will it serve? Even under the watchful gaze of the Scions, it is not unthinkable that such a force could perpetrate a great wrong. Does it not concern you that a significant proportion of its financial backing came from the coffers of the Syndicate? That those unprincipled worms might forge this extraordinary gathering of warriors into a private army?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I have trust in the Scions, Your Grace. They have spared us no end of trouble at the hands of the primals. If they seek reinforcements, I deem it unwise to deny them. As for their finances, full many gave generously. And though our nobles proffered a sizable sum, their coin did not spill from the pockets of Lolorito and his cronies. And what of the presence of our stalwart adventurer friend in this endeavor? I doubt the Warrior of Light would betray our cause.

**RAUBAHN:** Yes, there is that, I suppose. Yet I have known people to change. Whether we will or no, the events of the age hurl us this way and that, like a dust devil skipping across the sands... Can naught be done about Teledji?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I have explored all avenues available to us, Your Grace, but as Ul'dahn law now stands, we lack the evidence to convict him of any crime. To arrest him on spurious grounds would only play into his hands...

**RAUBAHN:** He has all but committed treason, and yet we can do nothing!? Then what good our government!? What worth the royal house!? How deplorable this mockery of justice! This isn't the text you're looking for.

**ALPHINAUD:** Have faith, Your Grace. It is not over...

**ALL:** Comrades! Your presence here this day signifies the momentous choice that each of you has made. With your strength now pledged to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, you are beholden to no single nation. You stand as the vanguard for a united Eorzea! From this moment forth, I declare you Crystal Braves! Let us mend this fractured realm, and face our enemies as one! Whether it be the beastmen and their primals, or the conflict in Carteneau, it is plain that the nations of Eorzea cannot solve the problems which plague the realm. Thus does it fall to some few heroic souls to succeed where they have failed! Come! Take your place at the Scions' side as guardians of Eorzea! And together we shall fight for the freedom of all!

**MINFILIA:** (-Crystal Braves-)For the freedom of all!

**ALPHINAUD:** A rousing speech, Alphinaud. Or should I say, Crystal Brave Commander Leveilleur?

**MINFILIA:** Please, Antecedent...the title is honorary. I shall not be “leading the troops into battle,” as it were. We are of the same purpose. Let us join hands, and do what must be done to save this land.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**RAUBAHN:** Hail to you, Scion. How might we serve you? ...Commander Leveilleur bade you serve us? These are welcome tidings indeed. Given the sensitive nature of the task, I could not rely on one of my own. That which I am about to tell you, I tell you in the strictest confidence. Some days ago, we received certain documents from an anonymous source. They notified us of the presence of a Garlean agent within the ranks of one of the Grand Companies. Following some discreet inquiries, we identified a suspect among the Immortal Flames whom we detained for questioning. Alas, the man was not our agent. He was but one of many men in the agent's employ. We pressed the traitor for a name, but he had none to give. He claims never to have met his master, whom he knows only as the Ivy. He was, however, certain that this “ivy” had coiled itself around every part of the Immortal Flames. It would seem our quarry joined the company some time ago, and gradually recruited others to his cause. These conspirators are the vines by which he learns our secrets, all without exposing himself. It won't be easy to identify the Ivy amidst this tangled mass of subterfuge. But we have a tendril in our hands, and we shall follow it all the way to the gnarled root. Now, much as I would prefer to proceed with due discretion, circumstances demand that this matter be settled posthaste. Garlemald's war of succession nears its end, and it is feared that the Empire will soon resume its march on Eorzea. When it does, we can ill afford to have traitors in our midst. The Ivy must be rooted out now. We must begin by apprising General Raubahn of our findings. I would ask that you accompany me to the Hall of Flames, and remain on hand to see that things go smoothly. Assuming the Ivy's tendrils are as widespread as we believe, he will be aware that an investigation is underway. And if that is the case, he may well move against us. We must be prepared for anything, while taking care not to betray our purpose by *seeming* prepared. A simple enough task for a one-woman army like you.

**ILBERD:** Well, well. What brings you here, my friend?

**RAUBAHN:** She is here at my behest. Greetings, Raubahn. It has been a while.

**ILBERD:** Ilberd, you old scoundrel! When they told me you'd be visiting, I scarce believed my ears! But look at you! The honored captain of the Crystal bloody Braves! Who'd have imagined, eh?

**RAUBAHN:** Not many. But fewer still would have imagined your destiny lay in politics, old friend.

**ILBERD:** Aye...we've both come far, have we not? Lest you wonder, Ilberd and I go back a long way. We've been friends and rivals since we were lads. The last time we saw each other, Ala Mhigo had just fallen, so you can guess how many summers it's been. And in all that time, not a word from the fool!

**RAUBAHN:** Ah, well, my dealings tended toward the modest and mundane...unlike some I could mention. As I hear it, no sooner did you reach Thanalan than the Brass Blades clapped you in irons and dragged you off to die on the bloodsands. But being a stubborn sort, you won a thousand matches, and earned yourself a place in the people's hearts while you were about it. Then, with your mountain of prize money, you bought the Coliseum, and secured a seat on the Syndicate. Thal's balls, brother─rags-to-riches does not do it justice! You're a hero to the common man!

**ILBERD:** Bah, spare me. I am no hero. If anyone is worthy of that title, it's our friend here. Next to her, I'm little more than a glorified butcher. But you, Ilberd─you sell yourself short. By all accounts, you were an adventurer of some standing.

**RAUBAHN:** I like to think that I did my part for the greater good. But if you are no hero, then I am no adventurer─not in *this* company. Anyway... I have tidings.

**ILBERD:** So there has been progress. I've let it be known that this meeting is a reunion between old friends. None will give your visit a second thought. To convene elsewhere would only attract attention. Let us speak here, in plain view of all. ...So it is we who have been compromised. Teledji Adeledji's machinations have shaken Ul'dah to her foundations. In such uncertain times, a man's loyalty may be bought for a fistful of gil... But if this snake has truly been in our midst for as long as you say, we must needs consider a far graver possibility: conspiracy. Could it be that the Monetarists have been in league with the Empire from the first? Very well. I will have my most trusted men investigate the matter. Continue your inquiries in the meantime. It does me well to see you again, old friend. When next we meet, let it be over a flagon of ale.

**HAURCHEFANT:** I look forward to it. Let us reminisce of bygone days, and drink to the future of our homeland. Flame General... You wear the mantle well, old friend. I must work hard if I'm to keep up. Well, it would seem your services were not required after all. I daresay we have Raubahn's prudence to thank for that. Still, I was glad of your presence. My thanks, Scion.

**AYMERIC:** Have faith, my friend. You need only state your case with confidence and clarity.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Commander Leveilleur. It is both an honor and a pleasure to meet you. I am Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights.

**AYMERIC:** Alphinaud Leveilleur, at your service. Your reputation precedes you, Ser Aymeric. I think we will find that we have much in common.

**LUCIA:** Speaking of reputations, yours towers over us all. Does it not?

**AYMERIC:** (-Taciturn Temple Knight-)It does indeed, Lord Commander.

**ALPHINAUD:** I am not too proud to admit that I have followed your activities with an interest bordering on fascination. Full glad was I to learn that you would be joining us. Now then, shall we begin?

**AYMERIC:** We know full well that the Garleans will return in force ere long. What is more, we have yet to achieve a lasting victory over the primal menace. The beast tribes continue to summon their gods, and each incarnation is stronger than the last. Ishgard is not immune to these threats. I must reiterate that it would behoove your nation to rejoin the Eorzean Alliance.

**ALPHINAUD:** Once again, I must respectfully disagree.

**AYMERIC:** On what grounds?

**ALPHINAUD:** Despite their presence in Coerthas, the Ixal do not concern us. Their territorial claims pertain to Gridanian lands, and it is the people of Gridania whom they harry. Consequently, the Holy See judges this to be a Gridanian affair, and Ishgard does not intervene in the internal affairs of other nations. Even were that not the case, our forces are wholly committed to the Dravanian conflict. We have not the knights to spare. As for the Garleans, we are not ignorant of history. We have observed the rise and expansion of the Empire, and we agree that it is only a matter of time before they resume their campaign in Eorzea.

**AYMERIC:** Then surely it would be in our best interests to present a united front?

**ALPHINAUD:** Mayhap one day, but not yet. Gaius van Baelsar is dead, and the legion of conscripts he left behind lacks the will to fight. We think it highly unlikely that they will emerge from behind the walls of their castra for some time.

**AYMERIC:** Forgive me, but if Ishgard's position has not changed, why did you agree to this meeting?

**ALPHINAUD:** It was not only as a representative of Ishgard that I came here.

**AYMERIC:** Pardon?

**HAURCHEFANT:** It is not within my power to change Ishgardian policy, regardless of my personal feelings. There is, however, one area in which I may exert a measure of influence. Concerns have been raised over the supplies House Fortemps has offered to Revenant's Toll. These have led to calls for restrictions on the provision of aid to foreign powers. I can ensure that the shipments continue unabated.

**AYMERIC:** Ser Aymeric, we would be in your debt!

**ALPHINAUD:** No, you would not, for I require something in exchange. Of late there has been a flurry of Dravanian activity, the purpose of which was not immediately clear. However, our astrologians have since observed alarming changes in the heavens. The dragon star waxes unnaturally bright, and there are whispers that it portends the resurrection of Midgardsormr.

**AYMERIC:** The fallen guardian of Silvertear Falls? That's absurd.

**ALPHINAUD:** Full many times have I gazed upon the dragon's corpse, still wound around the *Agrius*, and wondered how different our world might be if it yet lived to plague the skies. I do not know, and I do not wish to know. Nor does any son of Ishgard. Yet the mere presence of Dravanian forces is not sufficient grounds to send knights to Mor Dhona, whatever our astrologians say. As I told you before, we have not the forces to spare.

**AYMERIC:** ...But we do. So, you will intervene on our behalf if we agree to watch over the Keeper of the Lake.

**ALPHINAUD:** Do you accept these terms?

**AYMERIC:** I do. I will see that you are kept abreast of any developments. I regret that we could not come to a similar agreement on other matters, but I understand that you are not at liberty to make such decisions. Nevertheless, I hope that what we have accomplished here today will serve to demonstrate to your countrymen that we can work together towards a common goal. Mayhap one day we shall look back on this moment as the first step towards a united Eorzea.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Mayhap we shall, Commander.

**CAVALRY02400:** What is the meaning of this!?

**HAURCHEFANT:** The caravan, my lord! It's been attacked! It was *Iceheart*, my lord!

**ICEHEART:** What!? By the Fury! All our precautions were for naught!?

**KANESENNA:** (-???-)The tales do not do you justice, Warrior of Light. (-???-)Yes, I know who you are. And you know who I am. (-Iceheart-)I was given the name Ysayle, but I earned the name Iceheart. (-Iceheart-)This endless cycle of hatred, of bloodshed, of sorrow─ You would see it continue, O noble Warrior of Light? (-Iceheart-)I would not. I *will not*. I will bring an end to this war between dragon and man─no matter the cost. (-Iceheart-)In time, you will come to understand that what we do, we do for the greater good. (-Iceheart-)For Eorzea. For Hydaelyn.

**MERLWYB:** Change has come to the Garlean Empire, and we must discuss the implications.

**KANESENNA:** The rumors are true then? The war of succession is ended?

**ALPHINAUD:** It is. A new emperor reigns in Garlemald.

**KANESENNA:** Who!?

**RAUBAHN:** The birth and all-too-rapid expansion of the Garlean Empire is commonly attributed to the strategic brilliance of Solus zos Galvus, yet he did not rule alone. Several members of the royal household also distinguished themselves during his reign. Nevertheless, it was the eldest son who stood to inherit the throne─until his most untimely passing.

**ALPHINAUD:** I thought us fortunate when I learned that the Emperor had died without naming a successor.

**RAUBAHN:** Would that the Garlean Empire had died with him.

**KANESENNA:** 'Twas the grandson and his uncle who had the strongest claims, was it not?

**MERLWYB:** Indeed. Yet claims count for little without the power to assert them. High Legatus Varis yae Galvus is a respected military leader─not so, his uncle.

**KANESENNA:** So, young Varis has torn the crown from his uncle's grasp, and taken his place at the head of the Empire.

**RAUBAHN:** Given the troubled nature of his succession, the new emperor will require time to seal his grip on power. Yet have no doubt but that he shall, for there are none left with strength enough to oppose him.

**MERLWYB:** Since the success of Operation Archon, the remnants of the XIVth Legion and the forces occupying Ala Mhigo have done naught but fortify their positions. But you can be sure they'll be ready to march on us again, if their emperor gives the word.

**KANESENNA:** *When*, not if. They say this Varis was so set upon Eorzean annexation that he spoke out against the Meteor project.

**ALPHINAUD:** Plainly, the new emperor's intentions are of great concern to us all. I propose that we set aside the Carteneau dispute for the present and discuss what measures the Alliance might take to prepare for a resumption of hostilities with Garlemald. Moreover, I move that we reexamine the question of how our former allies in Ishgard might be persuaded to retake their place at our side. Could Eorzea but stand as one, 'twould deal a grave blow to our enemy's ambitions.

**MOENBRYDA:** Well, I suppose we should be grateful that they have finally acknowledged the inevitability of imperial attack. Who knows, they may even do something about it. If only the leaders of Ishgard would follow their example, and stop hiding behind their gates, praying for the coming storm to pass them by. But that is a discussion for another time. At present, I am more concerned by the fact that the Alliance's mooted preparations will be made known to the Garleans many moons before their coming. So long as the Ivy eludes our grasp, no secret is safe.

**MINFILIA:** (-???-)Minfilia, am I right?

**MOENBRYDA:** None other. I bid you welcome to Revenant's Toll, and thank you for traveling so far on such short notice.

**MINFILIA:** (-???-)Hah! As if I could ever say no to Urianger!

**MOENBRYDA:** Moenbryda is an accomplished Sharlayan scholar and an authority on aetheryte technologies. She has played an invaluable role in our search for a means to capture Ascian souls.

**MINFILIA:** Charmed, I'm sure.

**YDA:** Everyone, if I could have your attention! We have with us an esteemed guest who is come from Sharlayan to assist us.

**MOENBRYDA:** Moen! Gods, it's been *ages*!

**YSHTOLA:** Oh, longer, sister!

**YDA:** A joyous reunion indeed.

**PAPALYMO:** Well, of course it is! Moen and I are like twin sisters!

**MINFILIA:** ...Save in appearance and aptitude.

**MOENBRYDA:** Everyone, please! I bid Moenbryda join us here that she might share with us her extensive knowledge of aetherytes. Also, as many of you are already aware, she has been overseeing our research into white auracite─a sample of which she has been good enough to bring with her.

**URIANGER:** Well, I had to come, didn't I? You'd have to be bloody *daft* to turn your nose up at a chance like this. Where better to conduct my final tests than a land so steeped in aether you can taste it!?

**MOENBRYDA:** 'Tis plain the passage of the years hath done little to dampen thy youthful spirits... ...And nothing at all to reform thy youthful manner.

**URIANGER:** Urianger! Where in the hells've you been hiding?

**MOENBRYDA:** Un...unhand me.

**THANCRED:** I come all this way, and *that's* what you have to say to me!? I much preferred when you were pleading with me to drop everything and hurry to your side. What was it you said? “None save thee can satisfy this need─”

**URIANGER:** Go on...

**MOENBRYDA:** Th-Thine artless attempts to misrepresent mine all-too-innocent motives do thee little credit! Mine intent, as well thou knowest, was but to impress upon thee the gravity of the circumstance. Lest thou doubt, a deiform entity shall shortly be summoned, save if thou, and no other, grantest my compeers thine aid.

**MINFILIA:** You still haven't found it, then? Your missing aetheryte?

**MOENBRYDA:** We have not, no. We know that Iceheart teleported to an aetheryte not far from the first, yet even after careful analysis, we could not locate the second beacon. We now suspect that the heretics destroyed the second aetheryte to impede our pursuit. Our allies continue to scour Snowcloak for Iceheart's sanctuary, but we have no guarantee that they will find it. Yet it must be found, for even now Iceheart prepares to call upon Saint Shiva.

**MINFILIA:** I'm sorry but...if the aetheryte's been destroyed, then that's that. Although... You're absolutely sure she used the first aetheryte, are you? She didn't just use teleportation magicks?

**MOENBRYDA:** One of our own bore witness to her escape. I can say with absolute certainty that Iceheart used the aetheryte.

**MINFILIA:** In that case, there might be a way─so long as the aetherial current is still flowing.

**MOENBRYDA:** Truly? How?

**THANCRED:** We use the current to recreate the beacon. As you know, aetherytes are a bit like lighthouses. We use them to reconstitute our physical forms when crossing the aetherial sea. Without them, we'd lose all sense of direction and our essence would dissipate. However, we don't rely solely on these beacons. There are currents of aether which flow between them─currents which help guide us to our destination. Now, these currents will gradually dwindle away to nothing if an aetheryte is destroyed. But if even a sluggish flow remains, we could theoretically use it to direct a surge of concentrated aether towards the void left by the beacon and thereby fill it up again.

**PAPALYMO:** Like opening the floodgates to fill a dry riverbed. Though, correct me if I'm wrong, but would we not need a veritable reservoir of aether?

**YSHTOLA:** In concert, we *might* manage to channel a sufficient volume, yet that is not my chief concern. To direct the flow of so great a volume of aether with the requisite precision would be a nigh-impossible task in itself.

**MOENBRYDA:** I barely succeeded in facilitating travel to an unattuned beacon. That which you describe sounds considerably more difficult.

**MINFILIA:** And dangerous! Every person who has attempted to teleport in this fashion has died in the process. They, however, did not have white auracite at their disposal! I can use it to channel all the aether you can give me into the aetheryte. However, white auracite cannot retain aether for an extended period of time, so we would need to infuse it immediately beforehand. Just so you know, I'd confidently give this plan better than even odds of success. And if the worst comes to the worst, your people won't suffer.

**MOENBRYDA:** Though it risk the lives of our best and brightest, we have not the time to seek other options. If the aetherial current still flows, we shall carry out Moenbryda's plan.

**ICEHEART:** That's the spirit! Let's roll the dice!

**SHIVA:** You should never have come here, Warrior of Light. I labor only to forge a lasting peace. A peace you would deny us out of ignorance and blind faith. No matter. If it is our fate to be at odds, then it is *mine* to strike you down. We whom gods and men have forsaken shall be the instruments of our own deliverance! Partake of my flesh─fill this vessel with your light! Walk amongst your brothers and sisters once more! O Saint Shiva, still the hatred within our hearts and bless us with eternal grace!

**ICEHEART:** Hmph...

**NABRIALES:** (-Iceheart-)Fool... Blind, bloody fool. (-Iceheart-)You of all people should understand the suffering war begets─that no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the violence. (-Iceheart-)*Mine* is the righteous cause! (-Iceheart-)You fight in a war you do not understand─a pawn of liars and schemers. (-Iceheart-)And they are no less ignorant than you! Following the creed of their fathers without question, never thinking to ask why. (-Iceheart-)Trapped in a delusion of their own creation and blind to the truth. (-Iceheart-)Warrior of Light, redemption is not beyond us. (-Iceheart-)We who walk before may lead those who walk after. (-Iceheart-)Seek the Keeper of the Lake. See with eyes unclouded. (-Iceheart-)Do...do not squander Mother's gift. (-Iceheart-)Hear... Feel... Think...

**AYMERIC:** (-???-)And so the vessel withdraws. A predictable outcome. (-???-)Nevertheless, Lahabrea will be pleased. (-???-)How unfortunate.

**ALPHINAUD:** On behalf of the Holy See of Ishgard, allow me to express my deepest thanks. Never before have we been required to contend with a primal. Indeed, there were fears in some quarters that our knights might not be equal to the task. From what we have now learned of these beings, I can say with certainty that we would have lost a great many men had the Scions not intervened.

**AYMERIC:** Then the argument for preemptive action should be self-evident. Perchance now you will reconsider my proposal that Ishgard move against Natalan?

**HAURCHEFANT:** Ere we first met, a similar proposal was tabled─but the Holy See decreed that we were to observe, and that military action should be taken only in self-defense. All things considered, it was not an unreasonable decision. Since the Calamity, two vigils have fallen to the Horde, while Garuda has never shown any inclination to storm the Gates of Judgement. ...Which is why this unprecedented crisis and its resolution may prompt a change in policy. You who have faced these primals know well the threat they pose. Ishgard did not─not until now. And there is naught like a brush with death to change a man's outlook.

**AYMERIC:** At the very least, this should silence any lingering objections to our arrangement with Revenant's Toll. The Holy See may even feel moved to grant us its formal endorsement.

**ALPHINAUD:** So far as it is possible, the Scions shall be compensated for their service.

**AYMERIC:** We should be grateful for any aid you can provide.

**ALPHINAUD:** As a gesture of good faith, I shall withdraw my previous request. Your people are doubtless needed elsewhere.

**AYMERIC:** That will not be necessary. We too have a vested interest in watching Dravania's movements.

**ALPHINAUD:** I see. Once more, I must thank you.

**AYMERIC:** Ser Aymeric, if I may... Do you truly believe that Midgardsormr could return?

**ALPHINAUD:** The heavens are a window unto truth, but those who interpret their movements are not infallible. I requested your involvement as a precautionary measure.

**LUCIA:** But of course... You sought an excuse to *compensate* us from the first, mindful of what would happen if Revenant's Toll were taken by your enemies. Ishgard is not wont to aid its neighbors, but that does not preclude it from manipulating them to serve its own interests.

**AYMERIC:** (-Taciturn Temple Knight-)Choose your next words carefully.

**ALPHINAUD:** Do you know what sort of man becomes lord commander of the Temple Knights? One who comes from good stock. I did not, yet here I am. Now why do you suppose that is? Because I swiftly learned to tell the difference between words, deeds, and beliefs. ...You are correct, Master Leveilleur. Ishgard desires to see Revenant's Toll flourish, as it would present a troublesome obstacle to our enemies from the south.

**AYMERIC:** We are so glad to be of use to you.

**ALPHINAUD:** As we are to you. Ours is a mutually beneficial arrangement, lest we forget. One born of necessity. The dragons grow more restless by the day, and the heretics harry us nigh without cease. We have contended with such troubles for centuries, but there are limits to even our endurance. Yet as a pauper is loath to part with his meager possessions, the leaders of Ishgard are not wont to render up their trust to outsiders. But with perseverance on *our* part, they may yet be made to see the light. Nevertheless, one must take care when walking the road less traveled.

**AYMERIC:** Wise words, Ser Aymeric. I shall make a point to remember them. I must apologize for my earlier outburst. I hope it will not sour our good relations.

**LUCIA:** Not at all. You but spoke from the heart. I trust you understand that, at times, my duties may prevent me from meeting with you. On such occasions, my second-in-command will speak for me.

**AYMERIC:** (-Lucia-)Lucia, at your service. (-Lucia-)Pray excuse our reticence. We are but wary of speaking too freely, lest our sentiments be made known to our enemies. (-Lucia-)Know that the lord commander and I are of one mind. For the sake of Ishgard─and of Eorzea at large─I pray our peoples can put aside their differences. (-Lucia-)Those who dwell in the past risk losing sight of their future.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Should aught befall one of our shipments, pray inform Lucia immediately. You may also relay to her any words you might have for me alone. Not being of Ishgardian birth, she owes no allegiance to any noble house, making her as near to incorruptible as one can find in my homeland. Suffice it to say, I trust her completely, and so may you. Which reminds me─ Lord Haurchefant, if you would be so kind.

**AYMERIC:** Certainly.

**ALPHINAUD:** In times such as these, trust is ever in short supply. Mayhap this will go some way to rectify the problem. The results of our investigation into the heretics' recent attacks, as well as our interrogation of the merchant you detained.

**AYMERIC:** Ser Aymeric... I cannot thank you enough.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Think nothing of it. Ishgard may be many things, but it is no friend to Garlemald.

**MINFILIA:** Did I not tell you to have faith, my friend?

**YSHTOLA:** Words cannot well express how glad I am to see you returned to us hale and whole. Needless to say, I am most eager to hear your account of that which occurred in Coerthas─assuming you are ready to speak of it? Excellent. I shall summon the others at once. Iceheart used *her own body* as a vessel for a primal's soul?

**PAPALYMO:** Master Louisoix's writings make no mention of such a possibility. Can we be certain this entity was a primal?

**THANCRED:** As certain as we can be that Good King Moggle Mog XII was a primal, I should think. Both were ostensibly summoned.

**YDA:** Let's not quibble over definitions. Of more concern is the implication that Iceheart retained her will even after she was possessed. We are talking about a mortal wielding the power of a primal!

**URIANGER:** It can't possibly be that easy, can it? There must be some sort of sacrifice required. Or maybe she's just special?

**MOENBRYDA:** What qualities this woman possesseth, I know not, but full sure am I that she was groomed for this role. Few are privy to the secrets of summoning, and but a single party standeth to profit from their dissemination.

**YSHTOLA:** Well, I wouldn't presume to comment on how the lass came to know about summoning, but I *will* say that what she summoned was a primal. The readings were the same, or near as damn it. Strange as it all sounds, it's really no different from what you've faced before.

**PAPALYMO:** Then mayhap it is time that we reexamined our previous encounters.

**YDA:** Pack your things, Yda. We're going back to Gridania.

**MINFILIA:** Yes sir!

**URIANGER:** About Iceheart's final words to you... "Hear... Feel... Think...“ Hydaelyn speaks to *her* as well. If Iceheart is blessed with the power of the Echo, she will doubtless have used it to further her goals. ...Or could it be that it was a revelation granted her by the Echo which first set her on this path? She did say that the Ishgardians were blind to the truth. Do you think she has knowledge of the origins of the Ishgardian-Dravanian war? It would do much to explain her unwavering conviction.

**MINFILIA:** Did not the Lady Iceheart implore thee to seek the Keeper of the Lake? And did she not imply that in so doing thou wouldst come to see with eyes unclouded?

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** Midgardsormr was a king amongst kings who reigned for centuries on end... But he is dead, and his wisdom lost to the ages─unless the Ishgardians' fears are well founded... It would seem we have yet another reason to stand watch over the Keeper of the Lake. For a mercy, we are well positioned to do so. Iceheart, Shiva, Ascians, and Midgardsormr. I shudder to think how they are all connected...

**MINFILIA:** I have heard. Truly bothersome business. No, I do not foresee a problem on that front. The main concern is Raubahn─there is no telling what the brute might do. Have the Blades watch him and the Flames day and night. You may leave the sultana to me. I shall personally attend Her Grace. <sigh> Sever one of the East Aldenard trade routes. That ought to keep Lolorito occupied for a while. Nanamo Ul Namo... For my sake, pray be a good little sultana to the last.

**MOENBRYDA:** Welcome back, my friend. I have already received word from Alphinaud. To think that Flame Marshal Roaille was the Garlean agent... I know not what to say. Together with Raubahn, Eline lent us much-needed aid at the time of our order's founding. She was particularly passionate about the need to tackle the primal threat. When we discussed the subject, her eyes fairly shone with determination. Whatever else she may have been, I choose to believe that it was her true self with whom I spoke then... But now is not the time to dwell on such matters. I have an important announcement to make regarding our effort to defeat the Ascians. We shall begin as soon as everyone is assembled. My thanks for coming, friends. Moenbryda, the floor is yours.

**URIANGER:** By now, I'm sure you're all familiar with white auracite, the miraculous material that'll allow us to capture Ascian souls. Back at Snowcloak, we verified its ability to absorb vast amounts of aether. Alas, it leaves something to be desired in the area of stability. The stone can only store aether for a short while before expelling its contents.

**MOENBRYDA:** In addition to auracite's inherent limitations, we must needs be wary of our enemy's strength. Our foe draweth upon an infinite wellspring of power. Even should we succeed in entrapping him, the stone will not long contain his wrath.

**URIANGER:** Meaning that if we want to kill the swine, we'll have to be quick about it.

**MOENBRYDA:** 'Tis our belief that an Ascian soul may be permanently undone if smitten by a sufficiently concentrated burst of pure aether.

**URIANGER:** The only trouble is, we can't say for sure how concentrated the burst needs to be... Without knowing how much aether an Ascian soul is composed of, we're basically guessing.

**MINFILIA:** Our sole clue lieth in thy struggle with Lahabrea.

**URIANGER:** During that encounter, Hydaelyn bid you forge what She called “a blade of Light,” a weapon which took the form of a luminous stream of energy. Based on your description, we believe the “blade” with which you vanquished your foe was composed of aether. Admittedly, your victory proved ephemeral, as Lahabrea was able to use a Crystal of Darkness to flee into the space that lies between our world and the void. The fact remains, however, that Hydaelyn placed the means to destroy the Ascians in your hands. Be that as it may, it would be unwise to assume that She will do the same when next we encounter such a foe.

**PAPALYMO:** Quite so, my lady. We must needs find the means to forge our own blade of aether─one to equal that which Hydaelyn did benevolently bestow upon Her champion.

**YDA:** That is all well and good, but it seems to me that producing such a blade will require a prodigious quantity of aether. Whence will it come, pray tell?

**MOENBRYDA:** Ummm... Oh! What if we had *two* pieces of white auracite? One to trap the Ascian, and the other to store the aether for the blade!

**THANCRED:** Nice try, but it's as I said: the stone won't hold aether for any length of time. We'd still need to collect the stuff there and then, sorry to say.

**YSHTOLA:** And therein lies the rub: finding a way to create the blade whenever and wherever we choose.

**MOENBRYDA:** 'Twould seem more research is in order.

**URIANGER:** I'm going to linger awhile─perform a few more tests on the auracite. And I could do with some help. Urianger, why don't you lend me a hand?

**MOENBRYDA:** M-Mine apologies, but I am required at the Waking Sands. Lady Minfilia hath given me sole charge of the premises. 'Twould be unseemly to leave them unattended.

**MINFILIA:** "Sole charge,“ you say? So...you're basically *alone* there, then? Well, that settles it! I'll just have to come to you!

**URIANGER:** While you were afield, word arrived from the Sharlayan motherland. You will recall that a survey party was dispatched to investigate the incident at the Isle of Val. What they discovered was troubling to say the least. According to the report, the isle has been erased from existence. 'Twas as if a hole had been torn in the very fabric of reality.

**MOENBRYDA:** Aye...yet the mystery endeth not with the isle's disappearance. It hath come to light that a number of scholars in various other locales were reported missing at a similar juncture.

**MINFILIA:** What's more, they all had something in common with the head of the Students of Baldesion. Every last one of them was researching a phenomenon called dimensional compression─or the “Rejoining,” as the ancient texts call it. I'll be damned if *that's* a coincidence.

**RAUBAHN:** All indications suggest Ascian involvement, but I sense that a force greater still is at work─the entity the dark beings call “the one true god”... We must pray that my dear friend Krile regains consciousness soon. If she bore witness to the Isle of Val's final moments, she may be able to shed some light on this mystery...

**ILBERD:** Following the Calamity, the forces of the XIVth Imperial Legion entrenched themselves in strategic locations across Eorzea. So swiftly did they accomplish this, it was suspected that they had received help. To think that it came from Roaille... My right hand.

**ALPHINAUD:** There is more. We have reason to believe that Roaille didn't deal exclusively with the XIVth. She also answered to a higher authority in Garlemald. But this higher authority could not have been the Emperor. By consenting to the Meteor project, Solus zos Galvus showed himself to be more concerned about preventing the spread of primal influence than claiming Eorzea for the Empire. He would happily have seen the lot reduced to ash. We believe a number of high-ranking figures within the royal household were against the decision, but that they knew better than to oppose the Emperor openly. Of course, this didn't prevent them from making clandestine provisions, in which Roaille played a part.

**RAUBAHN:** Alas, these provisions did not prevent Dalamud from falling, and the ensuing chaos changed the face of the realm forever. Yet Eorzea survived. To all intents and purposes, the Meteor project had failed, and the Empire was left to rue its lack of a decisive means to eliminate the primals. Until, that is, it stumbled upon the Ultima Weapon.

**ALPHINAUD:** Even before the accursed thing was dug up, it seemed to me the XIVth had the might to overwhelm our weakened armies. Yet they chose to hide behind their walls. Why?

**ILBERD:** The Black Wolf was wary of making the denizens of Eorzea desperate, lest more primals emerge to bleed the land. The discovery of the Ultima Weapon, however, emboldened him to resume his war of conquest in earnest.

**RAUBAHN:** But there was one in Garlemald who believed that van Baelsar's actions were premature─one who stood higher in the imperial army's chain of command. He ordered the legatus to halt his advance, only to find that the Black Wolf had slipped its leash, and that the XIVth now acted alone. In a bid to bring van Baelsar to heel, he used the agent he had planted in Ul'dah prior to the Calamity to undermine the legion's efforts.

**ILBERD:** A man who outranks van Baelsar, yet opposed the late emperor's decision to annihilate Eorzea... This could only be the former high legatus of the Garlean Army, now known as Emperor Varis zos Galvus. So he was Roaille's true master...

**RAUBAHN:** But one of several, in actual fact. We've learned that even as Roaille served the Empire's interests, she sold imperial secrets to a certain faction in Eorzea. In so doing, she helped to maintain the status quo, thus prolonging the conflict. Considering who stands to profit from war, it isn't hard to imagine who her other masters were.

**ILBERD:** Seven hells... You mean to say that she was a double agent?

**ALPHINAUD:** Triple, if you consider her services to van Baelsar and the new emperor as separate.

**RAUBAHN:** As neatly as these pieces seem to fit, one aspect of the puzzle remains unclear to me. By whose will was the marshal feeding intelligence to the heretics? And try as I might, I fail to see how aiding their cause would profit either her imperial or Monetarist masters. Could it be that another hand is at work here? If so, Roaille must be made to reveal whose it is.

**ILBERD:** Not only have I lost a trusted friend; now I must interrogate her as a stranger.

**RAUBAHN:** Not a pleasant task, I grant you, but a necessary one. Unless we weed out the Ivy, root, stalk, and stem, it will simply grow back.

**ALPHINAUD:** I know that full well. Those closest to Roaille have already been detained, and I will question them alongside her.

**RAUBAHN:** General. Pray keep in mind that there may be unwitting abettors among them.

**ALPHINAUD:** All will be treated fairly─on that you have my word. Those who are innocent have no cause to fear.

**RAUBAHN:** You have ever been a friend of truth, General. I hope the unpleasant task of weeding out falsehood will not detain you too long. Though it be for the sake of Eorzea, doubting one's comrades is poison to the soul. ...And with that, I take my leave.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** All these years, I've been made to dance to their tune... How could you, Roaille? How could you side with *them*...? ...Those *cankers* who take from this land and give naught in return─who use their power to disempower, and grow fat while the people starve! I know you can hear me, Monetarist scum! Your crimes will not go unpunished! One day, I will purge this land of your sickness! Before the eyes of the Twelve, I swear it! Raaaaaargh!

**LADYINWAITING2:** I shall have no further need of you this day.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** (-Lady-In-Waiting-)Your Grace.

**KANESENNA:** I fear that not even mine own chambers shall remain private for long.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Has the situation grown so grim?

**MERLWYB:** Ever since he proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill, Teledji Adeledji has risen to greater prominence upon the backs of impoverished refugees. The Monetarists were ever united in their pursuit of profit, but the man's actions have torn a rift in their ranks. They snap at each other as rabid dogs. Yet now is not the time to be bickering among ourselves.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** If this bickering is a threat to law and order, might you not have grounds to dissolve the Syndicate?

**KANESENNA:** Would that the solution were so simple, Admiral. Alas, my moving to dissolve the Syndicate is certain to spark outrage among the influential merchant class, whom the cabal represents. This would serve to exacerbate the current unrest, and peace would slip still further away. Be they rich or poor, natives or refugees, all who reside in Ul'dah have a right to pursue happiness. It is the duty of a ruler to protect this right. If I am to perform my duty, I must needs tread warily. It would not do to make enemies heedlessly. Were Lord Lolorito here, he would doubtless say that I have my head in the clouds.

**MERLWYB:** A ruler is required to take a wide view. Try as we might to cater to all needs, some will inevitably be overlooked. As such, there shall ever be citizens who feel aggrieved. It cannot be helped. But as you have informed us, the Monetarists take no view but their own. They hunger for power while the masses starve. In the absence of a common cause, it seems beyond any one individual to make Ul'dah whole.

**KANESENNA:** And the presence of a Garlean agent within the Immortal Flames only makes matters worse. Even accounting for Ul'dah's historic reliance upon mercenaries, such a grievous breach of security is unprecedented. I fear this business will provide the Monetarists with a rod to beat Raubahn.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Eorzea can ill afford for the Immortal Flames to be dampened now. Ere long, the Garleans will turn their ravenous gaze toward our lands once more. If we are to resist their might, our nations must stand together. Yet for this to happen, our nations must be whole. Can naught be done to improve the situation in Ul'dah?

**MERLWYB:** The true wealth of Ul'dah lies in the health, happiness, and hopes of her citizens. Alas, the citizens shall never know these things so long as their lives are ruled by the ambitions of the few. The Monetarists claim to represent the best interests of the people, but in sooth they desire only to manipulate them for their own selfish ends. For the government to serve the people, it must be formed of the people. For Ul'dah to move forward, it is not only the Syndicate that must be dissolved.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Nay... You jest...

**KANESENNA:** My friends─it was for no other reason than to make known to you mine intent that I requested your presence here. When I make my declaration to the people, chaos shall inevitably ensue. As the last monarch in the line of Ul, I make unto you this request. Help Raubahn to preserve order, and protect the people. Forsake them, and you forsake yourselves, for a strong Eorzea will ever have need of a strong Ul'dah.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace... Are you certain of this?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALPHINAUD:** Gods, he is almost whole again!

**ALISAIE:** His size is staggering... I can scarce imagine how Grandfather stood against such a monstrosity.

**LOUISOIX:** This cannot be allowed to proceed any further. Let us disable the coil and move on. Grandfather! No, that man is dead. I will not dishonor my beloved grandsire's memory by calling you such. You are but his twisted shade─the thrall of a mad primal.

**ALPHINAUD:** You were foolish to disregard my warning, child. Are you so convinced of your own righteousness?

**LOUISOIX:** 'Tis the rightness of our path that led us to return. Eorzea will never be safe whilst Bahamut remains to threaten all we hold dear. What of the hero who gave his life in defense of the realm? Do you truly dispute the justice of our cause?

**ALISAIE:** My poor, ignorant grandchildren─your world is shaped by naught but recent conflict. Listen, and I will speak to you of “justice.” 'Twas in the twilight of the Third Astral Era... The southern land of Meracydia suffered invasion at the hands of the Allagan Empire. With no atrocity too depraved for their purpose, the forces of Allag were unstoppable in their advance. Desperate for salvation, the dragons prayed to one of the first brood─to their ancestor Bahamut. Infused by the power of their fervent supplications, Bahamut arose from the abyss of death and took wing as the Meracydians' newborn god. Yet this great miracle would only serve to further the maniacal designs of the dragons' imperial conquerors. The cruel fetters which bind my lord stand testament to the Allagans' boundless greed and hubris. I once summoned the Twelve in an attempt to forestall the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era. What then did the dragons of Meracydia do that I did not? Wherefore are they accursed and I exalted? 'Tis man's overweening belief in his own primacy that blinds him to the commonness of his condition...and the truth of his own tyranny. As long as man is suffered to remain, the dragons shall never be at peace. Only when the plague of people has been expunged shall the children of Lord Bahamut be free. Then shall the world know true justice.

**LOUISOIX:** Stop it! Grandfather would never say such things! His belief that people were worth saving never faltered! He had faith in their strength...that they could stand together and push back against the darkness seeking to shape them.

**ALPHINAUD:** A false hope. 'Tis folly to place one's faith in so flawed a race. "Stand together“? Hmph. They would first need to agree on which direction to face. If history teaches us anything, it is that man cannot find common ground between his own two feet. Even you, twins whose veins run with the same blood, struggle to fathom each other's reasoning. You hide your differing agendas behind the convenient banner of Eorzea's salvation. Given your obvious self-interest, can you truly claim no kinship with the Allagans? And though I hoped they might bring you closer, 'twould seem that the twin grimoires I bestowed upon you were a wasted gesture...

**LOUISOIX:** There may well be truth in your judgment of Alisaie and me... But such a one-sided tirade bemoaning the evils of man rings false coming from the lips of Archon Louisoix. Tell me─do you champion the cause of dragons because Bahamut compels you as his thrall? Or is it because you yourself have transcended the limits of man's existence?

**ALISAIE:** Ah, so the possibility did not escape your notice? What I prayed for, and what I have become...these are the *keys* that unlock the truth behind Eorzea's rebirth. If you would have them, then you must needs take them by force. Come, rend this divine form asunder and claim your answers!

**ALPHINAUD:** But...I thought... He has become a primal!?

**ALISAIE:** 'Tis difficult I know, but you must accept it: that entity is no phantom or impostor─it is our beloved grandsire!

**LOUISOIX:** Please─for his sake and for ours─you must defeat our grandfather! Grandfather is truly gone this time. But better it end this way than the alternative...

**ALISAIE:** I am yet here, Alisaie. My dear, sweet granddaughter...

**LOUISOIX:** Grandfather...?

**ALISAIE:** I must thank you, Warrior of Light. Without your valor, I might never have broken free of Bahamut's control. These last few moments are mine to live as the man I once was.

**ALPHINAUD:** This is all that I wanted. Yet now that it is happening, I find myself struggling to believe it... Is it really you?

**LOUISOIX:** Grandfather, pray forgive me my insolence. It was not my intent to demean you.

**ALISAIE:** Forgive you? I am proud of you, child. You were wise enough to deduce the manner of creature I had become. Alphinaud. Alisaie. If any here should beg forgiveness, it is I.

**LOUISOIX:** Grandfather, I must ask... Will you not tell us what befell during the Calamity?

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes. Yes, of course. You have come far to hear the truth... Let us then begin the tale at the Battle of Carteneau, where clashed the forces of the Garlean Empire and the Eorzean Alliance. 'Twas there in the sky above the surging armies that the elder primal Bahamut broke free of the red moon, Dalamud. In an effort to contain this avatar of destruction, I called upon the Twelve to aid me in the creation of a prison of aether... But Bahamut would not be caged by such feeble bars─too vast was his might; too fierce his rage. You know of what happened next. I used the last of my strength to send you and your companions outside of time, and then prepared to meet my end. Little choice remained to me. I used the last of my strength to entrust our hope unto the future, and prepared to meet my end. As you have no doubt surmised, I did not perish. When the cage built from the essences of the Twelve was destroyed, the sky was filled with a colossal cloud of aether... This drifting energy responded to the prayers of those fighting below─and to my own desperate wish that the dying realm be saved─by infusing me with the power of a primal. I became the immortal Phoenix, ancient symbol of rebirth. Rising into the sky, I struck Bahamut with all my newfound strength. The blow shattered his earthly form, and a shower of aether rained down upon the land. Thus began the rejuvenation of Eorzea. Believing the deed done, I relinquished my hold on that staggering energy, desirous that it should be returned to the realm without delay. But I had not reckoned on Bahamut's tenacious will. Even as he teetered upon the cusp of oblivion, the dragon reached out to claim me. Alas, within my fast fading form, enough remained of the Phoenix's energy to offer Bahamut a hold, and he dragged me along in his wake.

**ALISAIE:** And thus began your existence as the elder primal's thrall...

**ALPHINAUD:** I cannot help but wonder at his will to survive... Though he was all but obliterated, Bahamut found a way to seize the power you surrendered. That would explain why part of his physical form survived to be entombed underground.

**LOUISOIX:** 'Twould also explain why Eorzea was so terribly warped. Even as the land sought to restore itself, the returning flow of aether was cut off.

**ALISAIE:** Very good. When his grip on existence was once again secured, Bahamut did not cease his feast until he had consumed every last mote of aether that yet floated in the air.

**LOUISOIX:** And *still* he was not fully restored...

**ALPHINAUD:** You must remember that by this time, much of the freed aether had already returned to the land. That which remained was not sufficient to reconstruct so massive a form in its entirety. But there did not need to be─not for a being sustained by the marvels of Allagan technology. As long as some piece of Bahamut persists, the coils will seek it out and continue their regenerative task. The fragments of Dalamud appear motionless from the surface, but deep beneath the ground they had been searching...tunneling through rock and soil towards their escaped prisoner. And, as you have observed for yourselves, they found his heart. Warrior of Light, heed me. You must put a stop to Bahamut's regeneration. Whether it be for man or for dragonkind, the question of justice is irrelevant. The elder primal will leave naught but a smoldering wasteland for both his children and ours. I beg you to defend Eorzea─as you always have, and as I always knew you would. I beg you to defend Eorzea, and guide its people to the future they yet struggle to find. This portal will take you to the final internment hulk. 'Tis time for the tale of Bahamut and his part in the Calamity to come to an end! Alphinaud, Alisaie. Pray come closer. Your hopes and dreams must no longer be an extension of mine. You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm─your own meaning in this sea of chaos. Will you do that for me?

**LOUISOIX:** Of course, Grandfather. I have already made it my mission to see this newborn Eorzea survive and flourish.

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie. While I was yet in thrall to Bahamut, you spoke of my faith in man's strength. Know that your words reached me, imprisoned though my soul still was. So forceful was your conviction, I wonder if that belief has not become your own. Perhaps, after all your anger and sorrow was spent, you found something greater within you. See this fight to its culmination. 'Tis also *your* strength in which I have faith.

**LOUISOIX:** Thank you...for everything... Pray take your rest, Grandfather... You deserve it.

**ALISAIE:** There are records of an art that allowed one to summon the power of a primal from the essence of its demise. And though I am no true primal, all that I have left, I give to you. Alphinaud. Alisaie. My darling grandchildren. May Light's blessings ever keep and protect you.

**ALPHINAUD:** Come, Warrior of Light. Our task remains undone! 'Twas a long and arduous road, but at last we reach its end. Farewell, Bahamut. I banish you back to the aether! He is not yet whole! I did not think him capable... Ah!

**ALISAIE:** Ugh! Ugh... Alisaie! ALISAIE!

**LOUISOIX:** I had thought it finally over... We'll not survive another blast! No... Is this how I honor my promise to Grandfather?

**ALISAIE:** You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm─your own meaning in this sea of chaos. Will you do that for me?

**ALPHINAUD:** I will, Grandfather. In fact, I believe I already have. That reason has been with me all along, guiding me─Eorzea's blade of Light, shearing through the endless shrouds of darkness... I have been shown the miraculous feats of which we are all capable. Of which *I* am capable. Bahamut! You have wreaked enough havoc! I will not let your wrathful fires consume all that we know and love! Ugh!

**ALPHINAUDANDALISAIE:** How long I have waited to hear you say that! You have found your resolve at last! Let me join my strength to yours. In this place, in this moment, our purpose has become one!

**ALISAIE:** (-Alphinaud and Alisaie-)For the future of Eorzea!

**ALPHINAUD:** This last task is yours, Warrior of Light! You must destroy Bahamut's crystal core! You did it! But one task remains... With this last coil disabled, there shall be naught left to bind Bahamut to this world. His beloved children will finally know peace... 'Tis done. He is truly gone. You knew, didn't you? You knew what Grandfather had become.

**ALISAIE:** I...was not certain. But from all I had gleaned, it seemed a distinct possibility. The scene people describe of the Battle of Carteneau was one of unimaginable devastation. And 'tis through the combined prayers of the desperate─and an abundant source of aether─that primals are born. I merely put two and two together.

**ALPHINAUD:** And you consider that a sufficient explanation? Well, however you stumbled across your theory, 'twas this revelation that made you wary of my attachment to Grandfather. You feared that in my obsession, I would fall under his primal sway. Is that why you decided to join us? To pull me back should I show signs of wavering?

**ALISAIE:** Pray forgive me, Sister. I wished only to protect you. Yet I see now that I needn't have doubted the strength of your conviction. May I ask you a question? What do you now intend to do with the truth you have uncovered?

**ALPHINAUD:** Which particular truth was that, Brother? The fact that desperate prayer gave rise to the primal Phoenix? That this new god was responsible for setting Eorzea on the path to rebirth? Should such a tale become common knowledge, people would soon offer up their prayers in earnest─they would beseech Phoenix to complete the healing that was begun.

**ALISAIE:** Yet as you and I know all too well, the very act of calling forth this savior would do more harm to the land than good. We cannot encourage such worship for this very reason. Were Grandfather forced to return as an aether-draining primal, 'twould undo all that he had worked to protect. Your abiding love for him was the key that unlocked the truth of the Calamity. But keys may also serve to seal doors that were best left unopened. Let your love now guide your actions, and lock away deep inside the fate of both Grandfather and Bahamut.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**LUCIA:** We have a guest from Ishgard who wishes to speak with you. I believe the two of you have met?

**MOENBRYDA:** We have. I had hoped to speak with Commander Leveilleur as well, but I cannot afford to wait any longer. The lord commander sent me hither to request your aid in a matter of grave import.

**MINFILIA:** You see now why I had Tataru summon you.

**LUCIA:** Now that we are all assembled, perhaps you would be good enough to elaborate on the nature of the matter which brought you to us.

**URIANGER:** The Observatorium's astrologians have sounded the alarum. Last night, the dragon star burned with an intensity not seen in fifteen summers. Not since the Dravanians engaged the Empire in the Battle of Silvertear Skies.

**LUCIA:** “The northern sky doth burn full bright upon the wyrm lord's call. The red behemoth beckoneth, and flame consumeth all.”

**URIANGER:** The old Coerthan rhyme, aye. The brightening of the dragon star is said to accompany the roar of a great wyrm. The astrologians believe that it was Midgardsormr himself who cried out on this occasion.

**MINFILIA:** After an absence of centuries, the king of kings did return to lead his kind against the might of Garlemald... ...Only to fall in his duel with the *Agrius*, proud flagship of the Garlean fleet. Devoid of life, his corpse remaineth entwined about the magitek monstrosity even unto this day.

**MOENBRYDA:** Urianger has the right of it. Whatever this alteration in the dragon star portends, the great wyrm has shown no sign of life. Tataru, have the Domans reported aught out of the ordinary?

**LUCIA:** Correct me if I'm wrong, but if Midgardsormr had roared, wouldn't we have heard it here in Revenant's Toll?

**MINFILIA:** “Roar” is but a figure of speech. Dravanians can communicate in ways beyond our ken. It is for this very reason that we are forced to look for signs in the heavens. We cannot say with any confidence that a great wyrm roared at all, much less that it was Midgardsormr. Only by directly examining the Keeper of the Lake can we be certain. However, it will take too long to gain the Holy See's approval to dispatch the Temple Knights. Therefore, Ser Aymeric would entrust this task to you. Do you accept? We knew you would not disappoint us. Now, if you would excuse me, I must return and assist the lord commander. We have precious little time to prepare.

**LUCIA:** To prepare for what, pray tell?

**MIDGARDSORMR:** When a great wyrm roars, his brethren cannot choose but answer. We prepare for battle.

**LUCIA:** Who treadeth now upon my bones and waketh me from slumber sweet? Thou hast forgotten the face of thy lord. Remember, mortal, and fear me. By Her gifts hast thou earned a moment's reprieve. Speak, mortal, and I shall listen. Guided by a *star*...? Heh heh heh. My people have heard the song. Ishgard shall burn. Sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds. We do not forget. We do not forgive. Seven children did I sire. One now singeth of retribution. I rise to join in the chorus. Thou art powerless to silence us, mortal. Yet thou shalt not live to labor in vain. Thy reprieve is at an end. Hmph. Trickery is thy shield. This frail, ignoble creature is not gifted, but chosen... Hearken to me, Hydaelyn! I remember...and I *consent*. Fear not, mortal... I shall not harm thee... Heh heh heh. Mayhap thou thinkest me an oathbreaker? Thou art mistaken. If thou comest to harm, it shall be by another's hand, not mine. I did but strip thee of thy mistress's feeble blessing. Thou didst profit much by Her grace, but no more. The covenant binds me to thee. I shall watch...listen...and *wait*. Fight and struggle, if it be thy will. Man hath ever coveted that which lieth beyond his grasp. I drink of Her body, and thence doth mine own find new life. When it hath grown whole, the loyal and penitent shall rejoice. The Dragonsong heraldeth a beginning...and an end.

**ALPHINAUD:** My friend! I can scarce believe it! You confronted the wyrm lord and lived to tell the tale! I give thanks to Halone for your preservation. It is our sole cause for gladness. Your encounter with the Keeper of the Lake served to confirm our fears. A great wyrm has roared, and it makes little difference if it was one of the two in Eorzea or any other... The Dravanians are coming.

**LUCIA:** I am told that Ishgard has magical defenses against Dravanian attack, though I am not privy to their exact nature. Will they be enough to repel a massive force?

**ALPHINAUD:** Ishgard has weathered countless assaults over centuries. This will be no different. And now that you have confirmed the threat, none can ignore the lord commander's calls for the wards to be strengthened. I dare not presume to speak for him, but I expect the lord commander would sing your praises. I must away, but we shall meet again soon.

**MOENBRYDA:** Countless assaults weathered...and this will be no different? Why am I not convinced?

**MINFILIA:** Now that everything's calmed down a bit─relatively speaking, I mean─I thought it might be a good time to share our progress on the weapon. I believe we're on the verge of a breakthrough.

**MOENBRYDA:** Well, don't keep us all in suspense.

**THANCRED:** Just in case anyone's forgotten, let's start by reviewing what we already know. So! An Ascian is an immortal because its soul doesn't return to the aetherial realm when its host is defeated. Instead, it flees to the place that lies between our world and the void. Therefore, the first step to *permanently* defeating an Ascian is preventing its soul from making this journey. And if you recall, when we last gathered here, I had verified that white auracite has adequate capacity to entrap the beings, albeit only briefly.

**URIANGER:** Which left the small matter of their extermination.

**MOENBRYDA:** Aye. To unmake an Ascian soul, one must needs smite it with a concentrated burst, or “blade,” of purest aether. However, we wanted for both the data and the means to forge such a weapon.

**YDA:** Short of experimenting on an actual Ascian, you see, there's no way to gauge how much aether its soul is made of. As such, we don't know what aetheric density our blade needs to have in order for it to work.

**PAPALYMO:** So we'll just have to make the densest blade we can, and hope for the best! Though that would require a *lot* of aether... Hang on a minute! Why didn't we think of this before!? White auracite can hold an absolute *heap* of aether, can't it!?

**YDA:** Please tell me you're joking. Gods' sakes, Yda! I feel as though I'm reliving the same scene over and over with you! How many times do you need to be told that white auracite cannot store aether for long periods? Being intangible matter, aether is given to dispersion; only in its crystallized form is it a stable source of energy. I will test you later on this, so see to it you do not forget.

**THANCRED:** Ah...r-right, yes... It's all coming back to me...

**YSHTOLA:** So our hopes rest on good old crystals again, do they? While they are certainly reliable, they leave something to be desired in the area of portability.

**THANCRED:** Indeed. I am reminded of the quantity of corrupted crystals required to thwart Leviathan, and the extraordinary lengths to which the Lominsans went to transport them. What if it should prove that a similar quantity was needed to destroy an Ascian soul─or still *more*...?

**MOENBRYDA:** I do not envy the poor sod who has to lug all of that around on the off chance that an Ascian appears.

**YSHTOLA:** That's the very problem we set out to solve, and I reckon we've found the answer. If it isn't practical to lug around the aether we need, we'll just have to draw upon another source. And the only viable source is the land.

**MOENBRYDA:** If you mean to tap the great river of aether, know that it will entail considerable risk. Meddling with the currents may well induce a surge like to the one which despoiled Mor Dhona.

**THANCRED:** Give me a bit more credit, will you? Why would we need to tap the river when there're veritable *reservoirs* jutting out all over the land? Aye, I speak of corrupted crystals. It might be that their aspect is out of balance, but a crystal's a crystal─it contains aether, and we can help ourselves to it.

**MOENBRYDA:** While corrupted crystals are indeed abundant, there is no guarantee that they will be in close proximity at a crucial moment.

**MINFILIA:** Ah, but what if we don't need them to be? What if we could tap their power from *afar*? A malm away, say? If we could do that, we'd have ready access to aether aplenty in almost every corner of Eorzea. I've yet to put my theories to the proof, but I've got a good feeling about this. If no one has any objections, I'd like to see where this avenue leads.

**MOENBRYDA:** If you think it worth your while, you have my blessing. But tell us, what *are* your theories? I for one am most eager to understand the process, however vaguely.

**ALPHINAUD:** I thought you might say that. But no one wants to listen to boring old theories all day, do they? I know I don't. So, with your permission, I'd like to try something a bit more hands-on. I've already built an aetheric siphon especially for this purpose, and I've been meaning to try it out. Thing is, the profusion of corrupted crystals in Mor Dhona makes it something of a high-risk testing ground. If anything goes awry with the siphon, it would be better if it didn't happen within spitting distance of quite so much aether. Ideally, I need an isolated specimen. Does anyone know where I can find one?

**MINFILIA:** May I suggest northern Thanalan? There you will find corrupted crystals of middling size, standing a reasonable distance apart. Ideal for your needs, I should have thought. Oh, and if you do elect to visit the place, I should be much obliged if you would assist me in another matter while you are in the area.

**ALPHINAUD:** Has something happened?

**MOENBRYDA:** Movement has been observed at Castrum Meridianum. During Operation Archon, the Alliance dealt the stronghold a heavy blow. Its facilities were extensively damaged, and its garrison reduced to a fraction of its former strength. Not long after our forces withdrew, however, their ranks were replenished by reinforcements from Castrum Centri. They now seek to rebuild, and to this end they have their sights set upon the Ceruleum Processing Plant. Having lost the Empire's support, the XIVth Legion lacks the resources to sustain itself. To them, this is a bid for survival, and they will doubtless fight like desperate men. Though I have dispatched the Crystal Braves, I fear their strength alone may not suffice to stay the imperial assault. I would request the Scions' aid in the defensive effort.

**URIANGER:** If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to inveigle us into fighting your battle with the promise of shiny crystals! Well then, consider me inveigled! I won't lie, the crystals you speak of sound perfect─so the Garleans have to go! Besides, we can't afford to beat about the bush. There's no telling when the Ascians will next appear.

**MINFILIA:** Thine eagerness to hurl thyself into the jaws of danger cometh as little surprise. Exercise due caution, I prithee.

**URIANGER:** Though you have become a Crystal Brave, you are yet a Scion, Alphinaud. We could hardly refuse you. Pray join the Crystal Braves and lend them your support. Thancred and Papalymo shall accompany you. Yda and Y'shtola─in the meantime I would have you assist Moenbryda. Scout out the crystal clusters, that the testing may commence as soon as the Garlean threat has been eliminated.

**MINFILIA:** If it please you, I shall continue mine own experiments on white auracite.

**MOENBRYDA:** Thank you, Urianger. Everyone, pray see to your preparations and depart as soon as you are able. Go well, and be safe.

**NABRIALES:** Hold on. I won't be a second. The beast seemed peckish, so I gave it a taste of my axe. I know, I know... As Urianger never tires of reminding me, “An axe ill becometh the hand of a scholar.” What can I say? I like axes. To hear my mother tell it, I came into this world holding one. And it's not as if it stopped me picking up a quill, is it? I often think of the man who introduced me to the joys of learning... He's one of the reasons I decided to come to Eorzea. ...Him and my excruciatingly stiff childhood friend. Considering how unalike we are, it's a wonder we ever got on. The world's a strange old place, isn't it? Aye, that ought to do it. So far, so good. At these concentrations, it shouldn't matter too much if something goes awry. Just enough aether to make it interesting. Did you see that? The way the crystal glowed? The siphon works, I'm happy to say. With a few refinements, it should satisfy our appetite for aether. Which just leaves the small matter of forging our blade. I'm not sure how to go about it just yet, but I swear to find a way. I'll put a blade in your hands if it's the last thing I do.

**MOENBRYDA:** (-???-)She senses me. A useful talent.

**NABRIALES:** An Ascian!? Are they onto us!?

**MOENBRYDA:** By your brand, I see you are an Archon of Sharlayan. Keeper of knowledge. Seeker of truth. Meddler.

**NABRIALES:** I don't know what the hells you're saying, but I don't much like your tone.

**MOENBRYDA:** Hahaha. Your instincts serve you well. But come, be not unsettled on my account. That lovely brow was not made for frowns. Ah, but I waste my breath. Let me direct my words to one who understands them. We meet at last, Warrior of Light. I am Nabriales... ...And you have long been a thorn in my side. I suffered the overweening presence of Lahabrea that men might host the power of gods, only for you to undo my hard work.

**NABRIALES:** Yaaarrrgh! Oh, bugger... Urgh!

**MOENBRYDA:** Do settle down. You must concede that I acted in self-defense. But what's this? I do not sense the blessing of Light... Oh dear! Could it be that frail Hydaelyn has forgotten Her champion!? This I did *not* foresee! Shorn of Light as you are, you are no longer a threat. And better yet, the seal is broken. Now is the time to claim the staff! With it in my grasp, I shall rise above them all and take my place at Lord Zodiark's right hand!

**MINFILIA:** What did that bastard want with us? Nabriales, he calls himself? With charm like that, I'll bet he has maidens falling at his feet. Unconscious. But this staff─you say just talking about it had the bastard grinning like a brat on his nameday? Must be quite a staff. Oh, gods... He means Tupsimati, Master Louisoix's staff! Minfilia's in danger! We have to get back to the Rising Stones!

**NABRIALES:** You two!

**MINFILIA:** So you were able to divine my intent. What now, Warrior of Light? Ah, but that name is no longer fitting. You have become decidedly *dull*, and quite incapable of barring my entry.

**NABRIALES:** What do you mean!?

**MINFILIA:** You truly do not know? Then I suppose it is only right that I *enlighten* you. The blessing of Light kept you and your fellow meddlers safe. It was that which prevented my kind from entering your domain. My kind, I say, though it had no power over the likes of Elidibus and Lahabrea. Being of this world, they could come and go as they please, while I could only look on... But I need look no longer. Now that the seal is gone, I mean to act. Unlike the others, I am not given to waiting. I shall take that staff and bring about the next Rejoining.

**MOENBRYDA:** ...Rejoining? Then it was *your* doing! The Isle of Val, the scholars─all of it!

**MINFILIA:** You will not harm her! Urrrgh!

**NABRIALES:** Moenbryda!

**MINFILIA:** Why must you insist on forcing my hand? Did you learn nothing from our last meeting? Ah, but I forget─my words fall upon deaf ears.

**NABRIALES:** The staff is but a broken relic─a memorial to the departed. What possible use could you have for it?

**MINFILIA:** What use!? You mean to say that all this time, you kept the key, never knowing what it was you possessed? The staff Tupsimati─or rather, the stone tablet it bears─is host to a great power. Together with the horn, it can be used to draw vast quantities of aether from its bearer's surroundings. How else do you think Louisoix was able to invoke the power of the Twelve without making them an offering of crystals? Summoning requires not only prayer, but a profusion of aether. Even a child knows that.

**NABRIALES:** If I did not know before, you may be certain I do now. But above all, I know that we cannot allow this staff to fall into your hands. I will die before I let you take it.

**MOENBRYDA:** Insufferable woman. I would happily end your miserable life here and now... Alas, Elidibus would never let me hear the end of it. Very well. If you will not part with the staff, I will take you too.

**NABRIALES:** After them! Quickly...before the rift closes!

**MOENBRYDA:** It appears I have underestimated you... You are a formidable foe, even without the blessing of Light... And now I am forced to reveal this unseemly form. Hmph.

**NABRIALES:** You're safe... Thank the Twelve...

**MINFILIA:** You may have bested me this day...but what of the next? What of all the days to come!? Remember: Light no longer holds sway here. I may return whensoever I wish. Again and again and again. Eventually, you will falter and the staff will be mine. Until next time, Scions.

**NABRIALES:** There will be no next time! This is the end!

**MINFILIA:** What!? What trickery is this!? No! Nooo! You cannot! Nooooooooo!

**MOENBRYDA:** Use Tupsimati to gather aether! Quickly, before he breaks free! Concentrate! Call to mind the time you struck down Lahabrea with the blade of Light! Why won't it work? Is it because we lack the blessing of Light?

**NABRIALES:** Damn it... So much aether...and it still isn't enough...

**MINFILIA:** Fools! No mortal prison can contain me! I shall make you pay for your insolence!

**MOENBRYDA:** Please, Mother Hydaelyn! Hearken to our plea! Lend us Your divine Light! Why can You not hear us? Do our words no longer reach You?

**MINFILIA:** If only we had...a bit more aether...

**MOENBRYDA:** Moenbryda! What are you doing!?

**MINFILIA:** Master Louisoix... I understand now...the choice you made... In death...there is life... Farewell, Urianger...you daft old coot...

**NABRIALES:** Moenbryda, no! You mustn't─!

**MINFILIA:** What!? Nooo! It...it cannot end! I am eternal! I am immortaaaaaal!

**YDA:** Moenbryda... She's...she's gone... You did it, my friend. The Ascian is dead. This device is a legacy of Moenbryda's toils and sacrifice. I shall hold on to it for safekeeping.

**MINFILIA:** Minfilia! Are you all right?

**PAPALYMO:** I am.

**THANCRED:** We were surveying northern Thanalan when we received the distress call. We returned as swiftly as we were able.

**YSHTOLA:** It seems you have everything in hand, however.

**THANCRED:** What happened here? Where is Moenbryda?

**YSHTOLA:** She gave her life to temper the blade of Light? I...I have no words.

**YDA:** Rather than await the inevitable, she took her fate into her own hands.

**MINFILIA:** Does...does Urianger know...?

**URIANGER:** My friend. There is something I must tell you.

**MINFILIA:** I heard all, my lady. The moon sinketh, taking her leave of the heavens. Yet her passing heraldeth the coming of a new day.
...Moenbryda hath fulfilled her destiny, hath she not? Long ago, far across the seas in the Sharlayan motherland, Moenbryda and I did study under the sage tutelage of Master Louisoix. Full oft did he impress upon us that knowledge existeth to serve the greater good. This sentiment, however, was contrary to the nation's policy of neutrality, which censured intercedence in the affairs of foreign lands. In spite of vehement opposition, he founded the Circle of Knowing and journeyed hither to the heart of Eorzea. Through his noble sacrifice was the realm spared its doom. Yet this great soul, whom all should rightly have honored, was branded a pariah in his own land. His peers did accuse him of forsaking his duty as a man of learning, and of meddling in the course of history. When he left Sharlayan behind, Master Louisoix gave no word to signal his intent to Moenbryda. Close as they were, as master and disciple, she was deeply wounded by the sudden exclusion from his confidence. Above all, however, she was confused. Try as she might, she could ill comprehend her master's motive. The slanders that were heaped upon him after his passing served only to inflame the turmoil within her. For years upon end, she knew not what to believe, torn as she was 'twixt the man whom she revered, and the man who forsook her and his duty both.

**URIANGER:** The Louisoix I knew would never forsake his duty, much less one of his own.

**MINFILIA:** This I know full well, my lady. 'Twas not for want of love that Master Louisoix hid his intent. He but desired that Moenbryda discover her own path, free of the shadow of his influence. Long did I contemplate revealing the truth to her, and long did I hold my peace. After all, was it not Master Louisoix's wish that she come to the truth unaided? I told myself it was, and resolved to let her suffer. Knowingly did I deny my friend the comfort she craved. And now she hath gone to her rest with doubt still in her heart. Speakest thou in earnest? Did Moenbryda truly come to understand Master Louisoix's will before the end? The realization hath set her free. She may now find the peace which hath for so long eluded her. Oh, Moenbryda... My dearest... How I shall miss thee...

**URIANGER:** Moenbryda gave her life that we might possess the means to defeat the Ascians. Her sacrifice must not be in vain. Let us continue her work on the blade of aether and see it to completion.

**MINFILIA:** My lady. I would mourn Moenbryda in mine own way. I beg your permission to return to the Waking Sands.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Of course, my friend. Take all the time you require. We shall be here should you have need of us. Forgive me, Moenbryda. Had I been quicker, or wiser... But I was not, and you paid the price. But you would not suffer us to wallow in our sorrow, would you? You would tell us to...pick ourselves up and get on with it. And so we shall. We shall defend this realm and her people to the last.

**YDA:** Life for death. A fair exchange. Other bargains will be struck.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** I'll never forget you, Moen. None of us will.

**YDA:** The song riseth to a crescendo.

**ALPHINAUD:** Is that what I think it is...?

**MINFILIA:** Hello!? Can you hear me!? We have received grave tidings from Ishgard. Pray return to the Rising Stones at once.

**ICEHEART:** Twelve forfend, is the hour already upon us!? Come. Our enemies do not rest, and neither will we.

**MINFILIA:** (-Iceheart-)The sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds. Only then will the cycle be broken... (-Iceheart-)Brothers and sisters of the heavens! We raise our voices and join you in the chorus! (-Iceheart-)The sinners' feeble magicks are undone! Come! Claim your retribution! (-Iceheart-)Ahahahahahah!

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud, it is good to see you. Tell me, what have you learned?

**MINFILIA:** Pray summon the others. Everyone must hear my report.

**ALPHINAUD:** So this was all but a taste of what's to come...

**PAPALYMO:** Indeed. The main host advances upon Ishgard as we speak.

**YSHTOLA:** Whose vaunted defenses have been nullified.

**YDA:** Shorn of its wards, the city will bear the full force of Nidhogg's fury.

**THANCRED:** All those people...

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud is right. The Dravanians cannot be allowed to prevail. If Ishgard falls, all of Eorzea will suffer the consequences.

**MINFILIA:** Then you agree that we have no choice but to intervene. For the good of the realm, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Crystal Braves must join the defense of Ishgard.

**ALPHINAUD:** Let there be no ambiguity about what has been proposed. We would be directly intervening in the war. But if all here believe the cause to be just, then to war we shall go. The path we now embark upon is perilous, but I pray you will walk with us to the end. For those we have lost. For those we can yet save.

**MERLWYB:** Then it is settled. I shall inform the council of our intentions, and request that they contribute their own forces to the defense of Ishgard.

**ALPHINAUD:** We are well aware of Ishgard's dilemma, and we agree with your assessment.

**RAUBAHN:** Then I trust there are no objections to the Crystal Braves' intervention?

**KANESENNA:** Ul'dah has none.

**MERLWYB:** Gridania does not object.

**ALPHINAUD:** The Crystal Braves are yours to command, Alphinaud. Do what you will. We shall pray for your success.

**MERLWYB:** It was my hope that you would offer more substantial aid than prayer. I know it is within your means.

**KANESENNA:** Do not presume that you have knowledge of our every concern. The Garleans and the beast tribes are but two of many. We are not in a position to contribute greatly to the defense of Ishgard─not when our own homes are still under siege.

**ALPHINAUD:** We dare not leave our interests in Carteneau undefended as well. Teledji Adeledji and his ilk would seize control of the territories in our absence.

**RAUBAHN:** The enemy is at their gates, and you would cower behind yours!?

**MERLWYB:** No one is cowering, boy. We will offer what support we can.

**KANESENNA:** Aye. *Support*. A handful of men and no more.

**RAUBAHN:** Would that we could commit more than a token force to this cause. Yet there *are* others to whom you might turn. The free companies ever want for work.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, yes, the free companies... They're not like to turn you down.

**MERLWYB:** I beg your pardon!? You would entrust the survival of Ishgard to *sellswords*!? Crises like these are the very reason why this alliance was formed! It is our duty to aid our fellow man!

**ALPHINAUD:** My *duty* is to *my* country and *my* people. If you expect us to place the welfare of a foreign power above our own, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Lest you doubt, Limsa comes first, then the Alliance, and finally─circumstances permitting─Ishgard and the rest. If you cannot understand so simple a concept, then you have no place at this table.

**RAUBAHN:** Forgive me, Admiral. I was...careless in my choice of words.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I suggest you assemble a party of elite adventurers, assuming you haven't already. Your fellows served us well during Operation Archon. I daresay they will do so again. If I may, Your Grace, I wish to propose a redistribution of forces. If we entrust the security of Ul'dah to the Brass Blades for a time, we can dispatch a larger force to Ishgard. Your Grace?

**RAUBAHN:** Yes, yes of course. Do what you will.

**LADYINWAITING2:** Is Her Grace not feeling well?

**RAUBAHN:** To the best of my knowledge, Her Grace is in perfect health.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I see. Carry on.

**LADYINWAITING2:** O Sultantree, hallowed spirit of my line... Through my weakness, the glorious House of Ul has all but disappeared beneath the sands. For want of the strength to raise it up again, it were better that it fall. Forgive me, but I know not what else to do... You needn't trouble yourself so.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace is most kind, but it is no trouble to me, rather an honor. If Your Grace is ready, I shall summon the Warrior of Light.

**KANESENNA:** I am.

**AYMERIC:** I take it you have grown accustomed to your responsibilities?

**MINFILIA:** The day-to-day duties are not so demanding. The social obligations, on the other hand...

**ALPHINAUD:**  Everyone looks to be in high spirits.

**MINFILIA:** With good cause.

**ALPHINAUD:** A common victory may serve to unite even the most unlikely of allies. You've brought us one step closer to a united Eorzea.

**MINFILIA:** Your modesty knows no bounds, Antecedent. Were it not for your efforts, Ser Aymeric would never have become such a steadfast ally. When he convinces his countrymen to rejoin the Alliance, we shall all reap the benefits─military *and* economic. I tell you, we are on the cusp of a new era of unity and prosperity. Territorial disputes are all that divide us now. But I have faith that we will find an amicable solution in time. And failing that, I'll have my trusty Warrior of Light box the ears of all concerned. Speaking of whom...?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** She will be joining us shortly. A matter at the Quicksand required her attention, but it did not sound serious.

**LADYINWAITING2:** Enter.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace. Your guest has arrived.

**MERLWYB:** Pray come in, and take your ease.

**KANESENNA:** 'Tis well that the Steps of Faith held against the Horde.

**AYMERIC:** And what of the city proper?

**RAUBAHN:** We sustained some few losses, but the heart of our nation yet beats with vigor. I am not certain I could say the same had we not received your most generous aid.

**ALPHINAUD:** An attack on Ishgard is an attack on the realm. We stand together or fall divided.

**AYMERIC:** Such noble words...after the fact.

**ALPHINAUD:** I had hoped to speak in the presence of Her Grace, but it seems she has been delayed... That being the case, now would seem as good a time as any... Honored friends! Pray allow me to convey Ishgard's warmest gratitude for your part in the defense of our lands. 'Tis upon the success of this very alliance that my recommendation to throw open the Gates of Judgement shall be founded. With the blessing of the archbishop, it is my hope that Ishgard will soon be reunited with her long-estranged sister nations─and that Eorzea shall once more be as one!

**MINFILIA:** Very well.

**ALPHINAUD:** Is aught amiss?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Nothing to worry about. I shall return anon. You wished a word, Yuyuhase?

**LADYINWAITING2:** You may go.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** You must be curious as to the reason for this private audience. The matter I would discuss, however, will soon make apparent the need for discretion. I intend to abdicate the throne and dissolve the monarchy. You have seen for yourself the storm of turmoil that howls through our streets. The government fails in its responsibilities, and my subjects suffer the consequences of our incompetence. But I will see them suffer no longer. The victory feast shall provide the stage on which I declare the dissolution of the sultanate. 'Tis mine intent that the ruling class of our golden city should take its place beside the common man in a fair and equitable republic. No more shall this nation bow to the whims of a privileged few. Yet that which I propose will entail the tearing up of this city's very foundations. And even Raubahn with all his strength and influence will be hard-pressed to keep his footing on such treacherous ground. Thus would I ask you to lend him a steadying hand. You who have endured the wrath of innumerable foes are the one hero in whom I can place my trust. Will you do this thing for me? I am truly grateful. More grateful than I can well express. How much we have both changed since that day we met beneath the Sultantree... And the days ahead promise to change us further still. I hope that we will recognize ourselves when all of this is over... Much of my dread for the coming days has been quieted...

**BRASSBLADE02400:** Your Grace!? Her Grace... The sultana is dead. Poison in her wine...? You! You did this! Spare us your denials! I see no other suspects, and the room has but the one entrance! I hereby accuse you of regicide! Men─arrest this viper!

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Brass Blade-)Sir! You're coming with us!

**CRYSTALBRAVE02400:** <gasp>

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Crystal Brave-)Sir. Barring a few exceptions, we have detained all those with allegiance to the Scions. The Rising Stones is also under our control.

**YUYUHASE:** And what do you hope to achieve with this mutiny?

**RAUBAHN:** Why, that which we have striven for all along, Commander: the salvation of Eorzea.

**AYMERIC:** What is the meaning of this?

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** Knights from the homeland? This cannot bode well...

**AYMERIC:** Lord Commander. We have received an urgent message from the Holy See. I am grieved to report that your serpentine foes have resumed their assault. Needless to say, your presence is urgently required. These knights have come to bear you swiftly home to Ishgard.

**LUCIA:** ...A surprise attack?

**AYMERIC:** We've had no such word from our men. And the timing is most fortuitous to catch us away from the city...

**TEMPLEKNIGHT02400:** Most fortuitous indeed...

**AYMERIC:** Lord Commander, we must away!

**THANCRED:** You have been a most gracious host. I hope that I might one day return the favor. Come, Lucia.

**BRASSBLADE02400:** Whatever is going on in there...? Ah, the ever-dutiful Brass Blades. I must apologize, but my dance card is rather full. Another time, perhaps?

**THANCRED:** Thancred of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. You stand accused of committing acts of espionage in service to the Garlean Empire.

**BRASSBLADE02400:** Espionage? What in the seven hells are you talking about? Ah. If you're referring to that business with the Ultima Weapon, then you must understand─I-I wasn't myself...

**THANCRED:** Under interrogation, an imperial prisoner revealed your involvement in numerous dealings with the enemy. We've also been investigating reports that you are a practitioner of forbidden arts. You'd best come along with us.

**RAUBAHN:** You invite me to your party and now you want me to leave? I do so detest receiving mixed signals. Come, then. I believe I've lost my appetite for this farce of a celebration!

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** You go too far, Lord Adeledji! By what right do you march armed soldiers into a royal banquet and eject state visitors without Her Grace's consent!? You treat the Brass Blades as your personal army, and show contempt for the throne with your every act. Leave us. Now.

**RAUBAHN:** Is that an order, General? Mayhap you have mistaken me for one of your Flames? You will find I am not so slavishly obedient. And you lecture *me* on personal armies! As for your *outrageous* claim that I have shown contempt for the throne, let all here observe that it was not *I* who feasted while an assassin removed its occupant! I expect this is your idea of defending the nation, is it? This and diluting our forces through these distractions in Carteneau and Coerthas! I do begin to see how the ranks of the Immortal Flames came to be riddled with Garlean sympathizers! You are plainly unfit for command!

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** Wait... Wait, gods damn you! Your words make no sense. What assassin?

**MINFILIA:** You mean to say you don't know!? We caught the vaunted champion of the Scions in Her Grace's private chambers not moments after the deed was done!

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** No─ No, this cannot be!

**ILBERD:** Save your breath. You will need it to plead your case. You and your entire order are to be tried for this atrocity. Bring in the prisoner!

**MINFILIA:** This woman stands accused of poisoning Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo. And as suspected accessories to the crime, all members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn will be detained for questioning!

**ILBERD:** This is madness!

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** What a pity... Who'd have thought your tale would end like this?

**YSHTOLA:** Should you demand further proof, a vial with traces of the substance used to poison Her Grace was found upon the assassin's person.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** How very convenient.

**MINFILIA:** You would speak of convenience? Who persuaded Her Grace to host this celebration? A diversion which presented you and your confederates ample opportunity to commit the crime, and a crowd within which to fade from view! A more “convenient” occasion I could scarcely imagine!

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** How dare you! After all we have done for Ul'dah!

**PAPALYMO:** Hold your tongue, witch! I'll not be ensorcelled! I know all about the dark gift that you and your disciples wield! Oh, yes...I've observed how you worked upon the minds of the Alliance leaders, bending them to your will! And what of your *cordial* relationship with Ser Aymeric? For years, Ishgard abjured all contact with the outside world, and now the lord commander of the Temple Knights treats you with the familiarity of a childhood friend! I'll tell you what I think─I think this desperate defense of Ishgard was but a ruse to deceive us into dividing our forces. Your next move will be to charm your Coerthan allies into invading our lands!

**YDA:** Now that is truly ridiculous.

**RAUBAHN:** How do you even think of this stuff!?

**ILBERD:** She... She cannot be dead... Stand aside, Ilberd! I want to see the sultana!

**RAUBAHN:** Spare yourself the pain, brother. I saw her with my own eyes. For a mercy, the poison took her swiftly─her handmaiden can attest to that.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** This cannot be... Nanamo... Nanamo... NOOOOOO!!!

**RAUBAHN:** Plainly, the Royalists can no longer be relied upon to keep our nation safe. And so it falls to the Monetarists of the Syndicate to govern Ul'dah. But should you wish to help us, General, we would be more than happy to entrust the task of planning Her Grace's funeral to you. It seems only right that you should bury your precious sultana, and we will be glad to be rid of that burden.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** I'll bet you will. You more than any man.

**RAUBAHN:** ...Whatever do you mean?

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** I mean you had her killed, you black-hearted bastard!

**RAUBAHN:** What rot! ...Though I did have sufficient motive, 'tis true. That young lady caused me no end of grief. She always was a most unwilling puppet. I daresay Her Grace was grateful that someone thought to cut her strings.

**TELEDJIADELEDJI:** You would mock her? THEN MOCK HER FROM HELL!

**LOLORITO:** Wha─

**RAUBAHN:** Have you lost your mind, General!? It is forbidden to draw steel in the royal chambers, much less slaughter our fellow Syndicate members! <gasp> ...You're one of them! You've been in league with the Scions all along!

**MERLWYB:** YOU! You're next, you scheming bastard! AAARRRGH!!!

**KANESENNA:** Seven hells!

**GUARD02500:** Raubahn!

**MERLWYB:** (-Maelstrom Soldier-)Admiral, we must leave!

**LOLORITO:** How unlike you, old friend. I did not expect to take your arm so easily.

**RAUBAHN:** Take the Scions into custody! They have conspired to commit regicide! And arrest this traitor as well!

**ILBERD:** Ilberd! I hope you choke on their coin!

**RAUBAHN:** 'Tis better than the dirt I've supped on these long years. We can't all abandon Ala Mhigo and become great war heroes as you have. You are not the man you once were, Raubahn. Since that girl strapped the yoke around your neck, you've become docile. She took the mad bull and cut off his balls. And a bull that cannot rut is fit for naught but slaughter. Shall I tell you who really killed your precious sultana? ...It was me.

**ILBERD:** You! You die!

**RAUBAHN:** Hmph.

**THANCRED:** I never doubted you. Not for a moment. But there is more to this than I yet understand. Flee this place. Clear your names. Find out who is behind this plot! It is the only way! Now go! Yaaaaaargh!

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, there you are!

**THANCRED:** Thancred! Where have you been?

**PAPALYMO:** Avoiding the fumbling advances of some very persistent admirers. When I realized the celebrations had turned sour, it seemed prudent to slip away and take stock of the situation. 'Twould appear that much of the city is already under tight guard. It occurs to me that expanding the Brass Blades' authority may not have been such a wonderful idea after all...

**YSHTOLA:** The success of this plan was contingent upon those thugs having the run of the place. Just how long has this scheme been in motion?

**YDA:** The careful preparations, the maneuvering of forces... I am inclined to agree with the General's insistence that a deeper plot exists here.

**PAPALYMO:** So...would I be right in thinking we now have an excuse to pummel as many Brass Blades as we like?

**MINFILIA:** Unless you plan on pummeling them *all*, I'm not sure that will greatly aid our cause.

**PAPALYMO:** The sultana's assassination was but one part of the scheme. We too were its targets. And though we did not share poor Nanamo's fate, we are yet hobbled by the charges laid at our door. Where now might we seek refuge?

**THANCRED:** Where indeed. We may safely assume that our foe has thought to have the Rising Stones watched.

**YDA:** Forgive me for stating the obvious, but our choice of destination will matter little if we cannot secure an escape route out of Ul'dah. Happily, I believe I can provide one. Papashan once told me about the passages hidden in the walls of the palace. If I recall correctly, the fireplace in Nanamo's chambers conceals the entrance to a tunnel. It should lead outside the city, and allow us to avoid any messy confrontations.

**PAPALYMO:** The rest of you go on ahead. I'll handle this lot!

**YDA:** By yourself!? <sigh> ...I suppose I shall just have to join you.

**MINFILIA:** Crystal Braves, too, huh? Now *this* should be interesting!

**PAPALYMO:** Yda! Papalymo!

**THANCRED:** We will hold our pursuers here. Hurry, now! Find this tunnel of Thancred's!

**YDA:** Minfilia! We cannot linger!

**PAPALYMO:** Ow! Now look what you've done!

**YDA:** Yda, are you all right!? There are just too many of them...

**PAPALYMO:** I'm fine! I could do this all day! How about you?

**YDA:** ...Nearing the end of my tether.

**PAPALYMO:** This is so *stupid*! We're the Scions of the Seventh Dawn! The ones who stand between this realm and the evil that's trying to destroy it!

**YDA:** And if you think we'll leave the stewardship of Eorzea to the likes of your masters, then you're sorely mistaken!

**PAPALYMO:** Sorry I dragged you into this, Papalymo...

**YDA:** Hah, 'tis hardly the first time. And I'll be damned if it will be the last. Let them have it, Yda!

**MINFILIA:** I was hoping you'd say that!

**YSHTOLA:** I never knew such a watercourse existed beneath Ul'dah.

**CRYSTALBRAVE02400:** The architecture is of the Sil'dihn style, if I am not mistaken. The ancients plainly foresaw the need for a ready means of escape.

**THANCRED:** (-???-)This way!

**YSHTOLA:** Well, that didn't take long. It seems these tunnels were not as secret as I had hoped.

**MINFILIA:** You two go on ahead. Thancred and I will deal with this.

**YSHTOLA:** Wh-What do you mean to do!?

**THANCRED:** Only that which is required to ensure that the dawn's light survive to brighten the morrow.

**MINFILIA:** Fear not, Antecedent. You haven't seen the last of these fair features.

**YSHTOLA:** My friends...

**THANCRED:** Leave us!

**YSHTOLA:** What is the plan, milady? Shall I take the dozen on the left, and you the dozen on the right? The odds are not exactly stacked in our favor...

**THANCRED:** Numbers will count for little when I bring the tunnel down upon their heads. Though I cannot say I relish the thought of being entombed with you for all eternity.

**YSHTOLA:** You wound me! I will have you know that many a maid would *kill* for the chance to spend forever at my side! Now, may I have the last dance? Ugh! Well, this is going splendidly... Now would be a good time, milady!

**THANCRED:** 'Tis done! Forgive me, Mhitra...

**MINFILIA:** Farewell, Minfilia...

**ALPHINAUD:** Hydaelyn... She speaks to me. No! I must remain behind...but you cannot stay with me. Please, you must go on! You are the Warrior of Light! You are *hope*─for the Scions, and for all the realm! As long as your flame continues to burn, the light of the dawn may ever be relit! You must escape, and save Eorzea from those who would plunge it into darkness! 'Tis the only way...

**PIPPIN:** I am glad to see you safe, my friend! What of the others? Damn that man! Teledji played me for a fool! I thought the Crystal Braves mine till the very moment I felt the blade at my back...

**BREMONDT:** (-???-)There will be ample time for soul-searching later. For now, we must put some malms between us and Ul'dah.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, if it ain't the hero of the Scions! You look to me like a woman in need of a nice, relaxin' carriage ride! Well, would you look who it is! Need a ride? I doubt it'll be half as excitin' as the last trip we took─not if I have anythin' to say about it, anyway! Let's not dawdle, eh? All aboard! I was stockin' up on supplies over in Vesper Bay, you see, when your sister come up an' begged a favor. Said her brother was havin' some trouble down in Ul'dah, an' likely needed a helpin' hand gettin' away. Thinkin' them ruins would make a fine hidin' place, I decided to try there first...an' lo an' behold, there you were. Aye, an' judgin' by them soldiers as were pourin' out of the city, I arrived not a moment too soon... Must've been fate that we happened to find *you* there though, eh?

**BREMONDT:** I had thought to look out for Alisaie, but 'twould appear she was the one watching over me. I've made such a mess of things...

**PIPPIN:** An' who might you be, young sir?

**BREMONDT:** Pipin Tarupin, Vice Marshal of the Immortal Flames. I had been on the Ala Mhigan front these past few moons, but an urgent communication called me back to Ul'dah. Scarce had my boots touched the cobbles, though, when the streets erupted with cries of assassination. I immediately went in search of answers, and came across Master Alphinaud here. Needless to say, I did not think his imprisonment justified. The blame plainly lies with the Monetarists. Their greed and corruption are well known to me, but for them to take advantage of the situation with such alacrity...

**PIPPIN:** ...Was that “Pipin,” you said? Ain't that the name of General Aldynn's lad?

**BREMONDT:** Yes, I am his son. Adopted, of course. 'Twas only as we were leaving Ul'dah that I learned of Father's fate. Once I have seen you a safe distance away, I mean to return to the city and extricate him from this madness.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then you needn't travel no further than Black Brush─our fugitives have a friend waitin' for 'em there.

**HAURCHEFANT:** I dreamed of bringing about Eorzea's salvation, but in the end... 'Twas I who needed saving.

**ALPHINAUD:** There has been word from the capital. Ishgard has weathered another assault, and 'tis said several wyverns broke through into the city proper. The Temple Knights succeeded in slaying the beasts, but the intrusion prompted orders to further strengthen the guard and to place the city under a perpetual state of alert. How keenly we feel the loss of our wards at the Gates of Judgement... Yet we must not bemoan our misfortune. Ser Aymeric is safely returned from Ul'dah and once more leads the defense of Ishgard. As for the matter of your asylum, I am afraid no progress will be made until the threat to our nation has diminished. But do not despair! You are not without allies. You are more than welcome to shelter here for as long as you wish. Pray think of it as a new headquarters of sorts─the “Falling Snows” or some such! All frivolity aside, any who come here in search of you will receive no aid from House Fortemps. For once, the Ishgardian reputation for inhospitality shall work in our favor. Agents of Ul'dah will find their every inquiry dismissed, and their every request for entry rebuffed, until such time as their masters have acknowledged your innocence. You once fought to preserve the honor of my dear friend─'tis a blessing that I may now repay that debt in kind. But let us dwell no more on this. Pray join the rest of your companions. 'Tis bitterly cold this day. I suspect there are those who might welcome the warmth your presence brings.

**TATARU:** 'Tis all my doing... I believed myself the only one who truly understood Eorzea's woes. And look what that arrogance has wrought. I gave commands, influenced governments with my certainty... I treated the Crystal Braves, and even the Scions themselves, as pawns in my great scheme to save the realm. But in my headlong rush unto imagined glory, I paid no heed to the ground upon which I trod! The salvation of Eorzea... What was it that I hoped to achieve? Did I believe that I could rid the realm of every danger and difficulty? That I could defeat the Empire and the Ascians, and find homes for every refugee? Oh yes, I was so very clever. “Become a guardian of Eorzea,” I implored, and sat back to watch my perfect army cleanse the land of chaos. 'Twas all but a means to feed my own vanity. Only when all is lost do I finally realize the truth.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Oh, Alphinaud...

**ALPHINAUD:** So, Master Alphinaud, are you content to remain a broken blade? Is there no flame hot enough to reforge you? What of the fine companions who yet stand at your side? I daresay the fires of their determination will soon have you slicing the air again with your customary wit!

**TATARU:** I hardly deserve such friendship. And besides, where are we to go...?

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud? If I may...? Should this place not serve our purpose, then...then we shall go to Ishgard! Minfilia told me many times: as long as we stand fast against despair, the beacon of hope will never be lost to sight. Be it in the snow or in the clouds, we few will see that the dawn's light shines again! <sniff> <sniff>

**LADYINWAITING2:** You are right, Tataru, thank you. And thank you for your kind words, Lord Haurchefant. 'Tis true that Eorzea yet has her guardians. The Scions have achieved much, and 'twould be remiss of me to discard it all in a fit of self-pity. Let us then resume our journey, together...one step at a time.

**LOLORITO:** All has been arranged as you desired, my lord.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Hmph.



---------------------------------------------------------------------




---------------------------------------------------------------------

**HAURCHEFANT:** The dawn's light will shine again... So long as we have these specious accusations hanging over us, we will struggle to achieve anything. You must go to Ishgard, as Tataru proposed. I will return to Ul'dah and set things right.

**ALPHINAUD:** Pray do not be so hasty, Master Alphinaud.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Lord Haurchefant?

**ALPHINAUD:** Full well do I understand your desire to clear your names. But now is not the time for drastic action. You yet have allies upon whom you can rely. There is no need to act alone.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Yes...yes, of course. Pray forgive my impatience.

**ALPHINAUD:** I bring tidings. Count Edmont has decreed that the three of you be taken in as wards of House Fortemps. Under our patronage, you shall be granted access to the city proper. Pray consider our manor your new headquarters, from which you may gather information and plan how best to proceed. Needless to say, should any of your missing allies be found─as I am certain they shall─they will of course be welcome to join you there.

**HAURCHEFANT:** You are more than generous, my friend. On behalf of my fellows, I humbly accept your offer of hospitality.

**ALPHINAUD:** The count is a good man and just. He will treat you with the kindness and respect that a hero─and dear friend─deserves.

**TATARU:** To Ishgard, then─together. There we shall carry on the Scions' legacy. There we shall begin anew.

**EDMONT:** Hear, hear!

**NARRATION:** And so they came, at a friend's behest. Heroes once celebrated as saviors of Eorzea, brought low through treachery,
their names blackened with royal blood... With memories of the lost and dreams of redemption,
with hope yet in their hearts, they came... To Ishgard, shining city on the mount, overlooking the dominion of Coerthas... A great and proud nation devoted to Halone, the Fury, ruled by Thordan VII,
Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church... The last bastion of the Faith, her walls ever bristling with
the sworn swords and spears of her four High Houses... A land that after a thousand years of war
had forgotten what it was to be at peace. Through gates long closed the Warrior of Light and her companions passed,
entering at last a city whose history was written in blood. In the midst of the Dragonsong War they came─three weary travelers
whose arrival would set in motion great change... Though none knew then how great...

**HAURCHEFANT:** From the memoirs of Count Edmont de Fortemps
*Heavensward*

**EDMONT:** My lord, I have returned with the Scions.

**ALPHINAUD:** I hope your journey was not too taxing. I, Count Edmont de Fortemps, do bid you welcome. As wards of House Fortemps, you shall be afforded every courtesy. My home is your home.

**EDMONT:** My companions and I are deeply honored, Count Fortemps.

**ALPHINAUD:** The honor is mine, Master Alphinaud. Consider it an expression of our gratitude for your service to Ishgard.

**EDMONT:** Forgive me, my lord, but...are you not concerned? To accept foreign guests at such a juncture─especially ones with our...reputation...

**ALPHINAUD:** Do not worry yourself on my account. 'Tis true that Ishgard's first thought has ever been the war effort, hence the closing of our borders... ...Yet it is in troubled times most of all that men should seek allies, don't you think? Granted, my decision will have raised eyebrows in the Vault and in the halls of the other High Houses. But so long as you continue with your altruistic endeavors, I doubt my honored peers will feel moved to voice their concerns.

**EDMONT:** Then there is naught to fear. Though our numbers are much reduced, we are no less determined to carry on our work.

**ICEHEART:** Full glad am I to hear it. Ah, but before you return to your labors, why not take a tour of the city? You would do well, I think, to acquaint yourselves with your new surroundings. After all, you may be here for some time. To the frozen wastes of the western highlands,
once verdant tracts made pallid by the Calamity... Beyond the towering wall of ice, to lands long forsaken
that the knights of Ishgard strove tirelessly to reclaim... To the hamlet of Falcon's Nest, once abandoned,
now freed of its pall of snow and ash, she came...

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-Iceheart-)Looking for me, I presume.

**ICEHEART:** Ahhh, the child who glimpsed the truth.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-Iceheart-)No, it cannot be!

**ICEHEART:** She cameth unto me, as didst thou. Alike in gifts, yet set upon different paths.

**000:** (-Iceheart-)He speaks true, Warrior of Light. Like you, I have been blessed with the Echo. (-Iceheart-)The visions terrified me at first. They came without warning. I wondered what I had done to deserve them... (-Iceheart-)But I had no time to ponder such things once the Calamity came. (-Iceheart-)The land turned against us, and in a matter of hours, Falcon's Nest was buried under ten fulms of ice and snow. We had no choice but to flee for Ishgard. (-Iceheart-)We came to the wall, and while we searched for a way through, there was an avalanche. And then I was alone. (-Iceheart-)So I set forth for Dravania. I knew full well what might happen were I found, but I could not survive on my own. (-Iceheart-)I was found, of course─and not by a mere dragon, but by the great wyrm Hraesvelgr! (-Iceheart-)And it was then that I knew why I had been given this gift, for with it I heard his voice, and saw the truth through his eyes! (-Iceheart-)I was chosen to deliver this revelation to the people─to bring dragon and man together, as they once were, and should ever be!

**ICEHEART:** What will you say? Killing civilians won't bring them together! What of the innocents who died when you attacked Foundation?

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-Iceheart-)It wasn't supposed to be like that! You have to believe me! It was...beyond my control... (-Iceheart-)Children taught to fear the skies, who saw their loved ones slaughtered... (-Iceheart-)Yet the Dravanians─though they know where the fault truly lies─fell upon them with such fury...

**ICEHEART:** Men die, and their children forget. But we are everlasting. To us, then is as now. Thou canst not comprehend the violation. The outrage. The fury.

**EDMONT:** (-Iceheart-)I will make this right. (-Iceheart-)I am neither a saint nor a savior─just another sinner. Yet I will not forsake this cause. I cannot. I will see this cycle broken and peace restored. (-Iceheart-)I... We can do naught else, for we are now as one...

**HAURCHEFANT:** Upon an airship conceived within the fecund mind of Cid Garlond,
renegade prodigy of Garlemald who had come to call Eorzea home... High into the heavens where isles of earth and stone floated as clouds─
a frontier the knights of Ishgard had scarce begun to explore... To a fledgling outpost within the Sea of Clouds where careworn scouts
ever scanned the skies for winged shadows, she came...

**HONU:** Reinforcements!?

**HAURCHEFANT:** Anger of Honu, chief of mighty Vundu, roils like blackest storm clouds! Offer netherlings to the White! Cloud sea swells and He comes! The White! The White! Mighty Bismarck, Lord of the Mists!

**CID:** A flying whale!? By the Fury, i-it's a primal! We must away! Damn!

**BIGGSWEDGE:** Bloody typical... All right─we're going in!

**CID:** (-Biggs and Wedge-)Aye aye, chief!

**EDMONT:** All aboard!

**HOUSEFORTEMPSSTEWARD:** The hero returns! I cannot thank you enough for saving young Emmanellain's life. Aye, aye─he told me everything. I've also received letters from both House Dzemael and Durendaire praising your conduct─and that of House Fortemps. You've won us much honor, my friend.

**EDMONT:** My lord!

**HOUSEFORTEMPSSTEWARD:** What is it? Speak.

**EDMONT:** Pray forgive the intrusion, my lord, but I-I bring grave tidings! Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru have been detained on suspicion of fomenting heresy!

**HOUSEFORTEMPSSTEWARD:** What? Explain!

**EDMONT:** They...they were observed entering a tavern in the lower levels on some half-dozen occasions. There, it is claimed, they made a number of inquiries... Inquiries which brought them into contact with certain...ahem...elements. 'Twas this which prompted a knight of the Heavens' Ward to demand that they be questioned. Ser Grinnaux, my lord...

**TRIALOFFICIANT:** Ser Grinnaux is a brute─an exceedingly accomplished brute, but a brute nonetheless. Alas, he is also a son of House Dzemael. How quickly we forget the petty nature of men. I'd wager your friends are no more than pawns in another of my countrymen's games. Such is the way of things between the High Houses...

**GRINNAUX:** We are gathered here today, under the watchful gaze of the Fury, to ascertain the guilt of two souls in a trial by combat! Petitioners, step forward! Ser Grinnaux─for the benefit of all here present, I would ask you to repeat the charges which you have leveled against this man and this woman.

**TRIALOFFICIANT:** I, Ser Grinnaux de Dzemael, brother of the Heavens' Ward, did bear witness to these two foreigners consorting with heretics!

**ALPHINAUD:** Let the accused step forward! Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru─you have heard the charges leveled against you. Will you take up arms to refute Ser Grinnaux's claim and thereby prove your innocence in the eyes of gods and men?

**TATARU:** I, Alphinaud Leveilleur, am innocent of this charge, and claim my right to trial by combat!

**TRIALOFFICIANT:** I, Tataru Taru, am innocent of this charge... But I am no warrior, and cannot fight, so I claim the right to name a champion!

**ALPHINAUD:** To the old and the infirm, the young and the weak, this right we allow. Very well. Who will stand for this woman?

**TRIALOFFICIANT:** Just as I was beginning to doubt the efficacy of the Ishgardian justice system! Come, my friend─let us put an end to this mummer's farce!

**AYMERIC:** O Halone, render unto us Your judgment! Raise up the righteous, and cast down the wicked!

**THORDAN:** Your Eminence, it is my honor to present to you the Warrior of Light.

**ZEPHIRIN:** I have heard the tales of your many grand endeavors. The lord commander has also been most effusive in his praise. I am Thordan VII, Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, and I bade you come here that I might offer my personal apologies.  You will forgive me for not calling upon you as courtesy would dictate, but as you can see, my more sprightly days are long behind me. But I digress. Your companions were wrongly accused of heresy and subjected to gross indignities. This, I am sorry to say, was the result of negligence on the part of our nation's protectors─negligence born of an excess of zeal. Is that not so, Ser Zephirin?

**THORDAN:** Yes, Your Eminence... Regrettably, it would appear that we of the Heavens' Ward were in receipt of erroneous information. Ser Grinnaux has ever been headstrong. He pressed charges before the truth had been ascertained, for which I most sincerely apologize.

**ZEPHIRIN:** An unfortunate misunderstanding born of an earnest desire to serve Ishgard─but one which should never have occurred... For who could doubt the character of those who bested Shiva and drove the Horde from the Steps of Faith? Not I, that much is certain. That will be all, Ser Zephirin. I would speak with our guest in private.

**THORDAN:** Your Eminence? I─ As you wish, Your Eminence. That will be all for today!

**ALPHINAUD:** Privacy is a luxury rarely afforded one in my position. Now, tell me, young lady: what do you know of the Ascians? Much and more, I shouldn't wonder, being the Bringer of Light. You should know that I myself have met with them─have entertained them as guests, even. Those harbingers of chaos and strife offered us power, that we might continue our war against the dragons. I have no intention of aiding their cause, of course, nor less of being their puppet. Yet were I to refuse them outright, I should learn naught of their true objectives and remain powerless to stop them. Thus have I hearkened to their words with interest, and paid lip service to their beliefs, biding my time and preparing for the inevitable conflict. And why do I tell you this? Because there is naught in this world they fear more than the power of the Warrior of Light. If we are to rid ourselves of these vile interlopers, we must needs work together. With our combined strength, I have faith that we can wrest Eorzea from their grasp, and pave the way for a lasting peace. Think on it.

**TATARU:** There you are. I confess, I was more than a little concerned when I learned that you had been summoned to the Vault. What did they want with you? Well, well. A formal apology and an admonishment of those responsible? I see my fears were wholly misplaced. By the gods, the archbishop freely admits to consorting with Ascians? So their ambitions extend to Ishgard as well... We will have new primals to contend with ere long, of that you may be certain. 'Tis but a matter of time. Yet shorn of the support of our missing allies, what can we realistically hope to achieve?

**ALPHINAUD:** Ahhh! In the midst of all the excitement, I completely forgot to tell you! When I was asking around about the Scions, I heard the most awful rumor! General Raubahn is to be executed for crimes against the sultanate!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALPHINAUD:** Friends. 'Tis good to see you safe and well. I will admit, I had not counted on you seeking─let alone finding─refuge within the Holy See, but full glad was I to learn that you had.

**MERLWYB:** Thankfully, we had allies there who took us under their wing. And theirs was not the only aid we received, I suspect. When we fled Ul'dah, we fully expected to become wanted men, known to all and hounded at every turn. Yet that did not come to pass. On the contrary, 'twould seem the charges against us have not been made public. Might we have you to thank for that, Admiral?

**ALPHINAUD:** Sharp as ever, Master Alphinaud. On Marshal Tarupin's urging, the Elder Seedseer and I demanded that the Syndicate suppress news of the Scions' alleged crimes until such time as irrefutable evidence could be found. Our argument was simple: lacking proof, to accuse the saviors of the realm of so unlikely a crime would have the people up in arms. In their wisdom, the Syndicate agreed, as you yourself have seen. There is something you should know. Some few days prior to the banquet, the Elder Seedseer and I were summoned for a private audience with the sultana. There, she revealed her intent to announce her abdication, that she might pave the way for the establishment of an Ul'dahn republic.

**MERLWYB:** What? But such an announcement would have plunged the entire nation into chaos!

**ALPHINAUD:** She was well aware of that. 'Twas for fear of what might ensue that she summoned us. Her Grace wanted the Elder Seedseer and I to lend Raubahn a helping hand, you see─to aid him in preserving the peace during the transition.

**EYNZAHRSLAFYRSYN:** So...having somehow caught wind of her plan, Lolorito and Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination in the hope of maintaining the constitutional status quo...? But they must have known that her death would sow as much chaos as her abdication─chaos from which Teledji alone might feasibly stand to profit. Surely Lolorito would never knowingly─ Ah. Could it be...? I dare not hope...

**MERLWYB:** The Ul'dahn authorities have yet to announce the sultana's passing. To allay any suspicion that may arise from Her Grace's absence, they have issued a statement to the effect that she is presently convalescing from illness.

**ALPHINAUD:** Mayhap they're waiting for a fitting moment to break the news. Or mayhap they know of some other reason to delay.

**MERLWYB:** Something else has been bothering me, Admiral. I was dismayed to learn that General Raubahn is to be executed─yet upon hearing the news, I could not help but wonder why he had been kept alive for so long. Pray mistake not my meaning─I am, of course, overjoyed that our friend still draws breath, and that he might yet be saved. But if his enemies truly wished to eliminate him, they could have done so immediately. I see no reason for this delay.

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye... You've struck upon an important point, Master Alphinaud. Following his capture, Raubahn had been held in the Marasaja Pit within Ul'dah. In recent days, however, he has reportedly been moved to an unknown location. Queerly, 'twas not the Brass Blades who spirited him away, either, but a band of soldiers decked in blue...

**MERLWYB:** The Crystal Braves.

**YUGIRI:** Aye. If I read the winds aright, the arrangement between Lord Lolorito and the Braves has come under strain. At any rate, if we're to rescue Raubahn, we'll have to find him first. And you'll be glad to hear that I have already entrusted the task to those best able to see it done─our friends of Doma.

**ALPHINAUD:** Pray forgive me my lateness.

**YUGIRI:** Lady Yugiri!

**ALPHINAUD:** Master Alphinaud. I am pleased to see that the light of resolve shines in your eyes once more.

**YUGIRI:** Ah, yes... How pathetic I must have seemed to you when we last met. I am ashamed to recall it. For a time I was well and truly lost. But with the aid of my comrades, I have since refound my purpose, and I shall take care not to misplace it again.

**ALPHINAUD:** Since your escape from Ul'dah, my fellow shinobi and I have shadowed the Crystal Braves' every step in hopes of learning the Scions' whereabouts. Regrettably, our investigation has yet to yield any useful information. Pray forgive us.

**YUGIRI:** You need not apologize, my lady─we are grateful for all that you have done on our behalf. Besides, Raubahn is no less a friend, and we cannot well abandon him to his fate.

**ILBERD:** Hozan─the three of us shall attend to the Flame General's rescue. Pray draw away the guards by the entrance. Take Doware and Higiri with you. With me!

**ALPHINAUD:** This changes nothing!

**ILBERD:** It is over, Ilberd! Lay down your arms and surrender yourself to justice!

**ALPHINAUD:** Justice!? Justice for what exactly? 'Twas not I who assassinated the sultana, boy!

**ILBERD:** Ere we debate who is responsible for the assassination, I would ask whether an assassination took place at all.

**ALPHINAUD:** Clever little shite... If you think you fight for justice, lass, you'd best wake up. The truth is, you fight for whoever bloody well tells you to. Can you not see you're being used!? By the Scions, the city–states, even the Crystal Braves. They none of 'em care a whit what you want─only what you can do for them. And how do I know this? Because I'm the same─a pawn to be used as my masters see fit. All I ever wanted was to liberate my homeland, and I ate dirt to make it happen. But what have I achieved after all these years in servitude? Nothing! Not a bloody thing. If we ourselves are not free─free to think and to act─how are we ever to reclaim our homeland? Know this: there is nothing I would not give to take back Ala Mhigo! NOTHING!

**YUGIRI:** You'll not get away!

**RAUBAHN:** No, Master Alphinaud. Now is not the time.

**ALPHINAUD:** I'm but a cripple and a fool, and still you came for me... I'm in your debt.

**000:** We are all of us fools of fate, General. But even fools have a part to play.

**RAUBAHN:** What will you say to Raubahn? We stand with you. On your feet, gladiator. This fight is not over.

**ALPHINAUD:** Rest assured, I was not planning to die till I'd avenged the sultana... Still, your words are welcome, lass. Know this, Ilberd... There is nothing I would not give to see you pay for what you've done. My wealth, my arm, my life...nothing.

**RAUBAHN:** General─are you aware that Lord Lolorito has yet to announce the sultana's death to the public?

**ALPHINAUD:** ...What? No. No, I was not aware of that─nor of anything else outside my cell. 'Tis passing strange, though... I assumed the bastard would make it known at the first opportunity and set about tearing down the sultanate.

**RAUBAHN:** As did we all. And it is indeed strange that he did not─strange or perhaps revealing? Now, I have no conclusive proof, nor do I wish to give you false hope...but I have reason to believe that Her Grace may yet live.

**YUGIRI:** What? But how can that be?

**URIANGER:** Forgive me, friends, but it is not safe here. Let us continue this conversation without.

**PIPPIN:** My dearest friends! Praise be unto the Twelve for delivering you from the clutches of treachery.

**RAUBAHN:** Father!

**PIPPIN:** Pipin, my son... And Master Papashan besides...

**DEWLALA:** Forgive me, Father... I should have been at Her Grace's side...

**RAUBAHN:** (-???-)Save your tears. The sultana yet lives.

**DEWLALA:** You...

**RAUBAHN:** (-???-)It was I who arranged this gathering. And judging by your perplexed expressions, it would seem introductions are in order. I am Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal, and member of the Syndicate.

**DEWLALA:** What you said about the sultana─is it true? Is she alive?

**RAUBAHN:** Young lady─I understand you were with the sultana when she drank from the poisoned goblet and collapsed. Would I be correct in assuming that you did not personally verify Her Grace's vital signs?

**DEWLALA:** Why ask, when 'tis plain you know the answer!

**RAUBAHN:** Calm yourself, General, and let me finish. The truth is not as you imagine it. You are all victims of a most ingenious ruse─a ruse conceived to eliminate the threat posed by Teledji Adeledji. 'Tis my belief that Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination alone, but that Lolorito caught wind of his plot, and exploited it to his own ends. He sought to manipulate you into eliminating Teledji for him, and you duly obliged. At one fell swoop, he removed his two foremost rivals, all the while remaining above suspicion.

**DEWLALA:** Gods strike me down for a fool... But the sultana─how can it be that she lives?

**URIANGER:** She lives because Lolorito willed it. Her own lady-in-waiting is but one of his many little birds; by her sleight of hand, the poison was switched for a less deadly draft before it could reach her mistress's lips.

**DEWLALA:** Some manner of sedative, perchance...of a potency sufficient to induce a slumber like unto death.

**RAUBAHN:** Were I to guess, I would say Her Grace is being held somewhere, dreaming dreams of a brighter Ul'dah, even as we speak.

**DEWLALA:** Oh, Nanamo... I will never forgive Lolorito for his part in this.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**TATARU:** Ishgard cannot well endure another assault. Even should her knights succeed in turning back the Horde, the casualties will be catastrophic.

**ALPHINAUD:** But what other choice do we have? It's not like we can talk it over with them. Dragons and men aren't exactly on speaking terms.

**TATARU:** ...With certain notable exceptions.

**ALPHINAUD:** You don't mean...Iceheart!?

**ESTINIEN:** When last you spoke with her, she lamented her crimes, did she not? Then there remains a sliver of hope. If we can persuade Iceheart to act as our intermediary, we may yet be able to convince Nidhogg to abandon his bloody course.

**ALPHINAUD:** If there is to be a meeting, I would accompany you.

**ESTINIEN:** ...Estinien!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Even with your intermediary, Nidhogg's bloodrage may render him deaf to reason. However, the mere attempt may afford our forces precious time to prepare.  Of course...you might also consider a more direct approach to ending this conflict. With the power of the Eye at my disposal, and the vaunted strength of the Warrior of Light, we could conceivably slay the beast outright...

**ESTINIEN:** If we are to risk a face-to-face meeting with the dread wyrm, I for one would feel safer in the company of the Azure Dragoon. However, I should only turn to your lance if my words failed to find their mark. Is that clear?

**ALPHINAUD:** Perfectly. I shall assume that Iceheart enjoys similar diplomatic protection until instructed otherwise. A word of advice: think carefully before divulging the particulars of this plan to Ser Aymeric. 'Twould not do to have the lord commander accused of consorting with heretics.

**ESTINIEN:** Indeed. I thank you for your counsel, Estinien. We shall be honored to have you with us.

**AYMERIC:** I am glad to be of service.

**YOUNGTEMPLEKNIGHT:** I want the defenses of the outer ward rechecked. See to it that the ballistas are in good repair and supplied with enough ammunition for a prolonged siege.

**AYMERIC:** At once, my lord!

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, 'twould seem I have visitors─and unlike those massing beyond our walls, these ones are welcome.

**AYMERIC:** Pray forgive us for interrupting you in the midst of your preparations, Ser Aymeric, but our suit concerns the impending assault. To speak plain, we believe there is a chance the invasion might be halted before it even begins. I can divulge little more at this time, but I must nevertheless request that you advise the Holy See to refrain from launching any preemptive sorties whilst we seek to put our plans in motion.

**ESTINIEN:** I will gladly lend my support to any endeavor that could spare the blood of my countrymen─but I would know more of the cause you would have me champion. Will you not share aught of this mysterious undertaking?

**AYMERIC:** Know that I have offered my lance to aid in this endeavor. I cannot claim that its success is assured, but our actions should serve to delay Nidhogg's advance at the very least. Which is more than can be said for the ill-conceived counterattack advocated by the See's more vocal crusaders. They offer glorious death, but little hope of victory.

**THORDAN:** Aye...their proposal does not inspire confidence. Our resources should rightly be spent shoring up the city's defenses. Hmmm. The Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light, sallying forth together to face the dread wyrm, Nidhogg... I must admit, the mere thought of it does much to dispel my misgivings. Go, then─carry out your plan. I shall do what I can for you within the Holy See.

**ZEPHIRIN:** Such commotion...

**THORDAN:** Yes, Your Eminence. The bells of the Observatorium warn of our enemy's approach...

**ZEPHIRIN:** So...the dragons are coming. Let them come─in their hundreds and their thousands. With the divine blade in our hands, we shall rend their flesh and drown the heretics in their masters' blood. Even Nidhogg and his foul brood shall be powerless to resist us. And when we have rid the world of their pestilence, we shall turn our attention to our Ascian allies─see that they are suitably rewarded for their invaluable assistance.

**THORDAN:** If I may, Your Eminence. The Paragons wield powers strange and unknowable. Can we be certain that they will not see through our deception?

**ZEPHIRIN:** We can be certain of naught save the righteousness of our cause. If you would be a true leader of men, you must possess conviction as well as caution. We seek to excise the root of an evil that has blighted us for a thousand years. The risk is worth the reward.

**THORDAN:** And what of Estinien and this Warrior of Light? They have plans of their own...

**ZEPHIRIN:** Leave them to their purpose. We must each play the role we have been given...you and your chosen brothers most of all.

**ICEHEART:** For the glory of King Thordan...

**000:** (-Iceheart-)Ah, I should have known it would be you... (-Iceheart-)Word reached me of a struggle with a small but well-armed band of trespassers. Forgive my comrades their hostility─few come here uninvited, and fewer still with good intent. (-Iceheart-)Now, tell me why you are here.

**ICEHEART:** What will you say to Lady Iceheart? We wish to stop Nidhogg's attack on Ishgard. We wished to speak with you. It's a long story...

**ESTINIEN:** (-Iceheart-)So, you seek to stem the Dravanian tide with talk? A romantic notion. (-Iceheart-)If you but knew the truth─the spark which lit the flames of this animosity─you would understand the futility of your quest. (-Iceheart-)Shall I relate it to you? The sordid history my gift has shown me? That which the Holy See has taken such pains to suppress? (-Iceheart-)'Twas more than a millennium past when an Elezen tribe first sought to claim the lands of Coerthas as its home. (-Iceheart-)Unfortunately for them, Coerthas was already home to dragonkind, and they were not inclined to make way for the invaders. Thus did a bloody war begin─a war which might well have rumbled on until one or the other side was exterminated, had it not been for the resolve of a single woman. That woman's name was “Shiva.” (-Iceheart-)While those around her fought and died, she attempted to parley with the dragons, and in so doing discovered them to be possessed of profound intelligence and reason. The great wyrm Hraesvelgr in particular so enchanted Shiva that she found herself growing to love the creature, whom her people considered a monster. (-Iceheart-)In the eyes of a near-immortal dragon, however, the fleeting life of an Elezen is as that of a freshly cut rose─scarce has the flower bloomed before it begins to fade and wither. (-Iceheart-)Such melancholy musings plagued Hraesvelgr, who had found in Shiva an unexpected and beloved soulmate. He knew that all too soon, death would snatch her away from him. (-Iceheart-)Unable to bear the thought of their separation, the maid bid the wyrm consume her, that their spirits might be entwined for eternity. (-Iceheart-)...Though loath to perform the deed, Hraesvelgr ultimately gave in to her plea, and soon thereafter, the tale of their ill-fated love spread throughout the two warring factions. No more could they raise blade or claw against one another, knowing that the souls of their kin were so inextricably bound. (-Iceheart-)In the days that followed, man and dragon learned to live in harmony, and together built a nation unlike any the world had ever known. For two hundred years did this blissful age of peace continue, as it would to this day, had vilest envy not stirred in the hearts of the Elezen. (-Iceheart-)It is said that wyrms owe their longevity to the boundless reserves of vitality found within their eyes─and 'twas in this belief that a traitorous band of knights deceived their allies of some two centuries, and took by force that which they coveted... (-Iceheart-)Nidhogg─he who now stands poised to unleash his wyrmlings upon Ishgard─was the great dragon who lost an eye to Elezen treachery. (-Iceheart-)And until he prises it from the hands of the traitors' progeny, no amount of conciliatory words will stay his fury.

**ALPHINAUD:** You are wrong, Lady Iceheart. Lest you misunderstand, I do not doubt your vision of the past─'tis true that Nidhogg greatly desired to reclaim the Eye. Indeed, it was for that very reason that I kept it with me as I roamed the land, attempting to draw him away from the city.

**ESTINIEN:** Good gods...

**ICEHEART:** Until recently, Nidhogg seemed unable to resist its allure, and pursued me relentlessly. Needless to say, that is no longer the case. Now, it would seem he has fixed his attention on Ishgard itself, though he knows full well the Eye does not reside there.

**ESTINIEN:** (-Iceheart-)You believe he targets the capital for another reason...?

**ALPHINAUD:** I believe reason has all but left him. Through the Eye, I feel much of what Nidhogg feels, and the dragon's thirst for vengeance will not be quenched by aught less than a sea of blood.

**ICEHEART:** If Nidhogg is indeed lost to reason, might we not seek an audience with Hraesvelgr instead? He has thus far shown no inclination to aid in the invasion of Ishgard, and may yet welcome our efforts to broker a peace.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Iceheart-)You *still* believe that a peaceable solution can be found? Very well. I will take you to him. (-Iceheart-)Our road will lead us to Dravania, the homeland of dragonkind. There we shall ascend unto the clouds, where Hraesvelgr resides...

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Is aught amiss, my friend? I sense the many battles are beginning to take their toll. Rest awhile. And should you lose sight of us─Dravania lies beyond the mountains to the west.

**EDMONT:** Curious... The vestiges of thy mistress's blessing are not as faint as once they were... Thy will to succeed grants thee unusual fortitude. But will it be enough...?

**ICEHEART:** Beyond Abalathia's Spine─the great mountain range
that spans the continent of Aldenard from east to west... Into the deepening shadows of Sohm Al,
where lies the ancient home of dragonkind... To a land where the soil slithers, and the skies seethe
with sinuous shapes, they came.

**VIDOFNIR:** Vidofnir!

**ICEHEART:** Ah, 'tis thee, Little One. From above, I did mistake thee for a Gnath. 'Tis well I chanced to look again, or thou wouldst now be ash.

**VIDOFNIR:** Dear Vidofnir...how I have missed you. Would that I had come sooner...and not out of dire necessity.

**ICEHEART:** Thou art troubled. Speak, that I might know thy plight. Thou wouldst have Father admonish his brood-brother?

**VIDOFNIR:** I would end this war without further bloodshed.

**ESTINIEN:** How am I to believe thee, Little One...when thine own companion beareth Nidhogg's stolen eye!?

**ICEHEART:** Have care, dragon...or I shall gouge out one of yours.

**VIDOFNIR:** You forget yourself, ser! We are here on a mission of peace!

**ICEHEART:** My sire's will forbiddeth me from inviting discord to our home... 'Tis for this reason, and no other, that thou still drawest breath, knight.

**VIDOFNIR:** Vidofnir, please─we must be allowed to convey our intentions to Hraesvelgr in person, with words of our own choosing. Grant us this favor, and open the way to Sohm Al!

**ICEHEART:** Thou hast ever been welcome, Little One. ...But I cannot grant thy wish. I am bound to remain here, and protect my kin from the Gnath's god.

**ALPHINAUD:** The Gnath have summoned a primal!?

**VIDOFNIR:** Pray excuse my forwardness, but if we were to eliminate the threat to your territory, would you consent to Lady Ysayle's request?

**ICEHEART:** Ha! Dost thou imagine thyself equal to the task─to succeed where dragons have failed? 'Tis beyond thee, mortal. But thou art welcome to try, nonetheless. Only know that idle promises shall avail thee naught!

**GNATHPRIEST:** It would seem we have no choice but to make good on Alphinaud's offer. Why must our every bid for peace breed yet more war? Now we have but to wait...

**ICEHEART:** O Lord Ravana! Master of the Sacred Blades! Wrath of the Colony! Conqueror of the World! Hear our prayer! Pray grant unto Your devoted children the gift of Your divine presence!

**RAVANA:** He comes!

**GNATHPRIEST:** All strength to the colony. Speak and I shall listen!

**RAVANA:** O Glorious General! We have captured intruders, and would make unto You an offering of their life's blood...

**ICEHEART:** These feeble fleshlings dared to invade Gnath lands?

**RAVANA:** Hear me, Lord Ravana! My companion and I did not come to contest your children's territory. We wished only to learn the reason you wage war against the dragons.

**ICEHEART:** Thou wouldst flirt with death merely to satisfy thy curiosity? Wherefore should the glorious conquests of the Gnath concern thee so, Elezen? ...Ahhh, mayhap thine own kind's struggle against the wyrms fareth poorly, and thou art desirous of a pact.

**RAVANA:** We crave no alliance, Lord Ravana─only peace. We would bring an end to our war with the dragons. Yet so long as they remain embroiled in this conflict with your children, our goal shall remain out of reach. Never before have the Gnath risen up in such numbers, and never yet with you at their head. Why do you lead them to war?

**ICEHEART:** Thy question hath no meaning. To live is but to fight. Long have my children waited, gathering their strength in the shadow of thy ceaseless conflict. The Gnath would see the Dravanians slain, and their territory secured─and by such fervent prayers am I now given form and purpose.

**RAVANA:** As I feared, your very existence is an obstacle to our goal. Since you are so fond of fighting, we challenge you, Lord of the Gnath! And should we emerge the victors, I would have you swear to withdraw your soldiers from Dravanian soil!

**ICEHEART:** Gahahaha! Thou art bold indeed to risk thy fleshy hide so readily! Very well. I, Ravana, fourfold master of the blade, do accept thy challenge! But should *I* emerge the victor, I would have thee swear to serve in mine army till thy last breath is spent! Do you accept!?

**RAVANA:** I do! And I believe the first bout is mine!

**ICEHEART:** What is this!? A god clad in flesh!?

**RAVANA:** Is aught amiss, my lord? Thou wilt not break thy word, I trust.

**ICEHEART:** Mine oath is unbending as steel, little goddess! Thy ruse will but add to mine enjoyment!

**RAVANA:** I thought myself...stronger... Mayhap with more crystals...?

**ICEHEART:** Be thou god or maid, thou art nothing to me! ...And what of thee, mortal? Art thou warrior or craven? A warrior, then! Good! Mayhap thou wilt provide more sport than thy feeble companion! Thus doth the sacred rite of combat proclaim the victor...
I lay my blades at thy feet, child of man...

**IGEYOHRM:** You do not disappoint, Warrior of Light. Would that I had your skill in battle. ...I do begin to see why so many place their faith in you. For all his savagery, I do not think Ravana one to break his word. Provided the dragons do not trespass upon Gnath lands, they should have little to fear of the primal's biting blades. We have done well, have we not? Come, let us return to Vidofnir and share these glad tidings.

**EDMONT:** Once more you achieve the impossible, Bringer of Light... But with every mortal heart that succumbs to fear and fury, another voice is joined to the chorus beseeching divine succor. At their bidding, warring gods will shake the firmament, and your world will be consumed in the swelling storm of chaos...

**HRAESVELGR:** To the peak of Sohm Al, at the end of a perilous mountain path... Whence could be seen a string of pearl-like islands,
floating impossibly atop a sea of clouds. To a domain where dragons and men had once lived in harmony, whose majesty
no mortal eye had glimpsed for nigh on a thousand years, they came.

**ALPHINAUD:** Mortals... Why do you disturb my solitude?

**HRAESVELGR:** Hraesvelgr...

**ALPHINAUD:** Thou speakest the name of a creature that but awaiteth the release of oblivion. Leave me...

**ICEHEART:** By the Twelve... Mine ears hear the tongue of dragons, yet the meaning rings clear within my mind... How can that be...?

**HRAESVELGR:** Hraesvelgr...do you not remember me? 'Twas I whom you found in Dravania─I who glimpsed the truth. The truth about your past, about Shiva─

**ICEHEART:** Do not speak her name, mortal!

**HRAESVELGR:** But speak it I must! I have summoned Shiva's soul from the beyond, and offered myself as her vessel! She has made her heart known to me!

**ICEHEART:** Foolish girl. Thinkest thou my beloved's spirit hath descended from the heavens!? That the secrets of her heart are thine to know!?

**HRAESVELGR:** I have surrendered mine to her! Do you not see, my love? I am Shiva reborn!

**ICEHEART:** Gullible fool... The Light but illuminated the past for thee, it did not grant thee omniscience. The spirit thou hast summoned belongeth not to Shiva─'tis but a shade conjured by thine own fancy. In an age long past, mine own kin were guilty of like folly. Beguiled by the dark ones' lies, they attempted to resurrect a king amongst wyrms─yet the divinity they called forth merely borrowed the semblance of my fallen brood-brother. Such gods are not summoned, but created. Phantoms spun from the threads of misplaced faith.

**HRAESVELGR:** Then the spirit that answered me...

**ALPHINAUD:** ...Was but thy dream of Shiva. Thy soul hath been corrupted by a deity of thine own making, child.

**HRAESVELGR:** Be that as it may, Lord Hraesvelgr, Ysayle's desire to heal the rift between man and dragon is real, and it has borne us this far. We would spare both our kind and yours the ravages of this senseless war! Pray join your voice to ours in a call for peace and forgiveness!

**ESTINIEN:** The tale of thy kind is one of avarice, treachery, and death─and thou wouldst speak to me of peace? Hark thee, mortal, to the naked truth...then tell me thou deservest forgiveness! Twelve hundred years ago, my beloved Shiva's sacrifice served to bring an end to the war 'twixt man and dragon, paving the way for an age of peace and cooperation. Two centuries of harmony were to follow, during which time the Elezen learned much about us, not least that the eyes of a great wyrm are the wellspring of his strength. 'Twas out of the selfish desire to possess this strength that King Thordan then conspired to undo all that our peoples had achieved together. With the aid of his leal knights, that most noble of Elezen lured my brood-sister Ratatoskr into an ambush, and took from her that which he craved. Fain would I strike the image from my mind, yet still the scene doth linger─of my brood-sister's tattered corpse, defiled by her Elezen allies. They had torn out her eyes, and feasted upon them in the manner of wild beasts. Yet that was not all, for from their bloody banquet, the fiends had gained strength beyond that of mortal men... Even now, I labor to comprehend the enormity of their betrayal. Nidhogg was the first to learn of the atrocity, and he took to the skies, hungry for vengeance. But though he slew Thordan and some few of his knights, their fellow butchers knew only too well where to aim their spears, and with now-practiced savagery, they set about my brood-brother, sending him flailing from the field... Such is the truth the Holy See would keep hidden. Such was the beginning of the Dragonsong War. 'Tis a song my kind shall ne'er forget, e'en should ten thousand years pass and Ishgard crumble into dust.

**HRAESVELGR:** Your tale bears scant resemblance to the one I was taught. How convenient that it should absolve your kind of all responsibility. But tell me, dragon: why should I believe your version of events?

**ALPHINAUD:** What thou choosest to believe is immaterial. The betrayal that yet haunts mine every waking moment is no less than the truth to my kind. And Nidhogg meaneth for Thordan's people to suffer for this sin till the end of days. That which thou imaginest a war of extinction is but a punishment─a siege of the spirit. Hast thou not seen those who tire of the torment? Those who abandon their own and side with dragonkind?

**HRAESVELGR:** Ishgard's so-called heretics...

**ICEHEART:** Know that all the traitors' progeny bear a trace of Ratatoskr's essence. But a single sip of our blood is enough to awaken it...

**HRAESVELGR:** Then...the seed lies within us...?

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Tis for this reason that those who abandon their loyalties are rewarded with a drink. And thus are they transformed, to join the ranks of Nidhogg's ever-growing army as newborn dragons. One by one, through death or defection, my brood-brother shall account for all of the betrayers' children...

**HRAESVELGR:** Ye gods... I have borne witness to such a transformation! Looked on as a heretic assumed the shape of a dragon... I imagined it some manner of Dravanian enchantment! But if any Ishgardian, regardless of allegiance, has such potential within them... Twelve forgive us. To think of all the dragons we've slain...!

**ESTINIEN:** There will always be some, of course, who choose to fight until the bitter end─like thee, dragoon... But struggle as thou might, thy youthful vigor will be spent ere thou reachest two score and ten. And Nidhogg shall remain to torment thine offspring.

**HRAESVELGR:** Oft have I wondered why Nidhogg did not simply raze Ishgard to the ground. Now I have my answer. He has no intention of winning the Dragonsong War, for it is no war at all, but vengeance─an eternal requiem sung for his murdered sister.

**ICEHEART:** Thou hast the right of it, dragonslayer. Comprehendest thou now the futility of thy quest?

**HRAESVELGR:** I have not come this far only to admit defeat. We can still return the Eye to Nidhogg, and beg forgiveness for our ancestors' crimes. Mayhap our words will sway him!

**ESTINIEN:** Stubborn child... Thou thinkest in mortal terms. Our perception of time is too broad for thee to grasp. 'Tis a simple matter for thee to offer thine apologies─thou didst not perpetrate the crime. Despite thy visions, the deeds of history seem distant to thee. For a wyrm such as Nidhogg, however, that history is yet part of his present, as fresh as the blood that did gush from Ratatoskr's wounds. How could he not be driven mad? 'Tis only by the calming embrace of Shiva's soul that mine own fury hath not consumed me. But let us speak no more of what is done. My faith in your kind is spent, and I would be alone.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, what do you propose we do now? I, for one, am intent on continuing to the east...

**ESTINIEN:** What is there to be found in the east?

**ICEHEART:** Nidhogg's lair─the Aery─is said to lie in that direction. And the Eye tells me he is near...

**ESTINIEN:** You cannot still mean to slay him!?

**ICEHEART:** You cannot still mean to stop me. I have been true to my word, and aided you in this fool's errand with Hraesvelgr. But your efforts at parley have come to naught, Lady Iceheart. I would see Ishgard saved, and for that, Nidhogg must die.

**ESTINIEN:** With the tale of our ancestors' vile betrayal yet ringing in your ears, you speak of continuing this war?

**ALPHINAUD:** Nay, lady, I would but pierce its vengeful heart. When Nidhogg dies, this war shall die with him.

**ESTINIEN:** A moment, Estinien. You yourself spoke of the great wyrm's strength─that you believed him powerful enough to raze your city to the ground. How then are we few to challenge him? Even behind the stout walls of Ishgard─with an army of knights manning the defenses─our victory would be hard-won. Yet you propose to contend with the beast in his own lair?

**ALPHINAUD:** In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And if the tales are true, the Warrior of Light has bested many an invincible foe. In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And with two Azure Dragoons working in unison, who can say what might be possible? But such speculation is meaningless if we cannot even find the wyrm. Our first task must be to seek out Nidhogg's lair.

**ESTINIEN:** The story of this nation grows bloodier by the moment. Must death always be answered with more of the same?

**ICEHEART:** Such is the way of things, I fear. I shall consider it a miracle if mine armor is not stained crimson ere this conflict is ended.

**ESTINIEN:** That I should be blinded by my own lies... Everything I believed... Everything I thought I was... Gone... All gone...

**ALPHINAUD:** Leave her. Your words will not reach her now. And we have not the time to wait for her to gather up the pieces of her shattered faith.

**ESTINIEN:** Is that it?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye... That would be the Aery. I feel Nidhogg's presence through the Eye─his caustic hatred gnawing at my soul. 'Twould seem the death of his consort has put him on guard. Mark how he wards his lair with tempestuous winds.

**WEDGE:** A similar barrier once barred our entrance to the primal Garuda's domain...until we discovered the means by which it could be penetrated. Mayhap it is time we called upon Master Garlond. 'Twill be just like the good old days, no?

**BIGGS:** Feast your eyes upon our latest and greatest feat of engineering! We call it a “manacutter”!

**CID:** After you put down Gaius, Wedge and me struck out on our own for a bit, and started work on the successor to the *Tiny Bronco*.

**WEDGE:** Impressive little thing, isn't she? My talent for ship design has plainly rubbed off on them. They've adapted the principles of corrupted crystal technology, and constructed a mechanism which converts aether from its surroundings into elemental wind. Said wind is then harnessed by the specially engineered sails, providing the craft with propulsion and lift. All in all, a most elegant solution... ...I'm actually a little upset that I didn't think of it myself.

**BIGGS:** The design does, however, come with one small flaw...

**WEDGE:** The energy conversion ratio's bloody awful. To generate enough power to get you off the ground, you need to be in an area awash with predominantly wind-aspected aether.

**CID:** In other words, there are a few places you can fly...and lots of places you can't.

**TATARU:** The new Ishgardian airship hasn't left the boys much time for tinkering─meaning it may be a while before this particular project takes off, if you'll forgive the pun.

**WEDGE:** Hah...hah...hah...

**TATARU:** Tataru, what's happened!?

**CID:** I've been looking all over for you! There's been word from Ul'dah! It's about Her Grace, the sultana!

**RAUBAHN:** It seems you're required elsewhere. Leave the manacutter with us. We'll see that she's airworthy and suitably equipped to slice through those winds. You, meanwhile, should concentrate on providing Raubahn and the sultana whatever help they need!

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you for coming.

**RAUBAHN:** No thanks are necessary, General. I trust your recuperation continues apace?

**ALPHINAUD:** I cannot complain. Thanks to Higiri and her ministrations, I've regained much of the strength I lost during my imprisonment.

**RAUBAHN:** I gather you have made progress in the search for Her Grace.

**PIPPIN:** Aye, some good fortune at last. A few days past, Dewlala informed us that a sizable shipment of alchemical supplies had been delivered to the palace.

**ALPHINAUD:** With Papashan's assistance, I set out to ascertain the source and nature of the shipment. My inquiries led me to Frondale's Phrontistery. There I learned that an order had been placed for a curious substance designed to sustain patients trapped in deathlike slumber─an invention of the former head alchemist, apparently.

**RAUBAHN:** A deathlike slumber...? This cannot be a coincidence!

**YUGIRI:** It lends some weight to Dewlala's claims, aye. Her Grace is likely somewhere within the palace─abed but alive.

**RAUBAHN:** Before making any attempt to extricate the sultana, however, it seemed prudent to learn what manner of substance was used to induce her torpor. To that end, I made inquiries as to the whereabouts of the one most like to have administered it─the lady-in-waiting, Meriel. We sent for you as soon as we learned of her location. All that remains is to apprehend the woman.

**ALPHINAUD:** We shall find our cat's-paw in the Silver Bazaar. But we must tread carefully. The market is not the bustling place it once was, and someone is sure to mark our coming. Should they inform the Monetarists, we'll have a fight on our hands. We must be prepared for the worst─and being short an arm, I thought it wise to take another in its stead. What say you, Warrior of Light? Will you lend me yours? Then I pity the bastard that stands in our way. Come, my friends! For Nanamo...and for Ul'dah!

**LADYINWAITING2:** You are Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting?

**RAUBAHN:** I know no one of that name! Pray excuse me... General Aldynn!?

**LOLORITO:** We will have the truth from you, girl...

**RAUBAHN:** Mayhap 'twould be better coming from me.

**LOLORITO:** Lolorito... You'd best talk fast.

**RAUBAHN:** As you know, Teledji Adeledji's Carteneau Reclamation Bill was no more than a facade─a means to get his grubby little hands on that Allagan monstrosity, Omega. When he learned of Nanamo's intention to abdicate, however, he was forced to amend his plans. Suddenly, assassination seemed the most promising way to further his ambitions. I am told Teledji had discovered a maid in whose veins ran the blood of House Thorne─a new, more pliable puppet to sit the throne. 'Twould have caused an uproar, of course, but few could have contested her claim. 'Twas plain that Teledji's wild machinations had outgrown our ability to control them. So I decided to usurp his scheme, and left the fool to seal his own demise.

**LOLORITO:** And what of Nanamo?

**RAUBAHN:** Oh, I have no desire to harm Her Grace─'twould profit me little to destabilize our government. Thus did I employ young Meriel here to administer a potent sleeping potion in place of a poison. You should know, General, that your dear friend Ilberd was fully aware of my plan. I had him lie about the assassination as a means to prime your rage against Teledji. We weren't entirely sure how you would react, but things went rather better than expected.

**LOLORITO:** You conniving little worm... You had your claws in the Crystal Braves before their first recruit had sworn to serve!

**RAUBAHN:** But of course. When a new game begins, 'tis only prudent to have a piece on the board. Ilberd was mine. Truth be told, a significant proportion of the Braves' initial endowment was also mine. With such large sums moving about, 'twas a rather trifling matter to disguise my own contribution. Ah, Ilberd... I secured his services with a promise to support his cause once my authority had been solidified. I swear, the man thinks of naught but prising Ala Mhigo from the grasp of the Empire. Unlike you, General, the poor fellow seems quite unable to forsake the land of his forefathers. Mayhap that's why he called you a traitor to your people and a disgrace to your homeland...amongst other things. What was it he always compared you to? Oh, yes! “An overgrown lapdog, begging for scraps at the sultana's table!” Oh, how we laughed... Alas, Ilberd's entertaining little outbursts eventually gave way to wearisome tirades, and the zealous brute became rather unruly. I had no wish to see you executed, you understand, but he would not take no for an answer. Rest assured, his employment with me has long since ended. ...Which brings us neatly to the present. What say you, General? Both you and the sultana are alive; we have one corpse and one fugitive; and preparations have been made to restore your good name. Shall we cry quits and start again with a blank ledger? Hm?

**DEWLALA:** The hells we will! Do you honestly expect me to forgive and forget? After all you've done!? You're guilty of high treason!

**LOLORITO:** Stay your blade, Master Aldynn! You yourself are not innocent! Or have you forgotten your *own* crime in executing Teledji Adeledji without trial!? Though you acted out of loyalty to the sultana, such deeds are in violation of both the word and spirit of the law! ...If you would, Lord Lolorito?

**RAUBAHN:** This potion will wake the sultana from her slumber. Consider it a gesture of conciliation. You will find Her Grace resting comfortably within her private chambers. Should you doubt my word, I shall willingly accompany you to the palace as your hostage.

**DEWLALA:** I like not your motives, Lolorito...but you saved the sultana's life, and for that you have my gratitude.

**NANAMO:** Raubahn Aldynn, you are hereby reinstated as general of the Immortal Flames! The citizens of Ul'dah shall once more be united under Nanamo Ul Namo, and together we shall usher in a new age of prosperity!

**RAUBAHN:** Ugh... I was having the longest dream...

**LOLORITO:** 'Tis time to wake up, Your Grace. Another day begins in Thanalan, and the sun blazes bright upon the sands. Her Grace is awoken. The palace physician assures me she is none the worse for her slumber. I believe Her Grace will soon resume her plans to place the government of Ul'dah into the hands of its citizens. Whatever path she chooses to take, I shall walk it with her. And we shall tread slowly, lest the nation be unsettled in our wake.

**ALPHINAUD:** Her Grace's compassion is a shining beacon to us all...but what our city truly thrives upon is competition. 'Tis in the struggle against our rivals that opportunities are seized and fortunes made. And with the Empire on the offensive once more, now would hardly seem the time to turn our system of government upon its head.

**LOLORITO:** Are you privy to new intelligence, my lord?

**PIPPIN:** I would hardly call it new. Remind me: what was the name of that enormous imperial warship which met its end in Mor Dhona? Wait, I have it! The *Agrius*. Yes, well, 'twould appear that the Garleans have been hard at work on another such vessel.

**LOLORITO:** How close are they to completing this ship!? Is it operational!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Its maiden flight was a success, I hear. I should imagine Emperor Varis is eager to see how it performs in battle. My lords and ladies, I move that it is time to repair the damage caused by Teledji Adeledji, and prepare our great nation to repel the Empire once more.

**ESTINIEN:** 'Tis well that the sultana has awoken. The Syndicate yet needs to put its house in order, but 'twould seem the worst of the confusion has passed. Ul'dah has taken control of its future...and I must do the same. I have decided to disband the Crystal Braves. Among the recruits, there were those who supported our order's goals and convictions with all sincerity. 'Tis my hope that these loyal men and women will choose to remain our allies in the battles to come. As for those who sided with the traitor, Ilberd, they shall be hunted down and held to account for their crimes. It is my earnest hope that they will surrender themselves peaceably when the time comes...though I think it unlikely. Ah, my all-conquering Crystal Braves... The model army meant to pave the way for a single, unified Grand Company of Eorzea. That so high an ideal should be brought so low... I need not tell you how deeply the betrayal stung me. Yet I see now that it was mine own naivety and pride which allowed the Braves to fall prey to corruption. As ever, it is to your own shining example that I turn for inspiration. Like you, I mean to stand firm in the face of hardship, and give mine all for the cause. Let us resume the search for our missing comrades, that we might come together to shine the light of dawn across the realm once more. The role of Crystal Brave commander suited me ill, and I shall play it no longer. Henceforth, I shall be no more or less than Alphinaud, proud member of the Scions.

**AYMERIC:** All stands ready, Lord Commander.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, the moment has come, then?

**ESTINIEN:** Pray excuse my lateness. I paid a brief visit to the workshop to inquire about the manacutters. The engineers assure me that they are ready.

**AYMERIC:** The Aery is now but a short flight away. Yet what a long and winding path we took to reach this point. Were it not for Master Alphinaud's proposal, we never would have attempted to parley with the dragons. Though our negotiations yielded little, our expedition with Lady Iceheart taught us much.

**ESTINIEN:** You took an unimaginable risk... I could scarce believe the tale Estinien told.

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye, 'tis true that many of our countrymen would sooner die than join hands with the heretics' mistress, but 'twas through that most unlikely of alliances that we came to speak with Hraesvelgr.

**ESTINIEN:** A conversation that went rather poorly, as I recall.

**AYMERIC:** In this instance, the journey was more important than the destination. Had we not slain Nidhogg's consort, Tioman, and put the great wyrm on his guard, the Dravanians would have arrived at Ishgard's walls long ago.

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye, that they would. Full grateful am I for every hour of respite your actions have afforded us. Thanks to you, our defenses are much improved. 'Tis but a pity they won't be enough.

**ESTINIEN:** Thus you believe an assault upon the Aery represents the city's best chance of survival. Is that not so, Estinien?

**AYMERIC:** I am under no illusions. Nidhogg's might is legendary. But with his eye in my possession, I can stifle his strength at the source. Victory will be hard-won, even so, and I shall be glad indeed to have the Warrior of Light at my side.

**LUCIA:** You shall have my blade as well. There are more of these “manacutters” to be had, yes?

**AYMERIC:** (-Lucia-)Lord Commander, no!

**ESTINIEN:** How can I, a proud knight of Ishgard, stand by and do naught while an outsider risks life and limb for our homeland? I swore an oath to protect this city!

**AYMERIC:** Pray leave the slaying of dragons to dragoons, ser knight. Your duty to command the city's defense is no less vital. Should we fail, and Nidhogg slip through our grasp, who, then, will hold the walls against him? Will you leave Ishgard in the hands of the Holy See's zealots?

**ESTINIEN:** There are others─

**ALPHINAUD:** Who but you has the authority and the standing to orchestrate a citywide defense? I do not, and neither does the Warrior of Light. That is why it is our place to fight, and yours to remain here, Lord Commander. What, you too, Master Alphinaud? By the Fury... You have shown some promise, but this adversary is far beyond your skills.

**ESTINIEN:** Your candor is appreciated, ser dragoon. I shall remain, then, and cheer you from afar.

**NIDHOGG:** Well, my friend, 'twould seem I have discouraged the last of the volunteers, and claimed the task as ours alone. But if any alive can best this wyrm, 'tis surely we two! We're through! So, this is the Aery! Where are you Nidhogg!? You have guests! There! Greetings, Lord of Dravania! I believe we have something that belongs to you!

**ESTINIEN:** Wicked mortals! I shall melt your flesh, and turn your bones to ash! Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity! I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again!

**SYLVETREL:** No, wyrm! This ends here! You gifted my people a thousand years of suffering. Now I gift you an eternity in darkness!

**HALDRATH:** They are ours, Lord Haldrath... The eyes of Nidhogg!

**SYLVETREL:** Aye... The wyrm lies broken and my father is avenged. With the wellspring of his vitality thus denied him, Nidhogg shall not linger long in this world. But behold the terrible price we have paid. My sire is dead; so many brother knights slain. We traded our honor for the strength which now courses in our veins. And still we are forced to make such sacrifice.

**HALDRATH:** But not in vain, my lord. Hraesvelgr is the only great wyrm left in Dravania, and he dares not leave his lair. With Nidhogg's eyes in your possession, who now can challenge the might of Ishgard? Ascend the throne, and take your rightful place as the ruler of our people!

**SYLVETREL:** Nay, my friend, I must forsake the mantle of king. Though Nidhogg be defeated, his wyrmling horde yet darkens the skies with wings beyond counting. As one who partook of Ratatoskr's strength, it shall be my penance to bear a knight's arms until death grants me leave to retire. When that day comes, no prince shall perish, but a hells-bound hunter of dragons...

**FLAVIEN:** But Lord Haldrath! What then shall become of the royal line!?

**HALDRATH:** Think of your people, my lord! Without a king, who will the common man turn to in his hour of need? How will he find his way without your benevolent hand to guide him?

**SYLVETREL:** I thank you, Ser Flavien and Ser Sylvetrel─for dispelling my remaining doubts. With men of such wisdom and compassion in service to the realm, 'tis plain that Ishgard has no need of a king. But if you must bow to the demands of tradition, you need look no further than yourselves for one worthy to wear the crown. Fare thee well, my brother knights...my loyal friends. On these shoulders shall I bear the weight of my father's sins; with this lance shall I repay the debt accrued through our misdeeds.

**FLAVIEN:** What cruel jest has fate played upon us...? Have we seized this desperate victory only to lose a king?

**BRAWNYKNIGHT:** We can but act as our lord has bid. We few who remain must divide between us the rulership of Ishgard and her people.

**SYLVETREL:** Not I. My oath was to Lord Haldrath, and he alone. If he is not to be king, then I would hang up my shield, as well.

**BRAWNYKNIGHT:** Will you abandon us, too, ser?

**FLAVIEN:** I would wash my hands of blood and betrayal and take up an honest trade. Mayhap I shall serve ale instead of sharpened steel...

**SYLVETREL:** We four, then...

**FLAVIEN:** Fortemps, Haillenarte, Durendaire, and Dzemael... But four houses to rule all of Ishgard...

**SYLVETREL:** ...And what of the throne?

**ESTINIEN:** We keep it empty. Until the day a king rises once more, we must assume the role of stewards. We shall shape our nation anew with a history of our own making─and let the truth of this dark day die here, upon the battlefield.

**HRAESVELGR:** What ails you, friend!? Are you wounded? You have borne witness to history...to the culmination of the first battle with Nidhogg. The legend of Ishgard's founding tells that our ancestors were led to the land of Coerthas by the valiant King Thordan. In the midst of their journey, they came to a wide chasm, where they were set upon by a great wyrm─Nidhogg. A furious battle then ensued, with Thordan leading the van. Though the brave king was slain defending his people, his son, Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon, fought on undaunted... And with a mighty thrust of his lance, he gouged out Nidhogg's eye, forcing the wicked creature into retreat. Thus did this eldritch orb become a sacred treasure of Ishgard, lending its power to every knight deemed worthy to bear the title of Azure Dragoon. A rousing tale, is it not? Would that I could still believe it. But your vision, which we must accept as immutable truth, leaves no room for doubt─save on one point. If Haldrath took both of Nidhogg's eyes, then how came this eye to be lodged in the wyrm's skull? Beneath every answer we unearth, another question lies buried... 'Twas a fierce battle, but one I knew we would win. Your fame is well deserved, Warrior of Light. Full proud am I to have fought at your side. I would fain return with all swiftness to Ishgard to inform the lord commander of our triumph... But we must first have words with Hraesvelgr. There are parts of this tale that the wyrm has kept from us, and I would know wherefore...

**ESTINIEN:** Impenitent mortals, ever seeking to bury old wrongs under new. I did sense the moment of Nidhogg's demise...

**HRAESVELGR:** You mean the moment I prised your eye from his head?

**NIDHOGG:** 'Twould seem thou hast uncovered my secret. Aye. Unto the blinded Nidhogg did I yield one half of my strength... Nidhogg... What hath befallen thee?

**HRAESVELGR:** We are undone by covetous mortals. They did take Ratatoskr's eyes...and glut their appetites upon her essence...

**NIDHOGG:** She is slain, then? What madness hath unmade our peaceful accord!?

**HRAESVELGR:** Did I not warn thee, brood-brother? They have ever been untrustworthy creatures, these short-lived Elezen. But thou wert enchanted by thy mortal maid. Thy folly hath cost Ratatoskr her life, and me mine eyes...

**NIDHOGG:** Oh, my beloved Shiva... How swiftly are thy kin made bestial by their appetites.

**HRAESVELGR:** Hraesvelgr. 'Twas thy blindness that did invite disaster into our lands. Surrender thee an eye to me, and let that be thy penance.

**NIDHOGG:** Nidhogg...

**HRAESVELGR:** They bested me once, but I was reckless. I shall need but a single eye to inflict enduring torment upon these traitors and every child of their line! Yield to me thy strength, brood-brother! My vengeance is begun!

**ICEHEART:** Thou hast borne witness to a scene from my past.

**ESTINIEN:** It was yours... Your strength that sustained Nidhogg all these years...

**HRAESVELGR:** Would that Haldrath had dealt the wyrm a killing blow...

**ICEHEART:** When my brood-brother did appear before me, bloody and blinded, his life was all but spent. He demanded half my vigor, that he might exact his revenge upon the mortals who had wronged us.

**HRAESVELGR:** And so you acquiesced! You surrendered your eye to Nidhogg knowing full well the suffering he would inflict!

**ESTINIEN:** The peace my beloved so dearly desired had been shattered by her own kin. Their treachery claimed my brood-sister's life and my brood-brother's reason! Thinkest thou thy fits of indignation will move me to remorse!? Go, mortals! Take your unruly passions and leave this place... Your presence here spelleth naught but misery. Were it not for Shiva's soothing embrace, I would slay you where you stand. Woe betide you should the bond we share ever weaken!

**ICEHEART:** 'Twas my life's goal to slay Nidhogg, but I find there is little joy to be had in its accomplishment.

**ESTINIEN:** But you have rid the world of a hate-filled creature, and ended a bloody war in so doing...

**ICEHEART:** I lost my family to Nidhogg's flames. And 'twas with fury in my heart that I took up the lance. Every blow I struck, I struck in the name of vengeance. We were not so different, he and I.

**ESTINIEN:** I will not judge you for your deeds─I have not the right. Too many innocents have perished in the name of my “greater good.”

**ICEHEART:** Yet even with all that has passed, the tale is incomplete. We are short a great wyrm's eye. Of the pair which Haldrath took from Nidhogg, only one is known to us─the one I bear. What, then, became of the other? Why did Nidhogg, who had taken such pains to prolong the Dragonsong War, suddenly decide to hurl his entire army against the walls of Ishgard? Lord Commander... Aye, the deed is done. Nidhogg is slain. What? ...In the city!? A battle with whom!? At once, Lord Commander. Hold firm till our return. Fighting has broken out in the city. Lord Aymeric was sparse with the particulars, but it seems some commoners threw open the gates to a force of heretics.

**ESTINIEN:** I gave no order to attack!

**ICEHEART:** Are we to mark the end of the Dragonsong War by spilling the blood of our own? Mayhap Hraesvelgr was right about us... Let us away, Warrior of Light. The people must be saved from themselves.

**ESTINIEN:** Wait! I would join you! There has been enough violence. I will appeal to my people in the city and make them see reason!

**ZEPHIRIN:** Come, then, Lady Iceheart. Let us write the final chapter in this damnable war.

**THORDAN:** A small army of heretics has invaded the city, Your Eminence. But there is no cause for concern. A sizable contingent of our soldiers is already in place to repel the Dravanian assault, and the intruders will soon find themselves outnumbered and outmatched.

**ZEPHIRIN:** Our plans proceed apace, then.

**THORDAN:** Yes, Your Eminence. This unrest shall serve to feed the people's fear of the heretics and the dragons both.

**ZEPHIRIN:** And lend renewed fervor to their prayers for deliverance... Very good. Grant our guests what time they need to sow a measure of chaos, then order the Temple Knights to crush them.

**LAHABREA:** Your will be done.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ICEHEART:** There!

**MALEHERETIC:** Comrades! Sheathe your swords! There is no need for further bloodshed!

**FEMALEHERETIC:** My lady!?

**ICEHEART:** She is come!

**MALEHERETIC:** Hear me, brothers and sisters! The war is ended! Nidhogg is no more! Aye, it is so! This adventurer and the Azure Dragoon laid the great wyrm low! The endless cycle of violence between man and dragon was born of our forefathers' treachery. You have followed me─bled with me─to bring this truth to light, that we might all know peace! But Nidhogg is dead─Nidhogg is dead, my friends! He who bore such hatred towards Ishgard is dead! Let his hatred die with him, I say! Let us sheathe our swords and go in peace!

**ICEHEART:** Have we lost!?

**FEMALEHERETIC:** No, my friend, far from it! At long last, the peace for which we have so desperately fought is within our grasp! And I for one would not forsake it!

**TEMPLEKNIGHT2:** Peace...?

**HAURCHEFANT:** Seize the witch! Let none escape!

**EDMONT:** Providing aid and succor to the wounded should be our first concern. If the heretics mean to observe the peace, then it would be folly not to do the same!

**HAURCHEFANT:** Praise Halone, you are safe!

**EDMONT:** My safety was never in doubt, Father, for I had the Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light by my side. We bring the most wonderful tidings!

**AYMERIC:** The infamous Lady Iceheart, here in Ishgard? This is most unexpected...

**EDMONT:** She has done much to quell the violence. The inquisition may not approve, but we are glad of her presence.

**AYMERIC:** And with the great wyrm's demise, even our nation's more reactionary elements will have scant grounds to press for her immediate impeachment.

**ALPHINAUD:** My thoughts exactly.

**AYMERIC:** What of the truth revealed to us by Hraesvelgr? That the origins of the Dragonsong War─a core tenet of Ishgardian faith─are quite unlike those depicted in the scriptures.

**EDMONT:** ...That men and dragons once lived together in harmony, and that it was man's treachery which shattered the peace and plunged our peoples into war.

**ALPHINAUD:** The same scripture also describes the origins of the High Houses. Were it exposed as false, the legitimacy of our rule would be called into question. If both highborn and lowborn can trace their ancestry to Thordan and his knights twelve...

**AYMERIC:** But a single sip of dragon's blood is required to confirm their lineage.

**EDMONT:** If the Holy See knew of this and chose to remain silent, their crimes are grievous indeed. Regardless, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Ser Aymeric! You cannot mean to raise this matter with the archbishop!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Pray consider what you are proposing! If the Holy See chose to conceal the truth for centuries, what reason would they have to reveal it now!?

**AYMERIC:** At best, you will be branded a heretic and clapped in irons!

**LUCIA:** Then, at least, the archbishop will have shown his true colors. My friends, this war will never truly be at an end until the truth is made known. You must see what lies on the horizon if it is not. When ruled by fear of a common enemy, we were united. But now we have none. During the war, the highborn needed men to lead, and the lowborn, men to follow. Not anymore. 'Tis but a matter of time before the old order is called into question. Lady Iceheart will share the truth with her followers, and the Holy See will be powerless to stop its spread. The disenfranchised will rise up, united, and blood will flow in the streets once more... A divided Ishgard will not survive.

**ALPHINAUD:** Tread carefully, Lord Commander...

**LUCIA:** My lady, is it wise to let him go? I sympathize with the lord commander's desire for reform, but to approach the archbishop in this manner bespeaks an idealism to which I did not think Ser Aymeric prone.

**ALPHINAUD:** Though he comports himself as a realist, he has long dreamt of reform. 'Twas that idealism which first drew me to him─that which made me swear an oath to serve. We must not think of ways to hinder his cause, but rather ways to aid it─even should the Holy See cry heresy.

**LUCIA:** You cannot mean...

**EDMONT:** If the lord commander does not return from the Vault at the appointed hour, I mean to go and fetch him.

**LUCIA:** Have care, my lady─your words border on treason! Should they reach the wrong ears, you would be declared an enemy of Ishgard!

**ESTINIEN:** That is a risk I am willing to take. Lest you forget, my lord─I am not born of this land. My loyalty is to the lord commander alone. But I speak only of what may come to pass. If the rumors regarding his heritage are to be believed, we have naught to fear.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hmph. Lies and slander.

**LUCIA:** Forgive me─what rumors are these?

**ALPHINAUD:** That Ser Aymeric is the archbishop's bastard son. Senior clergy are not permitted to marry and sire children. But even the holiest among us are not immune to temptation.

**LUCIA:** I labor to believe it... Ser Aymeric is truly the archbishop's son?

**ESTINIEN:** He has never been publicly acknowledged as such, but the rumors have plagued him since childhood. That he rose to his current position, despite being despised as a bastard, and accused of profiting from his father's influence, bespeaks the quality of his character. It is my hope that on this occasion, the burden of his birth will work in his favor. Should our worst fears be realized, the archbishop will not be so quick to execute his own flesh and blood, affording us time to mount a rescue.

**HAURCHEFANT:** Bastard or trueborn, he is our nation's best hope. If the Holy See dares to threaten him, I shall lead the charge against the Vault myself.

**EDMONT:** Hear, hear! The future of Ishgard rests on Ser Aymeric's shoulders! I too will do mine utmost to aid his cause!

**HAURCHEFANT:** Haurchefant, be reasonable...

**EDMONT:** A knight lives to serve, Father─to aid those in need! The people need Ser Aymeric─more than ever─and we may be his only hope! There is no greater calling for a knight than to save the life of his fellow man. I swear to you, on the sigil of our house, that I shall do this and make you proud.

**LUCIA:** Even you? <sigh> Romantic, reckless fools, the lot of you. So be it─make your preparations.

**REVOLUTIONARY1:** I thank you all for your support.

**TATARU:** Where d'you think you're goin', missy?

**ALPHINAUD:** I-I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend!

**REVOLUTIONARY1:** What's going on here!?

**REVOLUTIONARY2:** What's it to you, boy!? Piss off!

**REVOLUTIONARY1:** Hold on! I've seen them around. They're in and out of House Fortemps's manor all the time.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ohhh, I see. Skulkin' about at your highborn masters' biddin', eh? Bloodhounds hopin' to catch a whiff of heresy, is that it?

**REVOLUTIONARY1:** You are quite mistaken, I assure you. We came here to help. And if you know what's good for you, you will let us pass!

**HILDA:** Haha! Listen to the pup's yappin'! Come here, boy─I'll give you cause to yelp!

**REVOLUTIONARY2:** (-???-)Enough! Leave threatenin' women and children to our “betters”! We don't have the knack! 

**HILDA:** Hilda!?

**REVOLUTIONARY1:** Lay a finger on the blue bloods' pups and you're like to lose the hand. It ain't often I get called on by *glorious* heroes like yourself. So tell me: what have I done to deserve you? ...So while you were on your way to kill Nidhogg, you stumbled on some dirty secrets that the Holy See has been hidin' for centuries.

**HILDA:** Eh? What are they on about?

**REVOLUTIONARY2:** The High Houses, and what makes a nobleman so bleedin' noble. They trace their blood back to King Thordan and his knights twelve─the founders of Ishgard. But our friends here reckon we're *all* descended from the heroes of eld─highborn and lowborn alike. And so Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights, has gone to ask the archbishop if he wouldn't mind lettin' everyone know.

**HILDA:** Is he simple!? The old bastard'll have him executed for heresy!

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, seems to me that's what the good ser wants. Seems he thinks a noble sacrifice will serve to prove his claims.

**HILDA:** We cannot stand idly by and allow Ser Aymeric to do this. Ishgard has need of him.

**ALPHINAUD:** Look, you've a good heart. I can see that. Willin' to risk your neck for someone else, even when his troubles ain't yours. But what's this got to do with me?

**HILDA:** If Ser Aymeric is imprisoned in the Vault, we will need all the help we can muster to breach their defenses and rescue him.

**CHARIBERT:** What in the hells─!?

**HILDA:** <sniff> Ahhh, the unmistakable scent of heresy... And what do we have here? The honored guests of House Fortemps consorting with the queen of rats? Oooh. Plotting insurrection I shouldn't wonder! Tsk-tsk. That won't do. Sickness is wont to fester and spread. It must be burned out ere the infection takes hold.

**CHARIBERT:** I reckon ser'd be happy to wield the irons himself. Well, so happens I've got irons of my own.

**LUCIA:** Ahahaha! Such simple creatures, rats. *Certain* to attack when cornered. Let us step outside, milady. In here, your toys could hurt someone. There's no denying your gifts... A well-deserved reputation indeed.

**CHARIBERT:** Enough!

**HILDA:** Hmph.

**ALPHINAUD:** Gah! Lucky bastard.

**LUCIA:** Nay...'tis we who are lucky. Had we fought on, 'twas but a matter of time before our conflict claimed the life of an innocent bystander.

**HAURCHEFANT:** I thought the Heavens' Ward might come here as well.

**LUCIA:** They came to the Temple Knights' headquarters?

**HAURCHEFANT:** Aye. Ser Grinnaux announced that the lord commander had been imprisoned under suspicion of heresy, and that the Heavens' Ward had been granted full authority in his stead.

**LUCIA:** Then the Heavens' Ward now commands the Temple Knights...

**HILDA:** Those still loyal to Ser Aymeric answer to me. Alas, that amounts to but half our number. The other half, who opposed his promotion to lord commander, have gathered at the Vault as ordered.

**LUCIA:** Bolsterin' the guard already, eh? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're expected.

**HILDA:** I take it you're in charge around here?

**CHARIBERT:** Hilda, and yes. The young master was just persuadin' me to join his lost cause. Convincin' little beggar, isn't he? Aye, your passion moved me─a bit. That, and the fact that we're sick of livin' off the leavin's of our “betters.” If you've a mind to change things around here, then we've a mind to join you!

**ZEPHIRIN:** Our power... How can this be!?

**AYMERIC:** Fall back!

**ESTINIEN:** Father, please!

**AYMERIC:** For a mercy, we were not too late.

**THORDAN:** Why must you do this, Father!? Nidhogg is fallen! There is no need for further deception! Now is the time to renounce the lies which led us down this path─to start anew!

**HAURCHEFANT:** And tear down the very pillars of our society─our history, our values─everything we have built over a thousand years? <sigh> A fool to the last.

**THORDAN:** Look out!

**AYMERIC:** Go. Azys Lla awaits.

**ALPHINAUD:** Lord Haurchefant!

**HAURCHEFANT:** It's no good... The wound is too deep. It refuses to mend...

**EDMONT:** You...you are unharmed? F-Forgive me... I could not bear the thought of...of... Oh, do not look at me so. A smile better suits a hero...

**ALPHINAUD:** Don't. Please. A knight lives to serve. To protect. To sacrifice. There is no greater calling. Leave me to mourn, and give chase. For my son, and for the nation he loved. Go.

**EDMONT:** ...His sacrifice shall not be forgotten.

**AYMERIC:** My son...

**ALPHINAUD:** My friends. I am in your debt.

**AYMERIC:** Think nothing of it. Your wounds are healing well, I trust?

**THORDAN:** Some wounds do not heal... The founding, the scriptures─a thousand years of lies─all to deceive the common man! Nay, our own brothers and sisters─for the blood of the knights twelve flows within *all* our veins! You knew this to be true. You knew and you concealed it!

**AYMERIC:** I should be interested to hear how you came by this knowledge. But yes, you have the right of it. The architects of Ishgard, King Thordan and his knights twelve, entrapped and butchered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, that they might partake of her eyes, and thereby transcend their mortal limits. Upon learning of their treachery, Nidhogg was consumed with a murderous─and justified─rage. I daresay you know what followed...

**THORDAN:** The great wyrm slew the king and half of his knights.

**AYMERIC:** Aye...but Nidhogg was subdued, and his eyes plucked from their sockets by the knights that remained. Their one mistake was to show mercy, for from his brother Hraesvelgr did Nidhogg receive a new eye, thus rejuvenating his form and empowering him to embark upon an eternal quest for vengeance.

**THORDAN:** ...Whilst Thordan's son Haldrath took one of Nidhogg's eyes and learned to wield its power in defense of his people...

**AYMERIC:** Thus was the first Azure Dragoon born. And ever since that time, his honored successors have risen to drive Nidhogg from our lands whenever the wyrm has returned to plague us. I ask you, my son: will you answer for my sins? Will your son and his son answer for me as well?

**THORDAN:** What do you mean?

**AYMERIC:** If a man cannot atone for his sins in the course of his all-too-fleeting life, must his progeny then be held to account? Must every subsequent generation be judged as well? Thordan's betrayal of Ratatoskr was an unconscionable, unforgivable sin. Should we, then, as his descendants, meekly surrender ourselves to an eternity of punishment? Nay, say I. I would not see our children sacrificed in a vain attempt to appease an implacable foe. Dragons are not like us, my son. To they who live forever, the wrongs of antiquity are as those of yesterday. No reparations shall ever suffice. This fact alone should serve as ample justification for our actions, yet some refuse to see it as such. For men like you, who yearn to commit themselves to a nobler cause, a more compelling narrative is required.

**THORDAN:** This is your solution!? This is how you protect our people? You have given us a *lost* cause! A death sentence! With your compelling narrative, you but doom our countrymen to give their lives for a lie!

**AYMERIC:** And they do so gladly. Highborn and lowborn alike are proud to serve─to fight and die for their country. And what would you say to them? What would you tell the wives who have lost their husbands, the mothers who have lost their sons? ...That their loved ones died for naught?

**THORDAN:** I...

**ZEPHIRIN:** Over the course of a thousand years, countless men have donned these robes, and every one of them came to accept the necessity of this solution. Once, I hoped you might come to accept it as well. Do not despair, my son. Soon I shall free us from the sins of antiquity... ...And bring about the change you so fervently desire. If he has spoken with others, I would have their names. Escort him to a cell and question him─thoroughly.

**ALPHINAUD:** Your Eminence.

**AYMERIC:** You saw something, did you not? A vision of the past?

**ALPHINAUD:** So this is the power of the Echo. Would that it had shown you a finer moment from my past. 'Twas an exercise in futility, as you saw. Faced with the firmity of his conviction, and his many ready rejoinders, my words deserted me. To be frank, I am embarrassed to recall it.

**AYMERIC:** A friend once impressed upon me the importance of differentiating between words, deeds, and beliefs. Were he here, I suspect he would judge your father's “conviction” to be no more than rank, self-serving delusion. Even so, I cannot help but wonder what manner of “change” he intends to bring about.

**LUCIA:** I have given some thought to that as well. During the battle within the Vault, the Heavens' Ward demonstrated strange and unnatural abilities.

**AYMERIC:** Aye, the manner in which Ser Zephirin struck down Lord Haurchefant was unlike anything I've ever seen before.

**ALPHINAUD:** The spectacle called to mind King Thordan and his knights twelve as they are depicted in scripture─holy powers and all...

**AYMERIC:** Mere fabrications...which have become objects of faith...instilled with the belief of countless devoted souls... Seven hells!

**LUCIA:** If Lady Iceheart can use her own body as a vessel for summoning, I see no reason why others could not...

**ALPHINAUD:** Are the Heavens' Ward truly so reckless?

**AYMERIC:** Unbelievable.

**HAURCHEFANT:** As they fled, my father spoke of Azys Lla. Though I know not what he intends, I fear no good shall come of it. His ambitions are too great, and his minions too powerful... We must find the Heavens' Ward, and stop my father, before it is too late.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**HYDAELYN:** To the northern reaches of the Sea of Clouds,
where countless isles yet remained uncharted... In search of a mysterious land known as Azys Lla,
and the unmasked villain who sought to claim its secrets... Oblivious to the new threat which followed in their wake, they came...

**IGEYOHRM:** Warrior...Light. Beloved... ...Hydaelyn. All made... Darkness...like to none...known... Hark...receive...blessing...more...

**THORDAN:** So falls the Lord of Mists, as did all others before him. How many times does this make, Warrior of Light? Ahhh, how much you have grown─far beyond the limits of mere mortals.

**IGEYOHRM:** She has what we seek?

**THORDAN:** That she does. The key to Azys Lla and the secrets of Allag. I see you have regained the blessing of Light─albeit at a fraction of its former strength.

**ALPHINAUD:** My thanks to you, Ascian─and to you as well, Warrior of Light, for saving us the effort of slaying Bismarck. Now that the key is within our grasp, the path to the heavens shall at last be laid bare! Hahaha... Ahahahahaha! By our deeds shall the wrongs of antiquity be righted, and man reclaim the reins of history!

**REGULA:** Wait. Something is amiss... Imperial troops─and they have already secured the area.

**VARIS:** Reveal yourselves at once! And there I was expecting more beastmen. Who are you!?

**REGULA:** I thought Ishgardians responsible for the disappearance of our scouts, but I see now that I was mistaken. Just as Roaille observed. The Warrior of Light is wont to appear at the most inopportune times.

**VARIS:** The Warrior of Light? She who bested van Baelsar!?

**ALPHINAUD:** It would seem that the famous hero of Eorzea seeks Azys Lla as well. Hardly unexpected. The secrets of the Allagans' power to bind eikons to their will could scarcely fail to interest the Scions of the Seventh Dawn... You know as well as we what will ensue should these insatiable creatures be allowed to roam free─that their very existence threatens the life of this star. We but disagree on the solution to the problem.

**VARIS:** Genocide has ever been the Empire's favored recourse─and that is why we will continue to oppose your every attempt to claim Eorzea!

**ALPHINAUD:** You do not hesitate to speak your mind...even when your every word could be your last. Alas, your sentiments betray the narrowness of your view. The fate of Eorzea and its inhabitants is of little concern next to the fate of the world. 'Tis my solemn charge as emperor to bring the eikons to heel. If this requires the extermination of certain elements, then so be it.

**REGULA:** No, don't! They are not his thralls!

**LUCIA:** Where did that come from!?

**REGULA:** Take cover!

**VARIS:** Your Radiance, we must withdraw!

**ALPHINAUD:** We shall meet again, Warrior of Light. On that you have my word.

**LUCIA:** So Garlemald, too, has designs on Azys Lla... But why would the Emperor himself elect to lead the expedition?

**CID:** I did not think that I would ever have occasion to pilot a suit of magitek armor again─least of all under these circumstances. My full name is Lucia goe Junius, and I was born a citizen of Garlemald.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, that explains it! When we first met in Ishgard, I very nearly called you Livia.

**LUCIA:** Livia...? Livia sas Junius? The tribunus who served under Gaius van Baelsar!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye, she was my sister─though we spent little time together. After our parents were killed in an uprising, we were sent to live in different households, setting us on separate paths... Livia felt at home on the battlefield and chose to become a soldier, while I underwent training to become a spy.

**LUCIA:** Then...Ishgard was...?

**ALPHINAUD:** My mission. 'Twas believed that Allagan relics of great worth were stored in the Vault, and I was sent to investigate. Though I was given little information at the time, I now suspect I was searching for the key we but recently lost. And then I met Ser Aymeric. 'Twas his usefulness to my mission which prompted me to approach him, but I soon found myself drawn to him for other reasons. He too was a prisoner of his past─judged for his heritage as a bastard son of the archbishop. Yet unlike my sister and I, he did not curse his fate. He simply rose above it. In time, I came to realize that I had found a man worth following, and a new home besides. And when I subsequently confessed all to Ser Aymeric, he was good enough to accept me into his service.

**LUCIA:** ...I do not question your loyalty to Ser Aymeric. 'Tis your loyalty to your sister which concerns me.

**CID:** I have long been of the opinion that those who dwell in the past risk losing sight of their future. My sister fought for her convictions, and for those she held dear. So do I. So must we all.

**BIGGS:** Well, I for one am happy to welcome a fellow Garlean to our merry band─especially one who can make magitek armor sing!

**WEDGE:** Chief, we should be getting close.

**CID:** Once we break through those clouds, we'll be right where the light was pointing─right where Azys Lla should be!

**BIGGS:** Hold on, everyone! Look! I think that's it!

**CID:** Chief, is that...?

**ALPHINAUD:** Allagan, aye. There's no mistaking their handiwork.

**CID:** What was that!?

**WEDGE:** Some sort of barrier!?

**BIGGS:** She won't hold, Chief! She's breaking up!

**ALPHINAUD:** I've lost the auxiliary propeller!

**CID:** Cid, it's no use! We must return to Ishgard and find another way!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**AYMERIC:** ...In summary, the isle owes its lofty position to the industry of the Allagans. And we can be all but certain that the archbishop and his cronies are enjoying the view from its top.

**CID:** I see.

**ALPHINAUD:** If we are to join them, we will first need to pass through the isle's aetheric barrier─which is, alas, more powerful than most. Powerful enough to make a mess of a perfectly good airship, at any rate... As far as I can gather, the barrier mechanism draws aether from the surrounding environment, and polarizes its elemental aspect to produce what is, in effect, a wall of lightning.

**CID:** It seems plain that without the Vanu's key, any attempt to reach the isle will end in failure.

**AYMERIC:** Alas, the key was careless enough to leave without us, and I don't think the Vanu keep a spare.

**CID:** Master Garlond─based on your experience, is there no other way that we might breach the barrier?

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, in the past, we've beaten similar barriers by nullifying them with elemental converters. But the one we're up against this time dwarfs aught we've encountered before. The *Enterprise* simply isn't large enough to bear the requisite amount of crystals.

**CID:** I am reminded of the quantity needed to nullify Leviathan's command of the sea... A veritable mountain of crystals that could only be borne by lashing two galleons together to form a “twin vessel” scarcely able to propel itself, much less fly.

**AYMERIC:** That said, we're not without options. If it isn't feasible to nullify the barrier, we might try *piercing* it.

**CID:** How?

**ALPHINAUD:** We create a ram of condensed aether and mount it on my ship. There's just one problem─I don't have the faintest idea how to build one. It's going to take a true authority in the field, I reckon.

**EDMONT:** Would that the Archons were still with us...

**ALPHINAUD:** But yesterday evening, I chanced to find Mistress Tataru in unusually high spirits. Assuming I understood her excited ramblings correctly, she has acquired a clue pointing to the whereabouts of one such individual.

**CID:** An Archon!? Truly!?

**KANESENNA:** Hah, fortune favors the righteous, eh? Well then, let's not waste any time. While you go and look for our missing friend, I'll work on modifying the *Enterprise*. Her hull will need reinforcing to bear the punishment, not to mention a mount for the ram. Just you wait, my pretty─by the time I'm finished, you'll be an airship reborn!

**ALPHINAUD:** In requesting the elementals' assistance to find Y'shtola, you must needs be aware of one difficulty─a difficulty born of the fundamental difference between man and elemental.

**KANESENNA:** That being...?

**TATARU:** In perceiving the world around him, man relies upon senses such as sight and sound. For the sake of convenience, he gives names to such things as are near or dear to him. Being formed of pure aether, however, such concepts are foreign to the elementals. Instead, they perceive by observing the ebb and flow of the energies of life. So profound a division cannot be bridged with simple discourse. The elementals' voices stir not the air, and thus reach not our ears, while our words are but wind to them. Though we seers can commune with them through feelings, naught that we can impart will serve to aid them in identifying Y'shtola. Nay, they must needs be presented with aether which is akin to hers. If you could but find a family member...

**KANESENNA:** Oh, I know just the person! Y'shtola has a sister who came to live in Gridania. She told me about her once.

**TATARU:** That is most fortunate indeed! Pray seek this sister out, then, and bring her to Everschade. There, we shall petition the great ones' aid in finding your lost companion. Let us begin. Raya-O, A-Ruhn─if you would. Hearken to me, O great ones. Pray give yourselves to the Lifestream, a drifting soul to find.

**KANESENNA:** Please, Y'shtola... Please come back to us...

**TATARU:** There! Now! A room has been readied at the Roost. Pray bear her thither at once. All that remains is to pray, my friends.

**YSHTOLA:** Y'shtola! I'm so glad you're back!

**TATARU:** Tataru...

**YSHTOLA:** Weahhh! Weahhh!

**ALPHINAUD:** You are safe... Thank the Twelve. Something has changed about you, Alphinaud. Or mayhap the change is with me? I seem to sense the aether around me more keenly than before.

**YSHTOLA:** I am pleased to see you well again. Do you feel strong enough to talk?

**ALPHINAUD:** Worry not. I am well enough.

**YSHTOLA:** Tell us, then─what befell you after you fled the feast? We were told that there had been a tunnel collapse.

**ALPHINAUD:** That was my doing. I brought the tunnel down that you and Minfilia might escape. At the last moment, I invoked a teleportation magick in hopes of spiriting Thancred away, at least. Needless to say, it did not go quite as planned, and I found myself adrift in the Lifestream. The others─where are they? Did they not escape?

**YSHTOLA:** They remain unaccounted for. You are the only one we have been able to find. I am truly sorry. It was the Crystal Braves who pursued you that day─my hubris that led to our undoing.

**TATARU:** No apologies are necessary, Alphinaud─you are not to blame for what occurred. Know that were our comrades here, they would commend you for keeping the light of hope alive.

**ALPHINAUD:** Don't...don't worry! The others are alive and well, I'm sure of it! We just need to find them!

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed, Tataru. Let us find our friends and rebuild the Scions.

**TATARU:** Ha! There is the Alphinaud I remember─and I feel much the better for his return! 'Tis time I arose!

**YSHTOLA:** That reminds me! I have a change of clothes for you! I don't like to boast, but I made them myself. I learned how to weave while we were in Ishgard, you see.

**ALPHINAUD:** Tataru has apprised me of all that took place in the aftermath of the assassination plot. It would seem I have been away for some while.

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, much and more happened during your absence. At present, we seek to follow the archbishop to Azys Lla.

**ALPHINAUD:** And you want for some manner of aetheric ram to pierce the floating isle's protective barrier.

**YSHTOLA:** We do. Might you be able to furnish us with one?

**EDMONT:** A means to prise open a hole in an Allagan barrier─and one large enough to admit an airship, no less... Hm... Nay. I lack the knowledge to devise such a weapon. ...But I know of one who could. A leading figure in the field of aetheric research, and one of the finest scholars ever to grace Sharlayan─Matoya, my former master.

**MATOYA:** To the Thaliak River, whereto the melted snows of Abalathia's Spine
eventually find their way by means of a thousand silver streams... Whose waters have long nourished the Dravanian hinterlands, and so provided
for a settlement of learned souls from across the northern seas... To the city of Sharlayan, that great seat of knowledge,
now abandoned by her keepers, they came.

**YSHTOLA:** Don't you know it's rude to enter without knocking? Hmph, the youth of today─no manners at all...

**MATOYA:** Though we neglected to knock, we *did* create something of a commotion. I had hoped that would suffice.

**YSHTOLA:** Heavy-handed as ever, I see. And still not a hint of grace. Some things never change.

**MATOYA:** To give credit where credit is due─I learned from the best. It has been too long, Master Matoya.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed it has. It's good to see you again, my girl, and with your fiery spirit unquenched. But look at you─all grown up and womanly. ...The one there in the fancy duds─that's Louisoix's granddaughter, I take it?

**MATOYA:** Ahem. Grandson, begging your pardons. You knew my grandfather, my lady?

**ALPHINAUD:** ...Knew him? We were constantly at each other's throats! Like rabid dogs, we were! He was a stubborn bugger, was your grandfather. Never a dull moment when he was around, though, I'll give him that. As for you, boy, I've known you since you were a rosy-cheeked babe at the teat.

**MATOYA:** And my sister, too, I gather. May I say what an honor it is to meet you again, my lady.

**YSHTOLA:** Spare me the hollow pleasantries, boy. I'll wager my remaining good teeth you didn't come to a forgotten corner of Eorzea to flirt with a wrinkly old woman. Now, out with it─what is it you need of me? Azys Lla... I never thought I'd hear that name again...

**MATOYA:** You are familiar with it?

**ALPHINAUD:** As familiar as one can get from poring over musty old tomes. The Allagans set the isle afloat not long before the sun set on their empire. Old Louisoix and I often talked about it. The place is home to a research facility dedicated to finding ways of mastering mighty beings such as primals and dragons. And find ways it did, too─*frightening* ones. Such secrets as lie buried on Azys Lla aren't fit to see the light of day. And now you tell me a band of dragon-baiting primal-botherers are trying to dig them up!?

**MATOYA:** Indeed. And to make matters worse, the Ascians have a hand in their plot. They must be stopped, no matter the cost.

**YSHTOLA:** I see. Very well.

**MATOYA:** You will help us, then? Truly? I had not anticipated such an impassioned response. Could it be that the presence of young blood has stirred your own?

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, some things never change... One day, that pertness is going to cost you your tail, my girl. Don't say I didn't warn you. 'Twas some fifty years ago, shortly after Garlemald had brought all of Ilsabard under its rule. Faced with the threat of invasion, the people of Sharlayan scrambled about for a means to resist the Empire. For my part, I was tasked with developing an aetheric converger.

**MATOYA:** Ah, yes, a device which draws in aether and concentrates it to produce a destructive force.

**YSHTOLA:** But as my research neared its end, it was denounced by the Forum, who claimed that my device was more likely to destroy us than our enemies. After that, they and I had a little falling-out, and I decided to seal away all the fruits of my research, lest the dunderheaded ingrates reap any benefit. Petty, I know, but gods, it was satisfying!

**MATOYA:** Do mine ears deceive? 'Twas you, was it not, who was so fond of saying that all knowledge exists to advance mankind? That how it is used depends on us?

**ALPHINAUD:** I don't remember. Perhaps. All right, yes, that was a pet phrase of mine. And that should give you a notion of how sick and tired I was of those spineless wretches of the Forum. All talk and no trousers, that lot. That's why I decided to remain behind rather than join the exodus.

**YSHTOLA:** You may have had your disagreements with my grandfather, but upon that point, your minds were as one.

**MATOYA:** With respect, Master─the fruits of your research should not be left to spoil. Will you share with us the secrets of the aetheric converger?

**YSHTOLA:** Aye, I will. All the information you need is contained in a tome I wrote on the subject. But you'll have to fetch it from the forbidden section of the Great Library.

**MATOYA:** You were not exaggerating when you said that you had sealed it away. Though the city is abandoned, the library's guardians are all but certain to remain. We must needs cut a path through them. Come─let us away.

**ALPHINAUD:** Not so fast! You don't expect that you can just waltz on in, now, do you?

**MATOYA:** So this is the tome. Excellent. Let us take it to Master Matoya at once.

**ALPHINAUD:** I had not thought to behold this tome again... There. It is deciphered. Now your friend should be able to make sense of the contents. That said, it's one thing to understand the workings of the aetheric converger, and another to actually make it work. You do realize how much aether is required?

**YSHTOLA:** Cid is keenly aware of the energy dilemma. His airship is by no means large, and it can only bear a limited quantity of crystals.

**ALPHINAUD:** If only we had white auracite and the aetheric siphon...

**YSHTOLA:** Alas, Minfilia is missing, along with both artifacts. And Moenbryda is gone...

**ALPHINAUD:** Would that there were another ready wellspring of energy for us to draw upon...

**MATOYA:** Why did it not occur to us before? We already have what we need: the Eye! It has been drawing aether into itself for as long as the great wyrms have lived! It is a veritable wellspring of energy!

**ALPHINAUD:** Hm, it might just suit our needs. But is this energy something that can be harnessed at will?

**YSHTOLA:** I believe so─with the aid of the Azure Dragoon of Ishgard.

**MATOYA:** Then it is settled. Let us return to the Holy See at once.

**YSHTOLA:** Shtola, wait. When did the light fade from your eyes?

**MATOYA:** I might have known that it would not escape your notice. It has been this way since I returned from the Lifestream. An aftereffect of the teleportation magick I invoked, most like.

**YSHTOLA:** They are called “forbidden spells” for a reason. What were you thinking, girl?

**MATOYA:** I have no regrets. I but did what was necessary to preserve the light of hope─to keep my promise to Minfilia. Besides, it afforded me the rare opportunity to wander the aether─a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

**YSHTOLA:** I need not tell you that it consumes your very life force to see by sensing the aether around you. Take care of yourself, do you hear me?

**ESTINIEN:** I will, Master Matoya. And thank you. Until but recently, the Ishgardians had kept their doors firmly shut to outsiders. But thanks to you, we have found in them stout allies, with whom we may fight to secure the future of the realm. Truly, you are the beacon of hope towards which all men are drawn.

**YSHTOLA:** Spare us the hyperbole. 'Tis not for praise that we fight.

**ESTINIEN:** Oh? In light of all we have achieved, I felt it only meet to express my gratitude.

**YSHTOLA:** All that we have achieved? Hmph. Spoken like a true outsider. Until the war is over, we have achieved nothing. The coming battle is a chance to excise the root of this conflict, and by my hand, it shall be done. *Then* you may speak of achievement.

**ESTINIEN:** 'Twas not mine intent to make light of your struggle. If I have given offense, then I apologize. But if I may speak freely, you would do well to be wary of the Eye. Even now, it burns with insatiable hatred, watching unblinking for a sign of weakness. Should you falter for so much as a moment, it will surely consume you.

**URIANGER:** Save your concern. I will consume the Eye ere I let it consume me.

**YSHTOLA:** Twelve be praised, thou hast not yet set forth! 'Cross sand and snow have I journeyed, that I might deliver this gift unto thee.

**URIANGER:** White auracite... But whence did it come?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**WEDGE:** Ah, excellent timing! We've just finished our work on the *Enterprise*. She's so much improved, I've decided to give her a new name to suit: The *Enterprise Excelsior*! Or simply the *Excelsior*, if pressed for time. Once again, she'll carry Eorzea's protectors into battle!

**EDMONT:** All aboard!

**AYMERIC:** I can do no more than see you off with prayers for your safety and success. Yet know that wheresoever you may go, my son's spirit goes with you. May the Fury grant you strength!

**CID:** Return to us─all of you!

**ESTINIEN:** *Enterprise Excelsior*...engage! This is it! Get ready!

**CID:** Eye of mine enemy! Render unto me thy power! Ugh... No... You will not claim me! I am the master!

**ALPHINAUD:** Yaaaaaargh!

**BIGGS:** We're through!

**CID:** Chief! We've got an imperial battleship on our tail! And it's bleedin' *massive*!

**WEDGE:** Damn it! The bastards were waiting for us to open the door for them! I'm going to try to shake them! Hang on to something!

**BIGGS:** Uwaaaaaah! We're all going to die! Tataruuu!

**ICEHEART:** She won't take much more of this!

**ALPHINAUD:** The time is come to use Hydaelyn's gift. Much blood has been spilled in my name. And for what? For a false cause that I created for want of the warmth of companionship. Saint Shiva...Hraesvelgr... Pray forgive this fool. But even now, I cannot let go of my dream─my dream of a tomorrow in which no child need freeze alone in the snow. Thank you, Hraesvelgr.

**ICEHEART:** Is that...Ysayle? What does she mean to do!?

**ALPHINAUD:** O goddess born of mine own hopes and dreams.
For the last time, I beseech you! Fill this vessel with your light! Still the hatred
within our hearts and bless us with eternal grace! Farewell, Warrior of Light. And thank you─for showing me the way.

**YSHTOLA:** NOOOOOO!

**ESTINIEN:** This aether... It was a Crystal of Light. She, too, was one of Hydaelyn's chosen...

**REGULA:** Fare you well, my lady.

**YSHTOLA:** Our objective lies at the heart of the isle. The Third will remain to guard the ship, while the Second patrols the perimeter and eliminates any threats. The First will come with me to secure the research facility. Let no man doubt the import of our mission: the Allagans found a means to capture eikons alive, and their knowledge lies hid upon this isle. If we can but acquire it, we would be able to prevent the beings from returning to plague us, thus ending the cycle of rebirth. I need not remind you that success will raise our legion high in the Emperor's regard. Yet, by the same token, His Radiance does not tolerate failure. That is all. All troops, prepare for deployment!

**ALPHINAUD:** So that is their purpose.

**YSHTOLA:** To think that the knowledge used to bind no less a being than Bahamut sleeps here...

**ALPHINAUD:** Imprisoning a primal in such a manner would represent an effective means to halt the cycle of summoning─were it not for the grave and obvious risks.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed. We need but refer to past experience─that of Bahamut's calamitous return─to see why this is not the solution we seek.

**ESTINIEN:** Held in duress, a primal will continue to nurse its hatred for mankind. And when it inevitably breaks free, its rage will be beyond quelling.

**ALPHINAUD:** Whatever folly the Garleans mean to commit, they can wait. We must remain focused on our task.

**REGULA:** Yes, of course. It would not be polite to keep the archbishop waiting.

**ESTINIEN:** That would explain my men's silence. We meet again. And this time, we will not be interrupted. Come! Show me your power, champions of Eorzea! I had heard the tales of your strength, Warrior of Light. And now that I have experienced it firsthand, van Baelsar's defeat seems less inexplicable. You are a formidable foe, and I have thoroughly enjoyed our time together. Alas, all good things must come to an end. Allagan secrets await, and there is no profit to be had in remaining here. Keep them occupied!

**YSHTOLA:** Coward...

**ALPHINAUD:** It would seem we have no choice.

**ESTINIEN:** You must continue on. We will hold them here.

**YSHTOLA:** Take the Eye. It should still hold enough energy to be of use to you. I shall join you as soon as I am able.

**TIAMAT:** Enough talk! Make haste and stop the archbishop!

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-???-)Who cometh to this forsaken place and disturbeth my solitude?

**TIAMAT:** Tiamat, my child.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-Tiamat-)...Father? Can it truly be you?

**TIAMAT:** None other. My form is such that I may journey with Hydaelyn's chosen─ A mortal who desireth to end the war between man and dragon.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-Tiamat-)Millennia have passed since I was brought low by the men of Allag. To think that war rageth still between our kinds... (-Tiamat-)Hearken to my tale, child of man. I am Tiamat, of Midgardsormr's first brood. (-Tiamat-)In a time before time, my father did come to this star, bearing seven eggs.

**TIAMAT:** From these eggs did my children hatch. And once they were full-grown, they took wing and spread across all the lands of Hydaelyn.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** (-Tiamat-)Together with my brood-brother Bahamut, I journeyed south to Meracydia. And together, we brought forth innumerable children into the world. (-Tiamat-)We abided in peace, and all was well...until the men of Allag came, some five thousand years since. They slaughtered my children in droves, and took from me my beloved Bahamut. (-Tiamat-)'Twas then, when I had fallen into the depths of despair, that black-robed men came unto me. The Ascians. (-Tiamat-)They offered to resurrect Bahamut through their dark arts, and I, in my grief, accepted─a decision which I shall regret unto my dying breath. (-Tiamat-)For what they brought back was a mockery of my beloved. Worse, the Ascians gifted his murderers the means to entrap him. (-Tiamat-)Know this, child of man: the beings thy kind call gods are but specters of thy mind's creation, given form at great cost to Hydaelyn. (-Tiamat-)Many such beings yet slumber across the land, brought to heel by the selfsame empire that bound me. They must not be released into the world. (-Tiamat-)If thou wouldst end the conflict, vanquish thee the Ascians, and deliver the weak of will from the bonds of their dark influence.

**TIAMAT:** It hath been five thousand years, my child. Wilt thou not forgive thyself?

**HYDAELYN:** (-Tiamat-)The release of death is denied me here, yet I desire not freedom. Nay, Father. I shall live with my regret until the world itself hath ceased to be. (-Tiamat-)Such is my just punishment for consorting with Darkness─for calling forth a loathsome and lamentable creature which blackeneth my beloved's memory.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Warrior of Light. Beloved daughter. The Light abideth within thy heart again. Full valiantly didst thou overcome thy many trials. But glory not in thy success. For the servants of Darkness are ever close at hand. Receive of me my blessing once more, And go forth, to shine thy Light on all creation.

**LAHABREA:** Thou hast broken down the wall I built around thee, and partaken of thy mistress's blessing once more. Strong art thou, mortal─stronger than any other of thy kind. Having looked upon thy deeds, I am convinced. Thou art worthy to bear Her Light. The covenant bound me to thee, but 'twould seem our fates were mingled from the first. Though I will not fight thy battles, I will yet lend thee my wings. Come, mortal─we go to cast out the Darkness!

**IGEYOHRM:** The champion of Hydaelyn.

**LAHABREA:** Tell me: why do you despise the primals so? They are the embodiment of mortal will─of mortal desire. Plainly, you *desire* a foe to despise. And 'tis well
that you do, for it is from the vortex of ceaseless conflict
that Lord Zodiark shall be reborn.

**IGEYOHRM:** Through the Joining, the world shall become whole again. Then all shall be as once it was─as it should ever have remained.

**LAHABREA:** For the glory of Lord Zodiark.

**IGEYOHRM:** Your meddling ends here and now, Warrior of Light! Such strength! It defies all reason...

**LAHABREA:** No! I will not be bested by the likes of them! Lahabrea! It is time!

**IGEYOHRM:** Very well. Let us show these mortals the true power of the Echo... The power to break down the barriers of existence!

**LAHABREA:** I am become you...

**ASCIANPRIME:** ...And we are become one.

**LAHABREA:** Come, mortals! Render up your souls, that Lord Zodiark might be reborn! Aaargh!!! What walls are these? Arrrgh! Damn you, Hydaelyn!

**IGEYOHRM:** That she might regain the blessing of Light I had foreseen... But she is grown so strong in it as to deny us our power.

**LAHABREA:** Let us withdraw, Lahabrea. That power remains to us, at least. Impossible! Aaaaaahhh!

**THORDAN:** So you harnessed the Eye's power... A pity you spent it all. What will you do now, hero?

**LAHABREA:** So, not even the vaunted Warrior of Light can unmake an Ascian without relying upon mortal contrivances.

**THORDAN:** You!

**LAHABREA:** In the distant past, King Thordan and his knights twelve fought and defeated Nidhogg. Though the victory cost them dear, they were rewarded with a great prize: the dread wyrm's eyes, both of which have since been held in the Holy See's safekeeping. The Eye you possess was Nidhogg's left, and long has it served as the source of the Azure Dragoon's might. As for its twin... It has lain here, joined to the person of Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon. For though he learned to harness its power, he was ultimately consumed by it. Even in death, his body decays not─a pitiful end for a fabled hero. My Ascian friend. Long have you and your kind sown the seeds of chaos by teaching mortals the secrets of summoning. But if you assumed that we would meekly serve as your pawns, then you are gravely mistaken.

**THORDAN:** You would raise a hand against us!?

**LAHABREA:** By taking unto my flesh the soul of the legendary King Thordan, I am become a god─ A god who knows not cessation, whose being is sustained by a millennium of fervent prayer and the Eye's nigh-bottomless reservoir of aether.

**THORDAN:** What!?

**LAHABREA:** Your contempt for man has proven your undoing, Ascian. For my first act as god-king, I do hereby sentence you to die.

**THORDAN:** Aaaaaargggh!

**ZEPHIRIN:** Gods feed upon aether. It matters not what form that aether takes. Ascian souls are no exception. With this power, I shall put an end to a thousand years of conflict. Be they sown by Ascian, dragon, or primal, wheresoever the seeds of chaos threaten to quicken, I shall excise them with my divine blade and bring order to the world. I am become that which you abhor, Warrior of Light. If you would take issue with my godhood, I shall answer you with my blade.

**THORDAN:** Brothers! The time is come to call upon the true power of the Heavens' Ward!

**ESTINIEN:** Fight me if you will, Warrior of Light. I care not. All who stand against me will be destroyed─
be they servants of the Darkness or the Light. By my blessing shall all men be sanctified, and an endless era
of peace begin. Vice and conflict shall cease to be. You reject my divinity, yet what have you to offer
my people in its stead? Bitter truth? Virtuous suffering? No matter. If you believe your cause just,
I call upon you to defend it with your life! How...how can this be? A millennium of prayer
and the Eye's power combined─and still you stand? Who─*what* are you?

**NIDHOGG:** ...It is over, then? I had hoped that mine would be the hand to end it...but knowing you, there was little chance of that. 'Twould seem the Eye has served you well. Its twin... At long last... All that remains is to take them beyond the reach of man and dragon both. With this task accomplished, my toils shall finally be at an end.

**ESTINIEN:** Thou hadst done well to resist mine influence, bathed in my power and blood as thou wert. Alas, in thine anticipation of comfort, thou hast lowered thy guard! The keening of my fallen kindred... Their smoldering desire for vengeance... Mine eyes have partaken of a thousand years of pain─a pain which I shall bestow upon thee. Drink deep of my rage, mortal...AND BECOME ME!

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Grrraaarrrgh!!!

**WEDGE:** Nidhogg, my child... What hath thy fury made of thee...? Let us away, servant of Hydaelyn.

**BIGGS:** Chief! Over there!

**CID:** Oi!

**YSHTOLA:** Haha! Godsdammit, do you always have to cut it so bloody close!?

**ALPHINAUD:** It would seem she has done it again.

**YSHTOLA:** Was there ever any doubt? Let us return to Ishgard. Our friends will be eager to learn the battle's outcome...and welcome back their champion.

**AYMERIC:** Where is Estinien?

**ALPHINAUD:** I daresay you are the first soul in Ishgardian history to arrive in our city upon dragonback. This scene shall be remembered for a thousand years to come.

**YSHTOLA:** As we had feared, the archbishop summoned the soul of King Thordan unto himself and thence became a primal.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** But he and his knights are no more, thanks to the Warrior of Light.

**AYMERIC:** Your struggles are not yet over, mortals.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Whom do I have the pleasure...?

**AYMERIC:** I am Midgardsormr. I have journeyed with Hydaelyn's champion and observed her deeds in the conflict between man and dragon. Tell me, children of Thordan. Do you desire peace?

**MIDGARDSORMR:** My people have committed unspeakable atrocities against dragonkind─even against our own. Would that we could undo these wrongs...but we cannot. Be that as it may, the future yet presents a chance to begin anew. Our nation has broken free of the shackles of a false faith, and Nidhogg shall lead his kindred against us no more. I doubt not that it will require much effort and perseverance, but 'tis my belief that, in time, Ishgard will again become a place where man and dragon may abide together in harmony.

**AYMERIC:** I shall remember thy words. Yet be warned: Nidhogg's soul liveth on. His unbridled rage hath claimed for its vessel the one thou callest the Azure Dragoon.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Estinien!

**AYMERIC:** Doubt not but that Nidhogg will call out to his brood ere long, nor that they shall answer him. Steel yourselves, for the true test is yet to come.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Come what may, we will never cease to believe. Upon the souls of they who have sacrificed themselves to pave the way for peace, we will never abandon our cause.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**AYMERIC:** Let all here present attest that Ser Aymeric, acting on
behalf of the archbishop, has appended his signature. I do hereby declare... That from this day forth, the Holy See of Ishgard
shall once more be counted a member of the Eorzean Alliance. Let our nations move forward as one,
and stand united against the Garlean Empire!

**RAUBAHNMERLWYBKANESENNA:** For the future of Eorzea!

**ALPHINAUD:** For the future of Eorzea!

**TATARU:** There you are. A noble monument to a noble soul.

**ALPHINAUD:** From here, Lord Haurchefant can watch over all of Ishgard...

**TATARU:** It has been a long and arduous journey.
And we have lost much and more along the way. Yet come what may, we must stay true to our purpose and press on.

**EDMONT:** That's right, you two! It's high time
we got back to rebuilding the Scions! Which means we're going to need money─and lots of it!

**ELIDIBUS:** So ends a glorious chapter in their tale. However, tumultuous days yet lie ahead for Ishgard. After a thousand years under the yoke of the church,
the people take their first tentative steps into the unknown. And though they spy a glimmer of peace upon the horizon,
Nidhogg's vengeful shadow yet remains to darken the way. Be that as it may... So long as the young commander of the Temple Knights
and his heroic companions are there to guide them,
the people may hold fast to hope─ the hope that, one day, true peace will return to Ishgard,
and that man and dragon may live in harmony once more. Let the deeds writ herein never be forgot, that they may inspire generations yet unborn to strive ever heavensward.

**CID:** (-Elidibus-)So Lahabrea and Igeyorhm have fallen. (-Elidibus-)Bested by mortals in their attempt to initiate the eighth Rejoining. That they should be so complacent... (-Elidibus-)And now it falls to me to deal with the consequences... (-Elidibus-)Without intervention, the balance between Light and Darkness will begin to shift, placing our mission in jeopardy. (-Elidibus-)Hydaelyn's champion has grown too strong. Her might encroaches upon the realm of gods. (-Elidibus-)Equilibrium must needs be restored. The time is come for you and yours to join the fray... (-Elidibus-)...Warrior of Darkness.

**YSHTOLA:** Remind me: why is there no rest for the righteous?

**CID:** Because they *care*, Master Garlond.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you for coming. I wished to speak with you both in a place where privacy was assured.

**AYMERIC:** We quite understand. What was it that you wished to discuss?

**ALPHINAUD:** With my father's passing, the seat of the archbishop lies vacant. And so, in accordance with canon law, I have assumed his responsibilities. I should stress that this is a temporary measure. It was never intended that the lord commander of the Temple Knights serve in this capacity indefinitely. Quite the opposite. The statutes specify that I should surrender my powers as soon as a conclave of the senior clergy and the High Houses have named a new archbishop. But in light of recent events, that would not seem appropriate.

**AYMERIC:** I confess, I did not expect you to divulge quite so much quite so soon. The details of the archbishop's plans, perhaps...but the true origin of the war and all it entails...?

**ALPHINAUD:** I too had concerns. But when the Warrior of Light is witnessed returning to the capital upon the back of a dragon, one's options are rather limited. Mayhap I could have concealed certain details...but for how long? And at what risk? Should the truth have come to light in the meantime, how would the people have viewed my silence? After a thousand years of lies and secrecy, I could not well abuse their trust and hope to be believed. The time for deception has passed. ...I only wish the people agreed. That some would deny the truth, I had anticipated─but not *this* many. And among the few who acknowledge that my father had to be stopped, no small number question our methods.

**LUCIA:** If they suspect a coup, it will not be long before some turn to violence.

**AYMERIC:** It has already begun─and that on both sides. Men and women of the cloth are being harassed in the streets. Some have even been assaulted in the Brume. Hilda and her people have formed a watch to help us maintain order, but such measures will not prevent the unrest from spreading.

**ALPHINAUD:** For all our talk of peace, the people remain frightened and confused. For their sake, we must bring the Dragonsong War to a definitive end.

**LUCIA:** And we should be glad to help you, Ser Aymeric. But what precisely would you have us do?

**ALPHINAUD:** We wish to treat with the dragons of Anyx Trine. To that end, I would trouble you for an escort and an introduction.

**AYMERIC:** Anyx Trine? ...You would speak with *Vidofnir*, then?

**EDMONT:** We must needs open a dialogue between our peoples. Acting as my representative, Lucia will extend an invitation to their leader, that she might visit us here in Ishgard. Were she still with us, I would of course have beseeched Ysayle's assistance in this matter. But as she is not, I must ask that you aid us in her stead. Will you do us this favor? Thank you, my friends. Lucia─I leave the rest to you.

**KRILE:** In the wake of the archbishop's fall, the nation of Ishgard trembled, the faith of her people shaken to its very core. For a thousand years had they fought and died, certain of the justice of their cause,
only to be told that their holy war was born of the sins of their forefathers. What then, for those brave men and women, thus stripped of their righteousness, but to despair?
To deny the truth and decry its speakers? And what then for those whom they defamed but to hope on? To have faith in a brighter tomorrow? A tomorrow in which man and dragon might live together in harmony─
then as distant as the very stars in the heavens... Yet while we dared to hope, deep within his lair, the enemy lay gathering his strength. Nidhogg, now possessed of his two eyes and the body of the Azure Dragoon─
prizes to which he had laid claim at the very hour of the heroes' triumph. As desperately as we sought the solace of peace, the great wyrm craved the misery of war.
Nor was he alone in this misbegotten desire...

**YSHTOLA:** I am terribly, terribly sorry to have kept you all waiting!

**KRILE:** You need not apologize. We arrived but a moment ago ourselves. Pray allow me to introduce Krile, who is recently come from the Sharlayan motherland. She has generously offered to assist us.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh please, think nothing of it! A trip to Eorzea was long overdue. You must be the Warrior of Light. Yes...you certainly do look the part. A pleasure to meet you at last, miss. And who is that I spy but young Alphinaud Leveilleur himself! I daresay someone's grown an ilm or two in my absence─or are those lifts in your boots?

**KRILE:** We, uh... Ahem. Miss Krile and I met at the Studium, years ago. I shall forever be indebted to her for her sage guidance.

**ALPHINAUD:** It was no small task keeping him out of trouble, believe you me! The youngest ever to enter the Studium─him and his sister, eleven-year-old prodigies. Suffice it to say, social graces were not among his list of talents! Striding up to his seniors on his first day, head held high─what was it he said again...?

**KRILE:** *Thank you*, Krile!

**ALPHINAUD:** For what? I haven't finished yet. Would you care to attempt a more dextrous deflection?

**KRILE:** Ahem... Mayhap we should save this delightful conversation for a more fitting occasion, when pressing matters do not demand our undivided attention.

**YSHTOLA:** A bit much, but better. I can tell you have been putting your skills to use here in Eorzea. Henceforth, I trust you will dazzle me with your eloquence at the *first* time of asking. Right. On to more pressing matters─finding Minfilia and the other missing Scions!

**KRILE:** I gather you have new information to share with us?

**ALPHINAUD:** A new approach, actually. Tataru recounted the tale of your escape, and it gave me an idea. Simply put, assuming Thancred left some manner of trail when you whisked him away─as is almost always the case with teleportation magicks─I am confident I can find and follow it.

**KRILE:** Then what are you waiting for!?

**YSHTOLA:** The wherewithal to do it. The fact is, my abilities aren't quite up to the task. Not in themselves, anyway. If I had Master Matoya's Crystal Eye, on the other hand...

**MATOYA:** Then let us all call on her forthwith. I think it best that you explain your plan to her in person.

**YSHTOLA:** <sigh> Is that trouble I smell, or did you forget to wipe your boots on the way in?

**MATOYA:** Forgive us, Master Matoya. We will be sure to wipe them on the way out. And may I say how glad I am that age has not yet deprived you of your senses.

**KRILE:** Ever so quick-witted, aren't we─to the detriment of your manners. Well, out with it then. What do you want?

**MATOYA:** Pray allow me to introduce myself, Master Matoya. I am Krile, of the Students of Baldesion. I hope you will excuse our unannounced visit.

**KRILE:** Baldesion, you say? Ah yes, the old coot set up shop on the Isle of Val, didn't he?

**ALPHINAUD:** Regrettably, our order's headquarters─and the isle itself─were obliterated by a magick of immense power. I have the blessing of Light to thank for my own preservation.

**KRILE:** Krile─you too possess the Echo!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Well yes, of course I do. Our order is devoted to uncovering the mysteries of Hydaelyn and interpreting Her will, particularly through the study of Her gift to us. It was in the course of these studies that I met and subsequently befriended Minfilia. She and I have rather a lot in common.

**KRILE:** I had no idea.

**MATOYA:** You weren't supposed to. Not that I wanted to deceive you, you understand, but precautions had to be taken.

**KRILE:** Yes, yes─that's all well and good, but you still haven't told me why you're here.

**MATOYA:** The Students of Baldesion are gone, and there is naught I can do to change that. But the Scions of the Seventh Dawn can yet be restored and my dear friend found. You have in your possession an ancient Crystal of Light─one you call your “Crystal Eye.” I believe I can use it to focus my abilities and locate one of the missing Scions.

**YSHTOLA:** And there I was thinking you might want to make use of my *years of experience*... <sigh> Wait here.

**KRILE:** Long did I ponder the nature of this crystal and its familiar radiance...but never did I suspect it was a Crystal of Light.

**MATOYA:** On the cusp of an Umbral Calamity, souls blessed with the power of the Echo invariably appear. To aid these Her chosen warriors, Hydaelyn bequeaths to each a sliver of Her strength in the form of a Crystal of Light. But as Her strength wanes, so too does the potency of Her gifts. This crystal, born of an earlier era, is infused with a power far greater than those of this age.

**KRILE:** You could travel the length and breadth of the land and not find a crystal even a fraction as pure. Its value is beyond measure─as are the risks inherent in its use.

**MATOYA:** No two manifestations of the Echo are alike. I, for example, can converse with beings of every shape and size─excepting beasts, contrary to what others would have you believe. Language has nothing to do with it, of course; rather, I am sensitive to the whispers of the soul. Their intent, their very essence even─the traces of which served to guide the elementals to Y'shtola. Far-fetched though it may sound, I believe that with your Crystal Eye, I may be able to pick up where they left off and follow the remaining trail to Thancred. That is, if I have your permission...?

**KRILE:** Well, the poor sod's not going to find himself. So, as long as you don't drop it or take it out of my sight, you may do with it what you will.

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you, Master Matoya! Then let us begin. From the Black Shroud, the trail continues to the north and west...towards a mountain...the foot of Sohm Al. It was a near thing, but he was not deposited within the rock. I think.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** The hunters of Tailfeather know those lands well. I say we begin our search there! Who else could be... Thancred! It could be Thancred! We must hurry!

**ASCIAN:** (-???-)SHORT ATTACK GRUNT - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY (-???-)SHORT ATTACK GRUNT - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY (-???-)SHORT ATTACK GRUNT - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY (-???-)CHARGING ATTACK ROAR - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY (-???-)This day we reclaim the reins of history! This day we rid ourselves of the Ascians forever!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** (-Black-robed Ascian-)Fools playing at heroes, all of you. Is this how you believe you can save your world?

**YSHTOLA:** (-???-)We can and will, Ascian! You shall see─or perhaps you will not! (-???-)So you are the Warrior of Light. The *savior* of Eorzea. (-???-)It's a wonder you didn't come sooner, what with the primal and all. Lost a step, have we?

**ALPHINAUD:** Have care. The aether moves strangely around him.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** It would seem we share a common enemy. Mayhap you would tell us who you are?

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)...Shall we show them?

**YSHTOLA:** SHORT DEFENDING EXHALATION - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY SHORT DEFENDING EXHALATION - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY

**THANCRED:** SHORT DEFENDING EXHALATION - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY SHORT DEFENDING EXHALATION - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** SHORT ATTACK GRUNT - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY SHORT ATTACK GRUNT - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY SHORT ATTACK GRUNT - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY

**KRILE:** (-???-)Not very sporting of you to interrupt, but so be it. Mark well our faces, Warrior of Light, for we are the Warriors of Darkness. Walkers of a different path. And we shall meet again.

**ALPHINAUD:** Warriors of Darkness? ...Really?

**THANCRED:** Thancred! Are you all right?

**YSHTOLA:** Pleasantries can wait. I'd rather not be here when the Gnath arrive. Agreed?

**THANCRED:** Suffice it to say, our reunion was not at all as I pictured it. Waiting until the last instant to join the fray. 'Tis plain you have not lost your appetite for the dramatic.

**YSHTOLA:** *My* appetite for the dramatic!? Have you forgotten the circumstances of our parting? The heroic last stand, the tunnel filling with light, and then... <sigh> Had I known you intended to use forbidden magicks to deliver me to some godsforsaken wilderness... ...I would have thanked you in advance.

**THANCRED:** Thancred...

**ALPHINAUD:** If nothing else, you might have warned me that I would emerge from the Lifestream in the altogether. Eventually, I managed to fashion knives from some obsidian I found, and set about hunting for meat and hides. Given that I'm not all that skilled in leatherworking, it's probably for the best that I met the Vath before I was reunited with you.

**THANCRED:** So *you* were the “fleshling clothed in skins” of whom the storyteller spoke.

**YSHTOLA:** A description which fit me as ill as the skins themselves. Happily, I was able to trade with the Vath for garments better becoming a man of refinement. From them I learned of Ravana, and of the great warrior who had once laid him low.

**THANCRED:** And thence did you conclude that were you to track the primal's movements, it would surely bring you into contact with the Scions once more.

**ALPHINAUD:** It seemed a reasonable assumption. I could think of no one else with your enthusiasm for slaying beastman gods. Until now, that is.

**KRILE:** Ah yes...the self-proclaimed “Warriors of Darkness.” 'Tis only fitting that they stand in opposition to the Warrior of Light, I suppose.

**ALPHINAUD:** I glimpsed the leader's past─if only for a moment. They were confronting a man in black. An Ascian, I think.

**EDMONT:** If these warriors are capable of doing battle with Ascians and primals both, they must be possessed of powerful protection─protection not unlike the Echo...

**LUCIA:** Even as the Scions celebrated the return of a long-lost friend, honorable men plotted to deprive them of another. Honorable men, to whom Ser Aymeric was no hero but a scheming patricide. Honorable men, who would fain wash the paving stones of Foundation with the tyrant's blood. Honorable men, whose knife in the dark was the spark which set the city aflame. And who sang as it burned.

**THANCRED:** I do not mean to diminish our accomplishments, but until we identify the ones who ordered the fires set, our work is far from finished.

**AYMERIC:** Between the various conservative and religious factions in Ishgard, I daresay there is no shortage of parties who would like to see the status quo preserved. Do any likely suspects spring to mind?

**LUCIA:** Far too many to count.

**AYMERIC:** Lord Commander, your wounds!

**TEMPLERKNIGHT10810:** Are healing well, thank you. Time is of the essence. Lest we forget, these men would sooner put their own city to the torch than see it change. When our enemies learn that we have apprehended their arsonist, there is no telling how they will react.

**AYMERIC:** Lord Commander! An armed mob has seized control of the Vault!

**TEMPLERKNIGHT10810:** And now we know. Tell us what happened, ser. Spare no detail.

**AYMERIC:** We were directing refugees into the basilica, as you ordered, when all of a sudden, men brandishing weapons were all around us. It happened so fast, my lord. We had no time to respond. They've taken the refugees hostage and barricaded themselves inside the Vault.

**TEMPLERKNIGHT10810:** And they sent you to deliver their demands.

**LUCIA:** They...the True Brothers of the Faith demand that a conclave to select the next archbishop be held forthwith. Furthermore, th-they declare that you, Lord Commander, are guilty of patricide and high treason, and that you must surrender yourself at once to receive of the Fury's judgment.

**ARTOIREL:** Ridiculous! Do they honestly think that executing Ser Aymeric will change anything? That the truth will somehow die with him?

**EDMONT:** These fundamentalists rage against the passing of the old ways, unable to accept there can be no going back.

**AYMERIC:** Given the fanciful nature of their demands, a peaceful resolution does not seem likely. If the hostages are to be rescued, it will be by force, I fear.

**LUCIA:** Agreed. Lucia, take a contingent of knights and establish a perimeter outside the entrance.

**AYMERIC:** At once, Lord Commander!

**ALPHINAUD:** Hilda, I need your people out in force throughout the Brume. When word spreads of the situation, the friends and family of the hostages may try to take matters into their own hands. I will not give these militants more targets. I shall lead the assault on the Vault. Master Alphinaud, can I count on the support of the Scions?

**AYMERIC:** Of course!

**ARTOIREL:** We are in your debt.

**AYMERIC:** I shall join you as well, Lord Commander!

**ISHGARDIANPRIEST:** Your assistance is most welcome, Lord Artoirel. To arms then, friends! Time is against us! Where is he? Where is he!?

**AYMERIC:** Come no closer!

**ISHGARDIANPRIEST:** You have nowhere to run! Release the girl and surrender!

**AYMERIC:** Surrender to whom!? The blasphemer who throws wide the gates to our enemy, who breaks bread with him and calls him brother!? Ungodly swine! I would sooner *die* than surrender to you!

**ISHGARDIANPRIEST:** Is it *godly* to spill the blood of an innocent child!? To burn the homes of your brothers!? Tell me, priest─*is that godly*!?

**MAELIE:** Do not speak to me of godliness, heathen! Your father's blood is on your hands─as is hers!

**LUCIA:** TERRIFIED SCREAM - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY What? But I...

**VIDOFNIR:** Vidofnir!

**LUCIA:** Well met, knight. Mayhap I chose an inopportune moment?

**VIDOFNIR:** Not at all! Pray forgive us this most unworthy reception. We are honored to have you with us, and right glad of your aid!

**MAELIE:** Fortune delivered the child unto me. I had but to receive her.

**VIDOFNIR:** Thank you for savin' me...

**AYMERIC:** Thou art welcome, child.

**VIDOFNIR:** Never did I think to be indebted to so unexpected a savior. But full glad am I to be so.

**AYMERIC:** Friend of Ysayle, warrior of warriors, I had hoped to meet with thee. I bear a message from my sire.

**VIDOFNIR:** From Hraesvelgr?

**ALPHINAUD:** Upon returning to our lands, Nidhogg's shade did sing unto his brood, and they for skies unknown did then take wing. This thou must know, for your fates are inextricably bound. 

**VIDOFNIR:** What of Estinien? Is he truly lost to us?

**EDMONT:** Such matters are beyond my ken. I but bear my father's words. Take from them what thou wilt. Fare you well, mortals.

**AYMERIC:** So it is as they say, then. A great white dragon swooped down from the heavens to rescue an innocent child.

**EDMONT:** A most unexpected turn of events...but not an unwelcome one. The people will not soon forget this day.

**AYMERIC:** Yet how will they choose to remember it, Ser Aymeric? And will these events serve to bring man and dragon closer together, or drive a deeper wedge between brothers? After a thousand years, the world these men once knew is changing─and with ungentle swiftness to boot. Though their actions are misguided, their sentiments are only to be expected. You may be sure that others will rally to their cause. I share your desire for a lasting peace with the Dravanians, I do, but I would not see it built on the bones of our countrymen─nor on our own. I see much of Haurchefant in you. And I could not bear to mourn the passing of another son.

**ALPHINAUD:** Lord Edmont...

**ARTOIREL:** That Vidofnir should chance to arrive even as the girl fell... Truly, I could not have planned it better myself.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, good. We were afraid you might have left.

**ARTOIREL:** A shield, my lord?

**ALPHINAUD:** Fit for a true knight. An expression of our gratitude to you and yours, long overdue. ...But there is something else I would discuss ere you part. Something which cannot leave this room. My father will soon step down as head of our house. Ser Aymeric was not the only one to fall under suspicion following the death of the archbishop. There are some who believe my father complicit in a coup d'état. Thus he intends to renounce his title to absolve our house of suspicion and secure the support of our peers.

**ARTOIREL:** Surely there must be another way to convince houses Durendaire and Dzemael?

**000:** So I said to him. Alas, he will not budge. Ever since I was a child, I knew that I would one day succeed my father, and the thought of it filled me with pride. Yet once I learned the day was at hand, my heart was filled with naught but dread. Our legacy is built upon the lies of our forefathers. In accepting this title, am I not perpetuating this injustice? Why should I become the next count?

**ARTOIREL:** What will you say? A knight lives to serve. ...

**EDMONT:** You sound just like him. Aye, I suspect that is what Haurchefant would have said. “To aid those in need...” ...But then I thought of my brother. “A knight lives to serve─to aid those in need.” When you look on that shield, I trust you will remember his words. And should I once more find my resolve wavering, I ask that you show me the way. You were a sister to Haurchefant. Will you be a sister to me as well? Come, Emmanellain. There is much to be done. For Father, and for Ser Aymeric. And for Ishgard. <sigh> To think we share the same blood... Pray excuse us.

**NARRATION:** Those were the days of promises and vows─of tentative first steps into an uncertain future. A future shaped by the choices we made, in ways we could never have foreseen. Born of good and evil, of light and darkness, and shepherded by our hand. Be it for weal, or be it for woe.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**THANCRED:** Well done, sir. And with that, I believe we are ready to proceed.

**KRILE:** Let us be about our business then. The next patrol may not be so credulous.

**THANCRED:** Why must you be so disappointingly brusque? You're not at all as Minfilia described, you know. I don't think you've favored me with so much as a single compliment since we set out. Tell me, did your time in the wilderness sap you of all your charm, or are you holding it in reserve for your beloved?

**KRILE:** This is neither the time nor the place.

**THANCRED:** Well, call me old-fashioned, but when I'm risking life and limb infiltrating an imperial castrum, I like to be sure of my comrades' motivations.

**KRILE:** I see now where Alphinaud gets it from. Minfilia is dear to me, it is true─but not in the way you think. Fifteen years past, when she was still but a child, there was an incident at a parade. A goobbue broke free of its fetters and ran amok through the streets of Ul'dah. Had I been more attentive, I could have prevented it...but I was distracted, and her father was killed. I feared she would never recover, but in the years that followed, she showed herself to be more resilient than I had ever imagined. And when she learned of her gift, she did not flinch from the responsibility, but sought to guide others on the path. She touched the hearts of all around her. Mine, Louisoix's, every Scion's. In those dark days following the Calamity, she was our guiding light─our hope for a brighter future. She had so many dreams...and I would give anything to make them come true.

**THANCRED:** My apologies. I can see she means the world to you. I did not mean to pick at old scars.

**KRILE:** No harm done, I assure you. But fair is fair, my lady─what is Minfilia to you?

**THANCRED:** You mean you don't know? Only my dearest friend. When I finally emerged from my torpor, I learned that nary a day had passed without her asking after me. She never gave up hope. And neither will I.

**MINFILIA:** Then for Minfilia's sake, let us pray that these vestiges of Hydaelyn's intervention will lead us to her.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hear... Feel... Think... (-???-)Through time and space hast thou journeyed unto me...as I knew thou wouldst. We are the Word of the Mother. We who were once called “Minfilia.” Much time hath passed for thee, since the bloody banquet. Since...since I hearkened to Her word. Mother... Hydaelyn guided me...towards Y'shtola and Thancred, that I might be swept up in their Flow...and delivered unto the aetherial sea... There, adrift and alone, Her voice silent once more, I prayed... For those we have lost. For those we can yet save. To Her I would make an offering... We speak now with one Voice. One Will. One Word. Unto thee we bequeath the most precious of gifts: the truth which lieth at the heart of this world. Thus do we beseech thee once more... Hear... Feel... Think... Before there was life, in the depths of the aetherial sea, Light and Dark did once dwell as one. But the Darkness coveted power, and the balance was broken. Thus was I forced to banish Him unto the distant heavens, to forever remain apart. A moon bound. In sundering the star did we cry out, and the barriers 'twixt planes chance to falter. Across ten and three were we then divided. Reflections of the Source, each possessed of a shard. Zodiark longeth to be made whole. For His restoration, for His resurrection, His servants labor without cease. They seek to tear down the barriers which surround the Source. Thus do they rejoice in their Ardor─in your calamities─for each marks a Rejoining. Seven times have they succeeded. Seven times hath the Darkness grown stronger. Seven times have I failed. The Ascians cannot be suffered to continue. This...this is my final... The Crystal's power is all but spent. With what remains, I will return you to the shore of the aetherial sea. Blessed children, go forth and seek...seek...

**THANCRED:** You've had another vision, haven't you? Let us return to Master Matoya's cave. Everyone will wish to hear what you saw. Thank the Twelve!

**MATOYA:** Did you find her!? Did you find Minfilia!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Still in one piece, are we? Well? Did you learn anything?

**YSHTOLA:** The Word of the Mother...? I am not sure I understand.

**KRILE:** Nor am I. Krile?

**ALPHINAUD:** As unbelievable as it sounds, I see no reason to doubt her─the Word's tale. No one was more sensitive to the will of Hydaelyn than Minfilia. And if Hydaelyn has grown so weak that She can barely make Herself heard, it is not hard to see why Minfilia, having joined with Her, might struggle to maintain her own form.

**MATOYA:** *What*? Why would she need to “maintain her own form”? Are you saying─ Are you saying she's gone? But that cannot be! Not now, not after all we have accomplished! We were meant to usher in the dawn's light together!

**YSHTOLA:** She threw herself on the fire to fuel your “dawn's light,” boy. You'll just have to usher it in on your own.

**MATOYA:** Must you be so ungentle!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Tell me about the Scions, boy.

**MATOYA:** The...the Scions of the Seventh Dawn labor for Eorzea's salvation. Whenever the realm is threatened, be it by primal, Ascian, Garlean or any other, we take up arms in her defense, that all in Eorzea may live to see a brighter tomorrow.

**YSHTOLA:** And that's very noble of you. But in chasing after these lofty goals of yours, you seem to have lost sight of some basic truths. To win a war, you must be willing to do whatever it takes. To fight, to kill, and, if necessary, to die. The path you've chosen is paved with the dead. Walk it with your eyes open, or not at all.

**KRILE:** I know the truth of which you speak, and have from the first. If the Ascians will go to any lengths to resurrect their god, then we must needs be as committed to our cause─to unmask them and their schemes, and to crush them both utterly. Come. There is much to be done.

**ALPHINAUD:** Y-Yes, of course.

**AYMERIC:** Thancred, wait!  No... No, this is all wrong.

**WAITRESS02236:** A pleasure to see you again, my friend. I take it you received our invitation? Good, good... You of all people should be present. When the True Brothers of the Faith seized control of the Vault, I feared the worst. Yet in adversity were we blessed with the promise of peace between man and dragon, through Vidofnir's timely rescue of an innocent child. Timely, I say, though “miraculous” or “providential” might better describe the event. The gods themselves could not have devised a more fitting symbol of hope. Needless to say, we could scarce let such an opportunity pass us by, which is why I set about making formal arrangements for a peace conference between our peoples. You and yours have done more to bring us together than any, and it is only right that you attend. But, I confess, that is not the only reason I would be glad to have you there. Given Nidhogg's implacable opposition to the peace, it is possible that he and his followers may attempt to disrupt proceedings, in which event, your presence would be a comfort to all in attendance. Pray understand, I have no wish to invite the wyrm's ire, but if our fractured nation is to heal─if we are to move forward as a people united─then we must do whatever is necessary to bring about lasting change. 'Tis nothing, 'tis nothing. <sigh> Lucia cautioned me against giving vent to my passions, lest my wounds reopen. It has not been easy reaching out to our opponents in Ishgard, many of whom sympathized with the actions of the “True Brothers.” But in so doing, we have limited the influence of the zealots. The people are ready, my friend. This conference *must* go ahead! I knew you would understand. The conference will take place on the border of Ishgardian and Dravanian territory, in Falcon's Nest. Lucia is there seeing to the final preparations even as we speak. Pray join her at your earliest convenience─'twould not do for the guest of honor to arrive late, after all. Oh, and one more thing! A drink! We should make time for one. Once the conference is concluded, I mean. By my reckoning, 'tis long overdue.

**OLDWOMAN02236:** Welcome, welcome! Find yourself an empty seat, and I'll be with you in a moment. Cold out, en't it? Here─a mug on the house. Let's get some color back in them cheeks! 'Fraid food'll be a bit longer than usual. We've got a lot of hungry folk to feed what with the conference and all. <sigh> So many people with cause to celebrate. To think there could be peace in our time, after all them years of fightin'... When I heard about the conference, I knew I had to come. I knew I had to be here─to do my bit. My husband, he...he died fighting the dragons, you see... And here we are, about to break bread with them. You all right, my lover? You look tired. Reckon you could do with a good long rest. After all you've done, I'd say you've *earned* it. Sleep, now...sleeeeeep. Sleep and leave us to our affairs. This was never your fight.

**WAITRESS02236:** <sniffle> <sob> My son, they...they told me he walks in Halone's halls. Him and the rest of his unit.

**OLDWOMAN02236:** ...They told me the same.

**TRAITORB02236:** I expect they think it's comforting. Every time I come, I cry. I cannot bear to remember, but to forget would be a thousand times worse. Yet that is what they would have us do. Accept this truth for the sake of peace. Bury the past and look to the future. But *he* was my future. My flesh and blood─my heart...

**TRAITORC02236:** Is this it? Are we the only ones with the courage to oppose this madness? Cowards, the lot of 'em!

**TRAITORB02236:** They think only of the prize─of the peace Ser Aymeric promises them. They know in their hearts it's a lie, but they go along with it anyway, desperate fools. But not I. Not I! I see the wyrm that killed my brother in my dreams every night! And I will not rest until he lies broken at my feet! Him and every last one of his accursed kin!

**OLDWOMAN02236:** All this nonsense about kings of eld. As if I care what they did or didn't do! Makes no difference to me and mine! Have the dragons sued for peace in a thousand years? Have they bollocks! It's a bloody ruse is what it is! And Ser Aymeric and the rest of 'em've bloody fallen for it!

**WAITRESS02236:** But what can we do? They believe, and naught we can say will ever change their minds. Whether we like it or not, man and dragon will come together at Falcon's Nest, and all will be forgiven. Forgiven and forgotten.

**THANCRED:** No. I will not let that happen. They will remember the true face of the enemy. I will show it to them. And we will rise up against them once more!

**WAITRESS02236:** Hey! Hey! This is no time for napping! Do you have your wits about you? Good. Come with me─we have a crisis on our hands!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Hear me, brothers and sisters! Do not be fooled by the honeyed words of the Dravanians! The peace they promise is but a prelude to slaughter! Remember your husbands and wives, never returned from war! Your children, torn apart by fang and claw! All your loved ones, shown no mercy! Does not your heart cry out for vengeance!? Your blood boil at the injustice!? Remember the face of your enemy, brothers and sisters! Remember it and strike back!

**CAVALRY02236:** You there! Don't just stand around gawping! Do something, man! Stop her!

**WAITRESS02236:** Yes, yes, my lord!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Augh! See! See here the true nature of the highborn! With lies and deception they lead us to our doom, and dare we raise our voices in dissent─death is our reward! This is the choice they have given us, brothers and sisters! Death by dragon's fang or death by nobleman's command! Death to all we hold dear! I spit on your choices, nobleman! You will take no more from me... No more! NO MORE!

**CAVALRY02236:** What have you done!?

**EMMANELLAIN:** I─ I only did as you ordered, my lord...

**HONOROIT:** I gave no such order! I did not! I...I never meant for anyone to... Honoroit! No, no! What have they done to you!? Honoroit! Honoroit!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Is that you, my lord? You...you seem rather flustered.

**HONOROIT:** Because of you, you imbecile! What in the seven hells happened to you!?

**EMMANELLAIN:** My...my apologies... Some few of the guests expressed a wish to leave...and I implored them to stay. It would seem they took issue with my request.

**HONOROIT:** Gods forgive me... If I had only been more careful with my words!

**EMMANELLAIN:** D-Do not blame yourself, my lord... I know... I know that you and your brother have Ishgard's best interests at heart. That poor woman... She lives in the past, clinging to the memories of the lost. But the future holds so much promise. So much joy. And you...you know that better than any...

**THANCRED:** Honoroit!?

**EMMANELLAIN:** Calm yourself. The boy will live. But it's imperative we get him inside and into the care of a chirurgeon without delay.

**THANCRED:** Gah! We were so close! Why does it all have to fall to pieces!? Don't they *want* to live in peace!? Don't they *want* to be happy!? We all want the same thing, and still─STILL it falls to pieces! Tell me: what─what was I supposed to do, hm!? Someone, anyone, tell me: *what was I supposed to do*!?

**EMMANELLAIN:** Stop looking to others. You make your choice and you live with the consequences.

**THANCRED:** And what would *you* know about consequences!? You who always know just what to say, and just what to do! Your every deed is greeted with a round of applause!

**EMMANELLAIN:** You know *nothing* about me. I have fought tooth and nail for the people I hold dear─done *everything* in my power to save them...and I have failed. Learn to live with it. I have.

**AYMERIC:** Lord Commander, if I may. I wished to speak with you before the grand melee.

**EMMANELLAIN:** Proceed.

**AYMERIC:** How do you do it, my lord? How do you lead with such certainty when so many of our countrymen will not hear of peace with the Dravanians? Some of them hate you almost as much as the dragons themselves. They decry you as a patricide in the streets. They even tried to kill you, for gods' sakes! Yet still you march on, undaunted, where no archbishop dared to tread. What is your secret? Where do you find the strength?

**EMMANELLAIN:** For centuries, our nation has been punished for the sins of our forefathers. If our punishment is to end, I believe we must right the wrongs of antiquity and move forward as a nation united. Needless to say, my father did not share this opinion. He did not believe the people strong enough to bring about their own deliverance, trusting only in himself. Tyranny seemed to him the only solution. But I have faith in the people, Lord Emmanellain. I have faith that they will weather this storm, and overcome every trial we set before them. Many have fought and died to see this blight upon our nation's history cleansed, and I would not let their sacrifices be in vain. Though we invite reprisals, the risk is worth the reward.

**AYMERIC:** I want to believe...I do... Lord Commander─through my careless orders, a pall has been cast over these proceedings, and I beg the opportunity to make amends. I, Emmanellain de Fortemps, do hereby request leave to take part in the grand melee!

**EDMONT:** Who am I to deny such a heartfelt plea? We would be honored to have you join the fray, my lord.

**AYMERIC:** You will take charge of the Ishgardian forces?

**EDMONT:** For all my other responsibilities, I am still lord commander of the Temple Knights, and I would not soon yield this duty to another.

**AYMERIC:** The esteemed Ser Aymeric, leading the Temple Knights and the watch into battle, along with my youngest. I could wish for no more.

**SYSTEM:** Then you wish for too little, my lord! There is another who might yet join the fray. An indispensable ally to whom we owe much and more. An adventurer beholden to none, who nevertheless chose to champion our cause. Who has shared in our suffering, and in our glory. A warrior without equal, whom I am privileged to call a friend. There is no one I would rather have fighting by my side. I ask this in full knowledge of your obligations, and will not think less of you should you refuse. But if your conscience will allow it, might you oblige me, my friend? One more time? Ha! Together, we shall give the people a spectacle for the ages─a celebration to mark the dawning of a new era! Let all here present heed well the rules of engagement!

**AYMERIC:** The grand melee is a large-scale battle in which an allied company of Ul'dahn, Gridanian, and Lominsan forces will be pitted against a company of Ishgardian forces. When a combatant is incapacitated, the opposing company will be awarded tactical points. The first company to attain the designated tactical rating of 100 points is declared the victor. During the grand melee, officiants may mark certain combatants with the Fury's Gaze, which will be indicated by an aetherial tether linking them to their company's flag. While defeating most combatants will award your company 1 tactical point, defeating marked combatants will award your company 10 tactical points. Marked combatants also possess enhanced attributes, rendering them more powerful and more difficult to defeat. Defending and defeating these combatants is the key to victory!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** For the honor and the glory of Ishgard!

**EMMANELLAIN:** All is ready, then. Very well. Brave men and women of the Eorzean Alliance. Let the grand melee begin!

**AYMERIC:** Did...did she win? Then we...we...

**EMMANELLAIN:** Victory is ours! Ishgard! Ishgard! Well fought! Well fought, my friend! You truly are the warrior of warriors! Thank the Fury you were on our side!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Hah hah...my lungs are burning, and I can barely stand! I didn't think I could do it...but then I did! We did! We faced the Alliance's best, and together, with one heart, with one purpose, we prevailed! After a thousand years of hardship, of strife and bloodshed, we are strong enough to rise to any challenge─be it on the battlefield or beyond. The future holds so much promise. So much joy. We need only show them the way.

**AYMERIC:** A truly magnificent display, ser knight. While doubtless less than pleased, I am quite sure the Grand Companies are *honored* to have been bested by such valiant warriors.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** The honor was ours, Your Grace.

**AYMERIC:** I am pleased to see that Ishgard's proud martial tradition is being upheld. When the time comes, I trust you will fight alongside your brothers and sisters in the Eorzean Alliance with the same fervor you displayed in opposing them. I note that our friend elected to take the field in Ishgardian colors.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** At my behest, Your Grace. If we have given offense, the blame lies with me.

**AYMERIC:** Fear not, ser knight. It was a surprise, nothing more. And any hint of ill-feeling was thoroughly dispelled by the spectacle of our mutual friend's duel with General Raubahn. On the subject of surprises, I could not help but marvel at the passion and unity of purpose displayed by your countrymen...given the troubling reports we have received of late.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I shall take that as a compliment, Your Grace. The events to which you allude are the price of change. The end of the Dragonsong War marks the beginning of a new era for our nation─and for the *people*, high- and lowborn alike, who will lead her into the future.

**THANCRED:** Ah, yes... The people. Change is indeed a perilous thing, for we who seek it and they who fear it. I shall pray for Ishgard─and for you.

**HONOROIT:** Well, that made for a refreshing change. Congratulations on your victory, by the way. The Ishgardians certainly seem happy with themselves. I, for my part, am merely glad you did not strain anything in the process of single-handedly winning the battle for them. <gasp> 'Tis but a scratch, I assure you. And I will not suffer you to worry over me─not when we have a dozen far more important concerns. ...Make that two dozen. Still, as Y'shtola never tires of telling me, we can but face them head-on, one at a time. One day at a time...as Minfilia would have done.

**EMMANELLAIN:** (-???-)My lord!

**HONOROIT:** Honoroit, my boy! Shouldn't you be in bed?

**EMMANELLAIN:** Thank you for your concern, my lord, but I have largely recovered from my ordeal, and I have naught but several scars to show for it. Which, I have been told, some women may find...appealing.

**HONOROIT:** I see! And to think I was worried sick over you!

**EMMANELLAIN:** I'm not sure I understand, my lord.

**HONOROIT:** Well, let's put that theory to the proof, shall we?

**ALPHINAUD:** M-M-My lord!?

**EDMONT:** 'Twould seem that a great many things have occurred in my absence. I thought I might begin to make amends by welcoming you in person.

**LUCIA:** The messengers spared not their chocobos to bring us word of your victory in the grand melee. I cannot well describe our elation when we heard the news. It called to mind the day we rejoined the Eorzean Alliance, when I glimpsed hope rekindled in the eyes of the people.

**AYMERIC:** The Fury Herself ushers us into a new era. Ser Aymeric, the time is now!

**LUCIA:** Aye, that it is. Reconvene the conference and summon Vidofnir to Falcon's Nest. We will make peace with Hraesvelgr's brood and hasten this bloody war to its end.

**EDMONT:** Yes, Lord Commander!

**THANCRED:** I will send word to Artoirel and bid him resume preparations. Emmanellain─you will place yourself at your brother's disposal. He will be glad of your assistance.

**AYMERIC:** No stopping it now, is there? We should inform Y'shtola and the others.

**LUCIA:** My dear friend...I doubt I will ever be able to thank you enough. But when the conference is successfully concluded, I damn well mean to try.

**AYMERIC:** The appointed hour approaches.

**LUCIA:** Aye.

**AYMERIC:** She begged leave to watch the proceedings. I saw no reason not to grant it.

**LUCIA:** Should I choose to deviate from my prepared remarks, I ask that you trust in my judgment.

**CITIZENA02240:** Have I ever done otherwise?

**CITIZENB02240:** Look!

**VIDOFNIR:** The white dragon!

**AYMERIC:** Ah, how long it hath been since our peoples met thus, children of Thordan. Even by our reckoning.

**VIDOFNIR:** Vidofnir, daughter of Hraesvelgr, we give thanks for your visit and bid you welcome to Falcon's Nest.

**AYMERIC:** Our sire bade us hearken unto the whispers of our hearts. They spoke to us of a paradise lost─of bonds of brotherhood which they yearn to see restored.

**VIDOFNIR:** Ours too yearn for such a restoration. And they have guided us here this day, that they might yearn no longer. Brothers and sisters, ye who stand as witness, hearken to me! Since the days of eld, when the bonds betwixt man and dragon were sundered by our hand, our peoples have known only war. Bloodshed without end, losses beyond counting─and still we fought. And still we fought. Some wounds do not heal. The dead cannot be returned to us. But we the living can yet choose another course. Here and now, we can lay down this burden─this hatred, this vengeance. Our forebears fought not so that we could die, but that we might live! So let us honor their sacrifice and spare our children this death sentence. Let us gift them a new legacy. Life!

**AYMERIC:** Betwixt our peoples yawneth a divide deeper than the deepest abyss; wider than the widest sea. Generations will live and die ere this divide is bridged. Knowing this, doth thy heart yet yearn for peace, son of Thordan?

**VIDOFNIR:** Look now on the legacy we would leave to our children. A dream of peace inscribed in stone for generations to come.

**ESTINIEN:** Father and his beloved. As they were so long ago. Happy and at peace. The dream they shared shall be ours once more.

**AYMERIC:** (-???-)Never!

**ALPHINAUD:** Your bow!

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien! No...

**ALPHINAUD:** Child of Dravania! Art thou grown so forgetful that thou wouldst forsake kith and kin, and consort with the spawn of Thordan? That thou wouldst *dare* contemplate peace! Hearken unto me, all of you! The final chorus is nigh, and all will be held to account! All will bathe in the flames of retribution! Till the coming of that day, look you on your sins and despair! For none shall 'scape my wrath! None shall 'scape my revenge!

**CITIZENA02240:** Seven hells! Damn you, Nidhogg...

**CITIZENB02240:** Hells take that wyrm! While he lives, we'll never know peace!

**CITIZENC02240:** Aye, there'll be no end to this war till Nidhogg is dead and gone!

**CITIZENA02240:** So let's kill the bastard and be done with it! Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!

**CITIZENB02240:** (-Angry Mob-)Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!

**CITIZENC02240:** (-Angry Mob-)Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!

**CITIZENA02240:** (-Angry Mob-)Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!

**CITIZENB02240:** (-Angry Mob-)Death to the wyrm! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to the wyrm! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to the wyrm! Death to Nidhogg!

**CITIZENC02240:** (-Angry Mob-)Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!

**KRILE:** (-Angry Mob-)Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!
Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!

**YSHTOLA:** Of all the ways for it to end. Even before his transformation, I could feel the wyrm's hatred swirling about Estinien. The terrible, all-consuming rage... Enough to fuel a thousand-year quest for vengeance. It was all I could do not to run away screaming. But Ishgardians─nay, all Eorzeans─are made of sterner stuff. They face danger and death on a daily basis, and understand what it takes to win a war.

**KRILE:** Think not too deeply on Master Matoya's words. Her intent was but to steel our resolve. That, and to remind us to look beyond these passing conflicts to trials greater still─to the truth which hides at the heart of this world.

**YSHTOLA:** So that's your aim, is it?

**KRILE:** You disapprove?

**ALPHINAUD:** Not at all! I believe it's traditional for the student to follow in the footsteps of the master. And you are so very alike.

**000:** Forgive me. That took longer than expected. ...You seem puzzled. Oh, these? I thought something warming might not go amiss. It was not all that long ago that we sat here, you and I. In our very own “Falling Snows,” as Lord Haurchefant called it. I still struggle to believe he has gone. And Ysayle too... I had such hopes for her... Master Matoya asked me what it was all for. Why we fight...and why we die. Were I still commander of the Braves, I would doubtless have replied, “For the future of Eorzea,” but I am not that man. Not anymore. I needed a new answer. One that I could live with. And when I saw Estinien at the ceremony, I knew at last what it was. I do not want to be a man who sacrifices his friends and family for a cause. I want to fight for Estinien─and I want to save him. When Nidhogg leads the Horde into battle, Ser Aymeric and his forces will do what they believe must be done. That is their choice to make. Yet even if Ser Aymeric is willing to forsake Estinien, I am not. We must fight for him, for he is our friend and ally. We may struggle, we may fail, but we must try.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? We will find a way to save him. ...To aid those in need. ...

**EDMONT:** We will. I know we will. Lord Haurchefant would be proud. I knew you would understand! Together, we will surely find a way. Forgive me. I say these things to you in full knowledge of the fact that you have never yet given up on a friend. We will find a way. I know we will.

**SYSTEM:** Change─that great, inexorable wave─was upon us, and soon all of Ishgard would bend to its will. For all our sins, for all our scars, the future for which we had long yearned was at last within our grasp. But it would be bought at a heavy price. For in those twilight hours did Nidhogg cry out for vengeance,
and his brethren raise their voices for the final chorus of the Dragonsong War.

**KRILE:** From the memoirs of Count Edmont de Fortemps
*Heavensward: The Gears of Change*



---------------------------------------------------------------------




---------------------------------------------------------------------

**KRILE:** We have kept you waiting overlong, I fear...

**TATARU:** Not to worry, Alphinaud. We had some rather fine mulled wine to keep us company. Truth be told, you could have delayed your arrival a few moments more...

**YSHTOLA:** Gibrillont got the spicing just right this time. His latest batch is not only delicious and warming, but *soothing to the humours*!

**KRILE:** Indeed. But 'twas not to soothe our humours that we gathered here.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, no─quite right. The matter of that poor dragoon...

**KRILE:** You have discovered something─a means to save him?

**YSHTOLA:** Let us not jump to conclusions, shall we? Assess the facts presented, then make an educated analysis, as you were taught.

**ALPHINAUD:** Pray cast your mind back to the moment of Estinien's transformation. Do you recall how you described it to us? You spoke of the sudden pangs which racked his body when he took up both of Nidhogg's eyes─and of how his form was twisted thereafter into a shadowy semblance of the great wyrm.

**YSHTOLA:** When he appeared at Falcon's Nest, the wyrm's eyes were fused to his mail.

**ALPHINAUD:** Would that only his armor had been corrupted... Snaking forth from the eyes, I descried dark tendrils which entangled his very being. His aether has been all but smothered.

**KRILE:** Then he is lost to us forever?

**ALPHINAUD:** What did I just say about jumping to conclusions!? Y'shtola clearly stated “all but smothered.” As I later discovered, her impression matched my own. Though Nidhogg's presence filled my mind's eye, beneath his seething aura, I sensed the merest hint of something else. And after listening to Y'shtola's observations, I became more certain of my suspicion: that the “something else” I had sensed was, in fact, the trace of a different will, submerged in the sea of Nidhogg's rage.

**YSHTOLA:** You mean...

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes. 'Tis like that Estinien's spirit yet lingers.

**YSHTOLA:** Can we not wrest him from Nidhogg's grasp, then!? Tear the eyes from the armor!?

**ALPHINAUD:** We know not if that would serve to separate wyrm's soul from man's. None have ever attempted such a feat.

**KRILE:** Should it offer even the faintest hope of success, then by the gods, I shall be the first to try.

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud... By all means, hold fast to your hope. But be mindful of the dangers. Even should you succeed in excising the eyes from the dragoon's mail, we have no way of knowing if your friend's soul would survive so violent a separation. And that is to say nothing of the possibility that his would-be savior might become Nidhogg's next host.

**HONOROIT:** But what other choice remains to us? Should the opportunity present itself, I will tear those foul orbs from Estinien's armor and trust in the resilience of his soul─even at the risk of mine own!

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah! I've found you at last! A messenger of the Temple Knights came to the manor some few hours past. The lord commander humbly requests the company of the Warrior of Light and Master Alphinaud.

**YSHTOLA:** Ser Aymeric would speak with us? Very well. Thank you, Honoroit.

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Twould seem duty calls. Pray see to yours, and we shall return to ours.

**KRILE:** Thank you, Y'shtola, Krile. Your words have given me hope where there was none. Come then. Ser Aymeric awaits.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Alphinaud is allowing his feelings for this dragoon to cloud his thoughts. I worry he may do something rash. Keep an eye on him, would you?

**EDMONT:** They think more of their friend's deliverance than their foe's defeat... But will history commend their fealty or condemn their folly?

**AYMERIC:** The conference held at Falcon's Nest was to be a celebration of the reconciliation 'twixt man and dragon. But the lingering shade of Nidhogg, clad in the flesh of the Azure Dragoon,
did mark the occasion by spilling the blood of his own kind. A timely atrocity to remind the children of Ishgard that the Dragonsong War was far from over... And when fear gave way to fury, the call to arms rang out anew: “Death to Nidhogg! Death to Nidhogg!”

**ALPHINAUD:** My friends, I thank you for coming.

**AYMERIC:** You have had news of Nidhogg?

**LUCIA:** Alas, not. Our scouts range far and wide, but they have as yet found no trace of the great wyrm.

**ALPHINAUD:** We dispatched an elite unit of dragoons to reconnoiter the Churning Mists, but even they returned empty-handed.

**AYMERIC:** A pity...

**ALPHINAUD:** Fear not, Alphinaud─we shall see the wyrm again soon enough. His words at Falcon's Nest attest to that. Indeed, he is like to come sooner than we would wish.

**AYMERIC:** I assume Ishgard's defenses are being bolstered as we speak?

**ALPHINAUD:** With all haste. I mean to call upon every able-bodied warrior at our disposal, from the knights of the four houses to the men and women of the watch. But I did not summon you to discuss strategy.

**AYMERIC:** What then would you have of us, my lord?

**ALPHINAUD:** I will speak plain: now that Nidhogg is possessed of both of his eyes, no mortal force we can muster will repel him. That being the case, we must needs recruit an ally of equal strength...

**AYMERIC:** You speak of Hraesvelgr!?

**ALPHINAUD:** I do. To whom else could we turn?

**AYMERIC:** That he is Nidhogg's equal I do not deny. Nor can I name another. But convincing the reclusive creature to do battle with his own brood-brother will be... How shall I put this?

**ALPHINAUD:** It will be no small undertaking, yes. Estinien's report was most particular about Hraesvelgr's unwillingness to involve himself in the affairs of men. But much has changed since your visit to Sohm Al, and if there is even a chance that the dragon may be swayed, I *must* plead our case. Whatever price the dragon asks of me, I shall pay it─such was my oath to defend the people of Ishgard. Come what may, my friends, the battle with Nidhogg will mark the end of my tenure as the acting head of church and state. Will you help me discharge this final duty?

**AYMERIC:** We will, my lord─though I fear our involvement offers no guarantee of success. Come, then─we will depart at your leisure.

**LUCIA:** Thank you. Both of you. The city is yours, First Commander.

**HRAESVELGR:** My lord. We shall pray for your swift return.

**ALPHINAUD:** You dare summon me again, mortals?

**AYMERIC:** Great Hraesvelgr, 'tis not lightly that we beg this audience. Pray hearken to our words, for they concern the future of man and dragon both.

**HRAESVELGR:** Greetings, Hraesvelgr. I am Aymeric de Borel, acting ruler of the nation of Ishgard. I am come before you to parley on behalf of my people.

**AYMERIC:** ...To *parley*? Thinkest thou thy purpose unclear to me? Thou art come to beg mine aid in the battle against the shade of my brood-brother.

**HRAESVELGR:** You...foresaw mine intent.

**ALPHINAUD:** I but read that which is writ plain in thine eyes. Would that thou had wit enough to scry the answer in mine. My beloved Shiva did once build a bridge 'twixt man and dragon─a bridge which thy treacherous forefathers saw fit to tear down, as thou well knowest. Thinkest thou Nidhogg was alone in despairing at the murder of our brood-sister? Thinkest thou mine own soul did not cry out for vengeance? Know then that upon that accursed day, my heart did wither in my breast, and thy kind become unto me the harbingers of despair. 'Tis only Shiva's gentle dream that preventeth me from flying at Nidhogg's shoulder. Be grateful that I swore to abjure aggression ere I consumed her. I permit my children to offer or deny thee aid as they see fit; to warn thy people of my brood-brother's coming. That thou wouldst dare ask more of me but affirmeth thine incurable arrogance.

**HRAESVELGR:** We understand that in your despair at man's betrayal, you seek only the refuge of solitude. But despite your protestations of spent faith, do you not still nurture the smallest flame of hope?

**ALPHINAUD:** Perceivest thou such light in the dusk of mine existence?

**HRAESVELGR:** I do. If you claim I see falsely, then tell me: why did you consent to bear Ysayle upon your back?

**ALPHINAUD:** Ysayle... Piteous, deluded Ysayle. The child did lament her past sins, and sought to balance the scales with her remaining days. 'Twas her unquenchable passion, so alike to that of my beloved, which did spur me into flight. And for mine own part, I would countenance no longer the hands of evil men to use my brood-brother's eye for ill.

**HRAESVELGR:** So you do distinguish between those who acknowledge and repent their sins, and those who perpetuate them. Interesting. It seems to me that you have not, in fact, lost faith in mankind as a whole. Rather, you weigh our respective merits by how we allow the past to influence our future.

**AYMERIC:** Spare me thine idle sophistry. Even were there a mote of truth in thy reasoning, what of it? Wouldst thou have me slay mine own sibling to save a city of mortals?

**HRAESVELGR:** Should we suffer ties of blood to bind our hands then? Nay. If the crime is one of unconscionable evil, we must needs condemn it─even should the transgressor be our closest kin. When my father corrupted himself and his followers with the power of a primal, I beseeched the Warrior of Light to slay him─an act alike to patricide. That he did not die by my hand matters little─if anything, it heaps greater disgrace upon my name. But had my father not fallen, he would have drawn countless thousands into a holy war of hellish proportions─which I hold the greater crime. Thus did I order his execution, sparing the lives of my people and yours. Alas, your brother wyrm now prepares to murder those whom I sought to spare. What is more, he has taken my comrade's body for his own─but if I must slay my dearest friend to defeat my direst foe, I will not flinch from my duty!

**MIDGARDSORMR:** Thou wouldst strike down thy friend and, by example of thy righteousness, persuade me to break mine oath and kill my kindred?

**000:** Heed me, my child. The servants of Hydaelyn envision a different outcome. They intend salvation not only for Ishgard, but for the doomed dragonslayer as well. Believest thou this shade to be Nidhogg returned? Is it not merely a manifestation of his vengeance─the shadow cast by thy brood-brother's rage? I would not command thee, but ponder well thy course lest it lead thee unto greater remorse...

**HRAESVELGR:** What will you say? While this shade of vengeance remains, the future will ever be uncertain. Help us save our companion. ...

**ALPHINAUD:** Nidhogg's transformation into rage incarnate is, in part, of mine own doing. I rendered unto him mine eye, and empowered his revenge thereby... But 'tis the purity of my brood-brother's wrath that lendeth him his all-surpassing might. Thou wishest to rescue the dragoon from his fate along with all the rest? I do begin to see why Ysayle entrusted her hope unto thee. Thy purpose is pure. ...But so too is my brood-brother's wrath, and 'tis that which lendeth him his all-surpassing might. What, no words for me, warrior? I take it thou art resolved to act whether I aid thee or no... Ha! I do admire thy determination. Hast thou the strength of will to stand against so terrible a shadow, I wonder? 'Twould seem I must put thee and thy companions to the proof. I shall await thee in the ruins wherein Ratatoskr once dwelled. Heed well the words of my children, and hasten thee to the place of thy trial! Even bereft of an eye, my brood-brother was a fearsome foe indeed. But having tasted thy strength firsthand, full well can I imagine how thou didst bring him low. The dread title of “Azure Dragoon” is no empty appellation. But having tasted thy strength firsthand, I do begin to see how thou didst bring him low. Hydaelyn chooseth Her servants well. Very well. I shall trust in the seed of man one last time. By thy deeds shall the flickering hope that lingereth yet within my heart be kindled anew...or extinguished forever.

**ALPHINAUD:** That you yet stand is ready proof of your determination, mortals. Let us fight as allies, then, and together banish my brood-brother's vengeful shade. On my oath, the wrath that once was Nidhogg shall meet its end! This I swear on the memory of my beloved Shiva, and on the soul of lost Ysayle...

**AYMERIC:** Our negotiations proved rather more strenuous than I had anticipated, but the results seem well worth the effort.

**ALPHINAUD:** The battle was indeed hard-won. Thank you, my friends─I would never have earned Hraesvelgr's cooperation had you not seen fit to grant me yours. 'Twas your stalwart heroism that moved the heart of the great wyrm at the last. Any gratitude I can offer is but poor reward for your continued service to Ishgard.

**MIDGARDSORMR:** 'Twould seem our final reckoning with the dread wyrm is at hand. I only wish we had some inkling as to when he means to strike. Oh gods!

**AYMERIC:** The cry heraldeth his coming. Nidhogg's shade hath taken wing.

**HRAESVELGR:** It has begun. We must away to Ishgard!

**AYMERIC:** Know you, then, what this roar portendeth?

**HRAESVELGR:** Aye. I must return to my city without delay.

**LUCIA:** Then we shall lend you our wings. Let us meet with Nidhogg on the field of battle, and together bring an end to his wrathful song.

**ARTOIREL:** Remember your training! We hold fast until the lord commander returns! Ugh... We must hold...

**LUCIA:** Reinforcements!
By the Fury... That one is the size of Nidhogg!

**ARTOIREL:** Lord Commander!

**NIDHOGG:** You are late, Warrior of Light!

**HRAESVELGR:** Wherefore standest thou with these vermin, Brother?

**NIDHOGG:** Abandon this war, shade. The suffering thou sowest serveth no end. The traitors' progeny have learned of their forefathers' betrayal, and seek now to make amends with our kind. Never shall our grief be assuaged nor our loss forgotten, but reconciliation may yet halt the spread of this plague of enmity. Forsake thy vengeance and be at peace.

**HRAESVELGR:** What soft-headed ramblings are these? Thy dalliance with that vile maid hath robbed thee of thy wits! Mayhap her cloying perfume hath made thee forget the stench of our brood-sister's lifeblood!

**NIDHOGG:** Thou darest speak thus of my beloved!?

**HRAESVELGR:** Ah! So the flames of rage may yet be kindled! I feared thy heart's fire had long since gone out. But waste not thy fury on words, Brother─thou shalt have need of it for the battle!

**NIDHOGG:** Guh!

**HRAESVELGR:** Thou art weak, Hraesvelgr─a slithering wyrm who fawneth on the vermin who should rightly be his prey. For a thousand years have I fought without cease─and thou didst think to prevail against me!

**NIDHOGG:** Glory not in thy victory, shade. The battle...is not yet won. My power─and my hope─have I entrusted to another...

**ESTINIEN:** Thine eye! What hast thou done!? Fool! Thou wouldst trust a mortal with thy strength!? I know thee... 'Twas thou who didst intrude upon my lair and best the half of me. But now I am whole, and naught in creation shall deny me my vengeance!

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Nidhogg-)Is this...to be...mine end? (-Nidhogg-)Nay... I will not allow it... I am of the first brood... I am vengeance incarnate... I am Nidhogg! (-Nidhogg-)Thou shalt die by my hand! This is not your hand, wyrm! (-Nidhogg-)Thou...wilt...obey! I would ask one last favor of you, Warrior of Light... Finish me─now, while I have the beast subdued! (-Nidhogg-)Gaaahhh!

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien! Augh! Aaaaaahhh!

**ALPHINAUD:** You waste your time. Kill me! It is the only way! Ending Nidhogg...will be my final duty...

**NIDHOGG:** No! You can't die like this! I won't let you! Augh! Aaaaaahhh! Aaaaaahhh!

**AYMERIC:** Undone by mortal will. Whither now...?

**LUCIA:** The eyes! Cast them into the abyss! He lives. Ah, Estinien, my ill-fated friend... Lucia! Summon the healers! I want them ready to receive him!

**AYMERIC:** At once, Lord Commander!

**HRAESVELGR:** Allow me to do this much, at least...

**AYMERIC:** The Horde have sensed the fall of their master, and scattered to the winds.

**HRAESVELGR:** You have my gratitude, Hraesvelgr. Your deeds this day have saved a great many lives.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then our alliance hath served its purpose. Thou didst wield the power I granted thee well. 'Twas thine own skill and not mine eye which earned thee victory. I wish thy companion a swift recovery. Fare you well, children of man.

**EDMONT:** The battle is won. We can do no more for Estinien now than bear him home and wish him well, even as Hraesvelgr did. The rest we must trust to the hands of the healers and the grace of the gods.

**ALPHINAUD:** The heroes of the hour return!

**ARTOIREL:** We but did our duty, my lord. It was the memories of fallen friends and not our heroism which saw us through at the last.

**EMMANELLAIN:** I gave every onze of my strength, but mine efforts would have counted for naught had the Warrior of Light not arrived to challenge the great wyrm. As a sworn knight of Ishgard, I had hoped to do more for my city...

**HONOROIT:** Well, we cannot *all* be heroes, dear brother. Let us put away our pride for a moment, and revel in the valiant deeds of our comrade! For your sterling service to Ishgard, we salute you! And while we're on the subject of valiant deeds, I believe I myself have earned some small measure of recognition: under my watchful command, the ballistas of the outer ward struck down a veritable swarm of Dravanian invaders.

**EDMONT:** My lord's command was certainly watchful. He bravely watched as the siege crews took aim, and continued to watch as countless wyverns met their end. Indeed, the ward's defenders proved so well drilled that my lord had little occasion to *stop* watching.

**ALPHINAUD:** There will be time enough to determine who is most deserving of recognition later. Our friends are doubtless weary from their exertions. I had chambers prepared in expectation of your return. You are welcome to retire at your leisure.

**EDMONT:** I am most grateful for your hospitality, my lord, but I believe I shall pay a visit to the Temple Knights' infirmary. Pray excuse me.

**ALPHINAUD:** How Master Alphinaud has grown. The plight of his stricken brother-in-arms pains him more than his own hurts. ...In which respect, he has come to resemble you, Warrior of Light. Go then─visit the Azure Dragoon, and grant him what comfort you may.

**ESTINIEN:** Oh... Estinien...

**ALPHINAUD:** Cease your mewling, boy. It grates my ears.

**AYMERIC:** Forgive me. When I saw you awaken, I could not─ It was such a relief! We feared you might never wake up!

**ESTINIEN:** Now, now, Estinien. If Master Alphinaud thought any less of you, you would still be Nidhogg's plaything─*or dead*.

**AYMERIC:** Aye, aye. 'Twas but a jest. I thank you, Alphinaud...and you too, Warrior of Light. Quite how you managed to persuade Hraesvelgr to aid in his brood-brother's downfall, I cannot imagine─but full glad am I that you did. 'Tis an honor to share the mantle of Azure Dragoon with one such as you. I thank you, Alphinaud...and you too, Warrior of Light. Quite how you managed to persuade Hraesvelgr to aid in his brood-brother's downfall, I cannot imagine─but full glad am I that you did. Yet again, you have achieved the impossible.

**ESTINIEN:** I, for my part, owe you an apology. When last we met, I did willingly loose an arrow at your heart. Can you forgive me?

**ALPHINAUD:** There is naught to forgive, Aymeric. You but acted in defense of Ishgard, as is your duty. Were you any less single-minded about it, I would not follow you into battle─nor trust you at my back. Besides, I had come to the selfsame conclusion─that I would have to perish for Nidhogg to be stopped. So let us dispense with the hand-wringing. I have heard enough mewling for one day.

**ESTINIEN:** Oh!

**AYMERIC:** The tendrils of Nidhogg's foul presence bound up every fiber of my being, usurping my senses, but I yet retained some trace of awareness. The wyrm's mind was as a vast and tumultuous sea. Endlessly its black waters churned, his grief and despair at Ratatoskr's murder never calming, never receding. And driven by this surging current came wave upon wave of unrelenting rancor. It was the very image of my own heart. There I saw the dark reflection of the hatred I felt after Nidhogg slew my family, when no path remained save vengeance against dragonkind. Neither one of us had a choice. But I was blessed with something Nidhogg was not─comrades and teachers to console and admonish me. Had I not had them to gainsay my obsession, it would surely have consumed me, as Nidhogg's did him, and we would have been in all respects alike. Though his shade is banished, his spirit scattered upon the Sea of Clouds, I feel no joy at his passing. Where once I craved vengeance, I now crave rest. Lord Commander, my hunt is at an end. I would lay down the mantle of Azure Dragoon.

**ABEL:** My friend...

**AYMERIC:** He has tired himself with too many words. I doubt not that he will make a full recovery, but he must be allowed some few days of quiet.

**EDMONT:** I too must see my path to its end. Sleep well, my friend.

**SYSTEM:** Following the battle with Nidhogg on the Steps of Faith,
Ser Aymeric called an assembly that he might make his final proclamation as acting head of state. 'Twas there, with one decree, that the thousand-year rule of the archbishops was ended, paving the way for a new republic. The governance of Ishgard would now be placed in the hands of high- and lowborn alike,
their ranks represented by the newly founded House of Lords and House of Commons. Church was separated from state. The foundation for change had been carefully laid,
and the reforms proposed by Ishgard's new government passed into law without incident. His duty done, Aymeric de Borel gladly stepped down from the archbishop's dais...
only to be raised unto the highest seat in the House of Lords. Though he strove at first to refuse this honor,
the unexpectedly strident voice of the Count de Durendaire left him little choice but to accept... And so it was that the winds of gentle revolution came to stir. Prominent among the many honored guests at Ser Aymeric's investiture were the ambassadors of dragonkind,
a fitting symbol of Ishgard's newfound peace. The people looked on in awe as he soared through the heavens on dragonback,
and by their cheers did they hail him an Azure Dragoon for a new age. Thus were the notes of the Dragonsong rewritten, the din of war giving way to a rising litany of peace and hope.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**000:** To think the moogles would prove such harsh taskmasters! Forgive me, I did not know you had suffered so in your quest for the horn. I must say, your spirited accounts always come as a welcome change from the arid reports which fill my days. Though I have lived in these lands my entire life, to hear you speak of them, there is much and more I have yet to see. Truly, yours was a marvelous journey.

**AYMERIC:** What will you say? Though perhaps a bit long for my liking. Why not join me on the next? It wasn't all sunshine and lemoncakes.

**MESSENGER02341:** Long *and* arduous, aye. Not unlike the journey that Ishgard has at last embarked upon─thanks to the efforts of you and yours. Hah! Well...truth be told, when I think back on the sweeping vistas of the Churning Mists, I do feel some slight pangs of wanderlust... Alas, much as I would like to accept your invitation, I fear my present duties with the House of Lords demand my undivided attention. Someday, perhaps. Nor would I presume to imply otherwise. Neither I nor any man alive can truly understand what you have endured, and I cannot say with any confidence that I would have acquitted myself as well under the circumstances─much less grown stronger for it. By your deeds, you have helped us to lay the foundation for lasting reform. The formation of the republic is but the beginning, for it is not only our system of governance which must needs change. We the people must learn to let go of our hatreds and rise above our bloody past. I only pray that I live long enough to see us achieve some measure of success─that I might know the lost did not die in vain. I can still see you there, on the Steps of Faith, striding fearlessly towards the wyrm... If you could do that, who are we to balk at the challenges ahead? The question of how best to strengthen ties with the other great nations of Eorzea has been debated at length in the Lords and Commons of late. As you may imagine, maintaining stability during this period of historic upheaval is our paramount concern. Nevertheless, we are greatly indebted to the Alliance for their support during the grand melee, and it would be remiss of us not to repay their faith in kind. Of course, we owe you the greatest debt of all, and it is my hope that in extending our support to you and the Scions, we might also express our gratitude to our neighbors─nay, our fellow Eorzeans, whom we pray you will continue to protect. The Lords and Commons agree on very little, but not a soul in either house begrudges your order this offer of patronage. For all you have done and will do, we thank you. ...May I ask a personal question? Now that the dust has settled, what will you do? Not as a Scion, I mean, but...what do you want for yourself?

**AYMERIC:** Lord Commander, pray forgive the interruption!

**MESSENGER02341:** News from House Fortemps?

**AYMERIC:** An urgent message for the Warrior of Light. I was instructed to deliver it without delay. Master Thancred returned to the manor a short time ago, bearing an injured maiden. Master Leveilleur and Mistress Tataru are tending to her wounds, but they like not her chances. Respectfully, my lord─they have requested the Warrior of Light's immediate presence.

**PAPALYMO:** You must go to them, my friend. And I shall go with you.

**ALISAIE:** For every ending marks a new beginning. From tragedy and sacrifice we rise to greet a new dawn. As did she. Only to be drawn unto another battlefield, another cause, as if by fate...

**AYMERIC:** Th...As─ Ugh... <gasp>

**THANCRED:** Is that...?

**ALPHINAUD:** Alisaie, Alphinaud's twin sister. She ran afoul of the Warriors of Darkness. I had been tracking them since the ceremony at Falcon's Nest. Little did I know I was not the only one. Evidently she had learned of their activities and attempted to shadow them on her own. Poorly. I rescued her in the Twelveswood, and together we fled north. But though I made every effort to cover our tracks, they caught up with us on the Ishgardian border, and in the ensuing struggle, Alisaie took an arrow to the shoulder.
'Twas only after we had made good our escape that I realized it was poisoned...

**AYMERIC:** Thank you for coming so quickly. And you, Ser Aymeric.

**ALPHINAUD:** Think nothing of it. How is she?

**AYMERIC:** We have done all we can for now. Although the immediate danger has passed, the poison yet lingers in her blood... We came to Eorzea together, hoping to bring salvation to the realm our grandfather gave his life to protect. But when confronted with the bitter realities of its politics and its petty powermongers, she was driven to anger─and to doubt. She refused to become embroiled in what she termed Eorzea's “squabbles,” and distanced herself from the Scions. Though she remained hopeful of a brighter future, she would walk her own path. Would that it had not been so perilous... For all our differences, she is as dedicated as any Scion to the salvation of Eorzea. But more than that, she is my sister... To be reunited with her, only to lose her forever... Gods, even to speak the words...

**ALISAIE:** Take heart, Master Alphinaud. She will be attended by our most skilled chirurgeons. Bear Mistress Leveilleur to the infirmary at once. Apprise Captain Whitecape of the situation, and inform him that she is to be treated as my personal charge.

**TATARU:** W-Wait... D-Don't go... Please, come closer... Alphinaud... Is the Warrior of Light... Is she with you? D-Don't go...there is something I must say... The Warriors of Darkness are in league with the Ascians... Slaughtering the primals is but the first step in their plan... They make for Xelphatol to bring about Garuda's summoning... And to kill her... You must... You must stop them...

**AYMERIC:** I...I shall inform the others at once!

**THANCRED:** Master Thancred─I would ask that you accompany Mistress Leveilleur to the infirmary. Your knowledge of her injuries may well prove useful in determining her treatment.

**ALPHINAUD:** Of course.

**PALADINOFDARKNESS:** So they were unable to see the ritual to its completion... Then Garuda is no longer a threat, and whatever the Ascians and the Warriors of Darkness were planning has come to naught... But we should not tarry. The knights have secured our path to safety.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Well, well... What do we have here? You'd better not have killed the primal without us!

**BARDOFDARKNESS:** *You*!

**PALADINOFDARKNESS:** Wait, I know you! Still walking, I see. I could have *sworn* my aim was true...

**WHITEMAGEOFDARKNESS:** Just what is your game? Leading us the long way, so these fools could step in and claim our prize?

**ALPHINAUD:** Now, now. Let's not make hasty accusations. By the look of things, the ritual was proceeding as planned. We arrived at the appointed hour. 'Twas they who erred.

**BARDOFDARKNESS:** It is hopeless. We cannot face them all...

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Do mine ears deceive? A *boy*! So *that's* the way of it. Twins! You had me worried for a moment there. Know that I will happily make it quicker for you...if you just stand still.

**ALPHINAUD:** Enough, J'rhoomale. We wouldn't want to upset the man in white with any unnecessary bloodshed, now would we? You've been awfully busy since we were kind enough to spare your lives.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** While you were *idly* consorting with the Ascians, you mean? Seven hells! What could you possibly hope to achieve!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Should I explain it to you? Very well. Consider it a reward of sorts for beating us here. You know the tale of Hydaelyn and Zodiark, I take it. Of the great sundering, and the reflections it created?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Across ten and three they were divided. Reflections of the Source, each possessed of shards of Light and Dark...

**ALPHINAUD:** Just so. One of those reflections─the one nearest to the Source─is our home. And we were the heroes blessed with Her Light. But not all worlds hold Light and Dark in equal measure. In ours, the power of Light was greater by far. So the Ascians who once threatened our home were no match, and they fell before us, one after another, till none were left. Victory, we thought... ...And then came the Light─a flood of pure, blinding radiance, annihilating shadow and color and *life itself*. Ere long, it will consume our world, leaving naught in its wake but blank perfection.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** That─ That cannot be! Do you honestly expect us to believe such a story!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Believe what you like. But it has happened before, on a world far removed from ours. The Thirteenth, which was swallowed by the Dark, and transformed into what you call the void. Unchallenged Light would condemn us to a similar fate. And so we joined hands with our former enemies, and with their aid came here...to the Source. For there is but one way to restore the balance and save our home: the Ardor. Calamitous destruction with the power to break down the barriers between planes, and see our worlds rejoined.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** You would doom our world to save your own!? What would even become of us? Of you?

**ALPHINAUD:** Enough. I tire of talking. You know our cause. You know what is at stake. We are prepared to do whatever it takes! Are you?

**ALISAIE:** If there is aught you would say, say it. Otherwise, begone. You have no friends here. Alisaie! How are you feeling?

**YSHTOLA:** Well enough, Brother, thanks to the kindness of our hosts. They told me you had departed for Xelphatol while I was still abed. I slept much better knowing that. Thank you. When they told me you had departed for Xelphatol, I found that I could rest. The outcome seemed a mere formality, as did your safe return. Thank you, my friend.

**THANCRED:** I take it your mission was a success?

**ALPHINAUD:** ...As if we needed any further confirmation that they are in league with the Ascians. ...But to *save another world*? I think not.

**YSHTOLA:** I too thought his story fanciful at first. But it is possible there may be a kernel of truth in all of this. At the very least, none of his claims contradict the Word's account.

**ALISAIE:** You were following these people, Alisaie. Why?

**ALPHINAUD:** During my travels, I had oft enjoyed tales of the Scions and their exploits. But after a time, I began to hear whispers of a gifted, and theretofore unknown, band of adventurers. Adventurers who had supposedly sworn to travel the realm slaying primals in the Scions' stead.

**ALISAIE:** The Warriors of Darkness... And in the course of investigating these rumors, you stumbled upon the Ascians' involvement.

**AYMERIC:** Yes. Exactly.

**ALISAIE:** Forgive me, but if these Warriors of Darkness mean to bring about another Calamity, to what end do they hunt primals?

**AYMERIC:** To prompt an escalation. To deepen the beast tribes' feelings of helplessness and despair, and thereby drive them to summon ever more powerful gods. And lest we forget, these events do not occur in isolation. With their patron deities being slain left and right, the news of man's victory over Nidhogg must surely have sown panic in the minds of the beastmen. 'Tis no wonder they wish to defend themselves.

**ALISAIE:** Power answered with greater power, death with more death. A vicious cycle fueled by fear and hatred. I know its like all too well.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed. The Ascians sow discord and desperation, and the Warriors of Darkness reap the harvest. And so it continues. Yet that is not the extent of their ambitions. The Ascian himself observed that once the powerless realize that the old gods have failed them, they will have little recourse but to look to a new one.

**THANCRED:** ...We cannot let that happen.

**YSHTOLA:** It should come as no surprise, but Alisaie and I have uncovered evidence that the Ascians have been manipulating certain parties to ensure that a constant stream of crystals flows into the hands of the beast tribes. If we sever these supply lines, we should at least be able to slow the escalation.

**AYMERIC:** Agreed. Krile and I shall journey to Xelphatol and learn what we can of the Ixal's source.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hm. Then I, for my part, pledge to lead a similar investigation into the origin of the Gnath's supply.

**AYMERIC:** Ser Aymeric?

**THANCRED:** As a member of the Eorzean Alliance, Ishgard is honor-bound to play an active role in maintaining the security of the realm. You might also say that I have some personal motivation, given the Ascians' dealings with my father. However, I make no secret of the fact that my knowledge of primal beings is scant at best. As such, I should be most grateful if one of your order were to assist me.

**ALPHINAUD:** Allow me, Ser Aymeric. I have dealt with the Gnath before.

**ALISAIE:** Let us consult with Urianger, then. Given his dedication to the study of primal beings, I should be surprised if he could not tell us something of value.

**ALPHINAUD:** Allow me to accompany you, Brother. And before you think to refuse, know that I am not the girl I once was. I shall not be a burden─you have my word.

**TATARU:** But Alisaie, you... ...You are more than welcome. After all, it was you who set us upon this path.

**ALISAIE:** Wait a minute! I'm afraid I can't allow you to leave just yet─not until you try on the new outfit I prepared for you!

**000:** Who goes there? Oh, it's you. Forgive me for straying from the camp. He hasn't been feeling too welcome, to say the least. I thought a change of scenery might do him good, but, alas... It's so quiet out here. The stars spread out before us, beckoning across time and space... "Dawn may banish even the darkest night.“ How bitterly beautiful, those words. I should be stronger for all my experiences, yet my heart aches more than ever. I never understood why Grandfather gave his life that day. I thought that, if I came here, I would find the answers I needed. But when I finally laid eyes on the land he sacrificed everything to save, saw firsthand the bickering, the pettiness... I was disappointed. I was *angry*. I could not fathom how these people were more deserving of his love than his family...than me... Nevertheless, I had to believe he had good reason. I was determined to uncover the whole truth of the Calamity, and perhaps in so doing find my own purpose in this sea of chaos. But when Grandfather revealed the whole truth of the Calamity to us, I finally understood. And I resolved there and then to continue his legacy in my own way. My travels have been enlightening, but I cannot say that I have enjoyed them. I have lost count of the many petty crises that I was helpless to resolve, and of the people whose actions I could not understand. There were others, of course. Good people. People with whom I felt a kinship...whose lives I could not save. I found myself asking what it was all for. Why try if I was doomed to fail in the end? But then I recalled Grandfather's words to my father, years ago, before he left Sharlayan behind forever. "To ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom─it is indolence. We must all protect that which we hold most dear in the manner of our own choosing.“ ...We have to try, do we not? Of course, it's one thing to try and another to do. There were times while I was tracking the Warriors of Darkness when I faltered─when I was afraid. But then I thought of my brother, of Urianger... Of course, it's one thing to try and another to do. There were times while I was tracking the Warriors of Darkness when I faltered─when I was afraid. But then I thought of my brother, of Urianger, of you... Ah, pray forgive me. This conversation has been rather one-sided, hasn't it. Mayhap you could recount some of your adventures in Ishgard?

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? I traveled far and wide with two companions, Estinien and Ysayle, who were very... Under some rather unique circumstances, I had the pleasure to fight alongside Ser Aymeric... When Alphinaud and I came at last to the Dravanian hinterlands...

**URIANGER:** Gods, they must have been at each other's throats from dawn till dusk... I daresay you managed to keep the peace, though. Merely being in the presence of the Warrior of Light is surely enough to shame *anyone* into behaving. He is quite a man, the lord commander. I shall have to thank him for his kindness. Truth be told, I was rather taken aback by it all. Given Ishgard's famous love of foreigners, I was half expecting the chirurgeons to berate me for bleeding. But I never heard an unkind word. Everyone there seemed relatively open and friendly, in fact─thanks in no small part to your tireless efforts, I suspect. We had no clear memories of our life in the hinterlands, having returned to the motherland as infants. Nevertheless, I am quite familiar with Master Matoya, as is every Sharlayan. I should like to speak with her someday. 'Twould not surprise me if Alphinaud's recent maturation was at least somewhat due to her sage guidance. I would never tell him this, of course, but there have been moments when I've caught myself thinking of him as an *elder brother*... The hopes and dreams of so many rest on your shoulders, Warrior of Light. As long as the sun rises, we can but carry on. For the sake of those we hold dear.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** To what end dost thou cling to the tainted gifts of the Mother?

**URIANGER:** Every tool has its purpose. Even this. Well, what is it?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** The seeds sown in Vylbrand have been plucked from the earth and left to wither. Alas, Titan's demise sufficed not to drive the kobolds to deepest desperation.

**URIANGER:** What did the man in white have to say?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** That we are to proceed as he did first set forth.

**URIANGER:** Well that's easy for him to say! It's not *his* bloody world on the brink of destruction, is it!?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Be thou well reminded that with an end to Ishgard's unrest, naught now remaineth to preoccupy the Scions' thoughts. And thus may they devote their every energy to thwarting thee and thine. I foresee only greater difficulties ahead.

**URIANGER:** Foresee? Are you sure you don't *welcome them*? I'm starting to think you might hold a candle for your old friends, after all...

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Pray do not mistake mine intent. I but look upon the path which lieth before us with due trepidation. Shouldst thou be of like mind, pray consider, then, another course, for the power to invoke the Ardor belongeth not unto the Ascians alone. With thine own hand, strike down thine enemy─the so-called hero who would see thy home lost to Light. Do but this and thou wouldst, at a single stroke, disrupt the all too delicate balance of this realm, plunging her straightways into chaos.

**URIANGER:** You do realize what you're suggesting, yes?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** "To ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom─it is indolence.“ The words of my teacher, and a creed I hold close to my heart.

**URIANGER:** Very well. Draw her out. We'll make it quick.

**IRONMASK:** It shall be done. What good a creed one cannot uphold? What hurts soothed, what lives saved... O hapless fool, what hast thou wrought by thine own hands? Minfilia, my friends─I shall not now beg your forgiveness. Full deeply though it paineth me to walk it, I shall not stray from my chosen path. As Moenbryda remained steadfast, so too shall I...

**ALPHINAUD:** Brothers and sisters... Twenty years ago, Ala Mhigo, our home, was claimed by the Garlean Empire. In our haste to overthrow the King of Ruin, we turned a blind eye to our foes in the north. With our glorious revolution, we but laid a path for a new tyrant to succeed the old...and when confronted with our failure, we fled. Not a day goes by that I do not think of those we left behind─think of them, and feel ashamed. And I know each and every one of you feels the same. We abandoned them, our own flesh and blood, to labor till their backs gave in and their breath gave out, building the twisted steel ramparts which now mar our once majestic mountains. We abandoned them, the brave and true, to fight and die for their country─or worse, to be conscripted and sent off to rob another poor bastard of his home. We abandoned them, the meek and powerless, to bow and scrape when the Garleans pass─to sully themselves that they might live to see another day of misery. The Black Wolf may be dead, but a new imperial viceroy reigns in Ala Mhigo now. A beast not a fraction as merciful. You all know the Eorzean Alliance will do naught to oppose him. For all their promises and platitudes, they will not act if there's no profit in it. Only *we* can free our brothers and sisters from the Empire's tyranny, my friends! Only we have the courage to stand and fight! They have imprisoned us, they have enslaved us, and they have murdered us─but no more! Blood demands blood, and the Garleans shall pay for every drop they have spilt upon our lands! This I promise you, for we have a power within us, my friends─a power befitting our pride, our righteousness! Only join us, and we shall grant you the means to unleash it, and together we shall see the Ala Mhigan standard raised over the mountains of Gyr Abania once more!

**YDA:** "A power befitting their pride...“ Not at all ominous, that. Wait. Is that─?

**ALPHINAUD:** <gasp> What are you two doing here!?

**PAPALYMO:** I could ask you the same thing!

**IRONMASK:** Well, well, this is quite the surprise. Might I suggest we continue this conversation in more...*agreeable* surroundings?

**ALPHINAUD:** If you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, then I bid you join us! And those of you who cannot fight, fear not. For it is not strength of arms that will win this battle, but strength of heart! My thanks, comrades. You must be the esteemed adventurers of whom I have heard so much. I understand you have taken an interest in our cause.

**YDA:** A *great* interest, you might say. Your words have certainly made quite an impression on my friend and I. The Resistance has long─and some would say wisely─avoided open engagements with the Garleans, but you and yours seem confident against the world in arms. I can only assume you have good reason to be so bold. Why, one might even think you were planning to summon a primal. Because that would do much to explain the sizable shipment of crystals you recently received from your smuggler friends─whom our Ishgardian allies have since detained, lest you wonder.

**IRONMASK:** I'd like to hear more about the Griffin. The *real* Griffin. Your performance earlier didn't fool us!

**YDA:** Ah. The famous Scions of the Seventh Dawn. I should have known better than to think I could conceal the truth from you lot. (-The False Griffin-)You are right. I am not the Griffin. But I speak with his voice, and it was at his behest that we procured those crystals. (-The False Griffin-)You are wrong, however, if you think that we procured them to summon a primal. (-The False Griffin-)We used them to reach an accord with the Amalj'aa. In exchange for crystals to summon their god, they will aid us in the fight for Ala Mhigan liberation.

**IRONMASK:** You've got to be joking! Have you gone completely mad!? When people find out you helped the lizardmen summon Ifrit, they'll turn on the Resistance! Ala Mhigo will never be free!

**PAPALYMO:** (-The False Griffin-)This isn't a faerie tale, girl. We don't have the luxury to play at being honorable heroes. (-The False Griffin-)It's because the likes of you wouldn't sully your saintly hands that Ala Mhigo's been under the yoke for the past twenty years! But the Griffin won't stand for it, and neither will we! We're ready to do whatever it takes!

**IRONMASK:** What proof do you have of this arrangement with the Amalj'aa?

**PAPALYMO:** (-The False Griffin-)What, aside from a lack of crystals? None. But the beastmen have a great big pile of the things, if you fancy looking. You might want to hurry, though─it'll not be long before they summon their god. (-The False Griffin-)Search our camp if you don't believe me. We have naught to hide.

**IRONMASK:** If there is a cache to be found, Yda and I will find it.

**PAPALYMO:** (-The False Griffin-)Then let us be off. (-The False Griffin-)Are you perchance the Warrior of Light? (-The False Griffin-)Aye, I thought so. You should know that a great many who have joined us did so because you saved them─because you showed them that one brave woman can make a difference. (-The False Griffin-)You saved me too, once. Helped a friend over in Quarrymill make some medicine I needed. But that was a lifetime ago... (-The False Griffin-)On behalf of my brothers and sisters, I thank you. You gave us hope where there was none; courage and strength when all was lost. We shall not squander your gift.

**YDA:** I know that look, Yda, and I do not like it. You cannot seriously be contemplating taking up arms with that band of cutthroats?

**PAPALYMO:** I... I just...

**THANCRED:** If the Griffin and his men have their way, it is only a matter of time before the situation in Ala Mhigo comes to a head. Your homeland's future teeters on a knife-edge, and any reckless action, however small, could have irrevocable consequences. You mustn't lose sight of that, Yda. When the time comes, we must all make our choices, but we must do so in full possession of the facts. Now let us away─there is work to be done.

**ALISAIE:** This isn't right. The Amalj'aa would never leave this place so poorly guarded.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Not willingly, no.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hah hah! Ahhh, the saviors of Eorzea. Slow as ever.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** By the Twelve... Will you never learn?

**THANCRED:** You know, you're right. Mayhap it *is* time for a change of tack. Killing primals, tormenting beastmen, hastening the birth of a new god... It's all a bit much, isn't it? And, frankly, we don't have the leisure to do it. Killing the Warrior of Light, on the other hand─that would *soon* plunge Eorzea into chaos. One life for one world. A fair exchange─wouldn't you agree!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Lest you forget, you've more than one opponent!

**BARDOFDARKNESS:** Carbuncle, defend me!

**ALPHINAUD:** I sense you will offer more than mere target practice. Unlike your sister.

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Did...did I not tell you, Alphinaud? I am not the girl I once was. My brother was always the clever one, while my talents lay elsewhere... If you would dare to stand against us, to destroy all that we hold dear, then you shall die by my sword! As Eorzea's blade of Light once stood by my side, now I shall stand at hers─and defend this realm with all my might!

**ALPHINAUD:** Let's finish this! It ends, now! What!?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** The chains!

**URIANGER:** You *snake*. You would betray us as well?

**ALPHINAUD:** He that holdeth fast unto his convictions shall never count betrayal amongst his crimes, though all the world may call him villain. My path is unchanged; my creed sacrosanct. This I believe with all my heart. But say, Warrior of Darkness, and speak true─what dost *thou* believe? That rendering up the souls of thy world in service to the Rejoining will grant it salvation? Nay.

**URIANGER:** By the Twelve─Urianger!

**ALISAIE:** Mine apologies, Master Alphinaud. That the brightest light might shine, duty did compel me to walk in darkest shade.

**URIANGER:** You sweet fool. I was almost willing to believe you had turned against us. I expect a full explanation when this is over. For now, may I assume you have turned your cloak for the last time?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Thou mayest, my lady. By thy leave.

**BLACKMAGEOFDARKNESS:** Even odds, then. No matter. We'll crush the lot of you in one fell swoop!

**ALISAIE:** Understood.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hearken to me! We only have one chance! Channel your aether into my blade that I might strike before the mage casts his spell! I cannot do it alone, but together...together we can defeat them! Make ready! They come!

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie! Are you hurt?

**THANCRED:** A touch dizzy, but otherwise fine. Thank you.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** And there you have it. Our friend is too stubborn to die.

**THANCRED:** Hmph. We are far from finished. Or have you never considered how we came to this world?

**URIANGER:** Crystals? You mean...like the *Ascians*?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Just so. As the Ascians flee unto the rift 'twixt planes with Crystals of Darkness, so did these warriors come hither with Crystals of Light.

**THANCRED:** Eloquent, as always. Aye, like the Ascians, we too are beyond death! You cannot defeat that which is eternal!

**ALPHINAUD:** Hmph!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Wait! Such methods as the Ascians employ require the renunciation of the flesh. You...you would have had to...

**PALADINOFDARKNESS:** At long last, you see. To save our world, we gave our lives. We were just adventurers trying to make our way. An odd job here, a favor there─we never aspired to be Warriors of Light. But word of our deeds spread, and soon people were calling us heroes. They placed their hopes and dreams on our shoulders and bid us fight for all that was good and right. We fought and we fought and we fought...until there was no one left to fight. We *won*...and now our world is being erased from existence. We did *everything* right, everything that was asked of us, and still─*still* it came to this! You of all people should understand! We cannot─we *will* not falter. We brought our world to the brink of destruction, and now we must save it.

**WHITEMAGEOFDARKNESS:** I've died before, Arbert. I'm not afraid to die again.

**URIANGER:** No matter how many times we fall, we must rise and carry on the fight. For those we left behind.

**ALPHINAUD:** To have known the depths of sorrow and embrace the highest sacrifice─nonetheless...Master Louisoix, guide my hand, I pray you, as fate's thread spinneth upon this most capricious spindle. Quickly! Thou must needs invoke the power of thy crystal!

**MINFILIA:** What is this place?

**THANCRED:** Such pain... Such sorrow... Oh, my dear children...

**URIANGER:** I-It can't be!

**MINFILIA:** Mother Hydaelyn, hearken unto Your children's plea! From two worlds do we gather, and from two worlds do we offer a bounty of Light. In this desperate hour, we do beseech Your intercession! We beg an audience with the Word of the Mother─with Your chosen, Minfilia!

**ALPHINAUD:** Your cries go not unheard... Nor your sacrifices unnoticed... Though many are lost, there are those we can yet save... Whom I can yet save...

**MINFILIA:** Minfilia!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Blessed children of the First. The light of your world hath grown blinding in its radiance, but it is not yet absolute. I will hie me to your world and there take unto myself the Light which riseth even now to drown it, as Darkness once did drown another.

**MINFILIA:** *Now* you deign to answer our prayers!? I will suffer this farce no longer!

**URIANGER:** (-Minfilia-)As the Ascians must serve as instruments of Zodiark's will, so too must others carry out the will of Hydaelyn. (-Minfilia-)But for the boon you have granted Her, She has grown strong enough to set me free, that I might serve as Her emissary. (-Minfilia-)Your suffering, your sacrifice, your supplications─She has heard all. We will not let the First fall to Light. (-Minfilia-)Thank you, Urianger, for bringing everyone here. It fills my heart with joy to look upon the faces of my friends once more.

**ALPHINAUD:** In taking you unto Her bosom, I knew that Hydaelyn had bequeathed to you a sliver of Her grace, granting you strength long sought. And in treating with the Ascians, I learned of a star like unto our own─a doomed world of fallen heroes, in whom I glimpsed ourselves. The First. Full long did I search for a means to save this world, concluding at the last that the answer lay in the power of blessed crystals. And thus did I labor to set Light against Dark. Yet I knew from the beginning that this salvation would not come without sacrifice, for the instrument of the First's deliverance would of necessity be required to journey thither...there to remain, mayhap forever.

**URIANGER:** You orchestrated all of this not to save her, but to send her away!?

**MINFILIA:** One life for one world. Such was the bargain, and you the coin, though it were not mine to spend.

**THANCRED:** (-Minfilia-)Have we not walked together in the light of the Crystal, and at Her bidding borne witness to the joys and sorrows of this land? Each and every one of you knows my heart. If this be the price I must pay, I pay it gladly.

**MINFILIA:** ...You would go alone then?

**THANCRED:** (-Minfilia-)My dearest Thancred... You who have ever watched over me... I am truly grateful for all you have done on my behalf, as would my father be. (-Minfilia-)Your kindness, your compassion, your love... These are your gifts to me, and our gifts to them, forming a bond which transcends time and space.

**MINFILIA:** Sometimes I forget you are not the child I once knew. Make me proud.

**BLACKMAGEOFDARKNESS:** (-Minfilia-)Long have I watched you from Hydaelyn's side. Watched as you nurtured and kept safe the light of the dawn. (-Minfilia-)The dark recesses of the world hide untold secrets and dangers. Thus do I entrust to you Tupsimati. I pray you keep to the path that you may never have need of it.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** 'Twould seem the power of our crystals is all but spent. Perhaps...if there is naught else to be done...

**MINFILIA:** Hear me, servant of Hydaelyn. If you would have us place our trust in you, then I would ask a favor. Take us with you. Take us home. We were blind to the truth once. So I tell you this, as one fool to another. Light, Dark, it doesn't matter. What matters is how you choose to use them. We made our choice, and you see what came of it. So please...forge a different path. Seize a better fate.

**YDA:** (-Minfilia-)'Tis a strange feeling. So many times have I watched you depart, my heart filled with worry, and ever did you return to me in triumph. (-Minfilia-)Someday, when I have found a way to free this star from Her sorrow, I promise you I shall repay the favor. Thank you, Lhaminn...for everything...

**PAPALYMO:** Back in the solar! It's been too long since we were all together like this. Not since...not since after Moenbryda...

**ALPHINAUD:** Much has changed since then─we ourselves most of all.

**TATARU:** Though not all who were lost could be gathered here today, we may take comfort in the knowledge that those who are not are carrying on the fight.

**ALPHINAUD:** While I am grateful to our friends in the north for their hospitality...it isn't half-good to be back!

**YSHTOLA:** But, as Papalymo rightly said, much has changed since we last stood here. The Scions of the Seventh Dawn are not as they once were. Nor should we be. Our travels in the north brought us into contact with a host of fine and generous people, and their selfless deeds served to show me that it is not lofty causes that should inform our actions, but our hearts. And I hope that the Scions might continue in this manner: as individuals driven by individual principles. Provided we all sincerely desire to work towards Eorzea's salvation, I believe the paths we follow to achieve it need not─and should not─be dictated by any single ideal.

**KRILE:** Companions bound by a common purpose, free to go whither they will... The idea is not without merit. Very well. I shall resume my research of the primals and the elder gods of Eorzea. Should anyone have need of my findings, you need only ask. I should be glad of your continued assistance.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, my main purpose in coming here was to see the Scions of the Seventh Dawn restored and my dear friend found... Nevertheless, having involved myself in your struggles, I feel compelled to see them through to the bitter end. For Minfilia's sake. That is, if there are no objections?

**THANCRED:** You will always be welcome here, Krile.

**URIANGER:** Urianger, can we trust you to carry on your investigation of the Ascians as before?

**THANCRED:** Regardless of mine own desires, I am undeserving of your trust, having so villainously deceived you all.

**URIANGER:** Now, now, I'll hear no more of that. 'Twould be disrespectful of Minfilia's wishes. She entrusted matters here to us, that we might protect this star and understand the truth which hides at Her heart. Mayhap I can handle the former, but I think you far better suited to the latter, no?

**YDA:** Very well. Then out of love for my lady Minfilia and Moenbryda both, this shall be my solemn charge.

**ALPHINAUD:** I... *Papalymo and I* should probably return to Thanalan to keep an eye on the Resistance. There's still the matter of the Griffin and the Amalj'aa, not to mention the new imperial viceroy. That little lot must be worthy of our attention, right?

**ALISAIE:** And what will you do, Alisaie?

**ALPHINAUD:** You know I have no great love for organizations and formalities. That being said...this new approach you propose is not wholly objectionable. And we've always got her to keep us from bickering. But I will suffer no titles. I am not here for House Leveilleur, nor to walk in Grandfather's shadow.

**TATARU:** Upon that point, we see eye to eye. If it please you, you may think of me as but another comrade-in-arms.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well then, *Alphy*─I, for my part, shall see to the paperwork and the finances with my characteristic aplomb.

**000:** I would not have it any other way, Tataru. And we mustn't forget you. What now for the Warrior of Light?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? A new adventure, what else? The road goes ever on... To strive for those we have lost. For those we can yet save. ...

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed.

**PAPALYMO:** The path behind us was fraught with hardship, and the path before us will be no less unforgiving. But a new dawn *shall* break over the realm, and I see before me the faces of those who will deliver it.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**CID:** I leave the Goddess in your capable hands. Just watch out for her worshipers...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALPHINAUD:** We're here! Did we miss anything?

**ALISAIE:** We would not presume to begin without you, Yda.
Urianger has returned to the Waking Sands, but everyone else is now present.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes, but for *what*, exactly? We all have duties to attend to, Alphinaud, so you may dispense with the preamble.

**ALISAIE:** Thank you, Alisaie. It is the very subject of those duties which compelled me to call this gathering. Though the Warriors of Darkness no longer pose a threat, Eorzea's many troubles demand no less of our attention. And while I stand by the decision to approach each task as we see fit, I fear our effectiveness will ultimately be diminished should we continue to act in ignorance of each other's efforts. Thus I propose we elect a successor to Minfilia─not to serve as a fully fledged Antecedent, perhaps, but as a coordinator of operations.

**ALPHINAUD:** Is that all? Then the decision seems clear. No one else has shown any enthusiasm for the role. And judging by your performance at our previous meeting, you would seem the perfect candidate. You always did have a flair for politics.

**YSHTOLA:** I-I did not mean to─ That was not my intention. As my tenure as commander of the Crystal Braves comprehensively demonstrated, I lack the qualities required for such an office. I would much prefer to remain as I am now─a soldier in the field, so to speak.

**THANCRED:** Should none of our number step forward, must we then constrain some unwilling candidate to take up the position?

**PAPALYMO:** Well, based on merit alone, a certain adventurer would be my choice─though I concede she might struggle to balance her new responsibilities with, let me see...slaying primals, thwarting legatuses, and feeding the orphaned poor.

**TATARU:** Thancred makes a good point. Any who would wear such a mantle would be bound by its obligations. Have we not become sufficiently familiar with each other's methods to act without an overseer? At present, I see no cause to so willingly limit one of our number.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh! Oh, my goodness! You're─ Help! I need some help here!

**TATARU:** Tataru! Are you all right!?

**YDA:** *Me*!? I'm fine! It's this poor girl who just staggered in and collapsed on the floor that I'm worried about!

**YSHTOLA:** Naago!? Gods, how did─ Y'shtola, please, you have to help her!

**KRILE:** Krile, a hand if you would. Let us see about closing these wounds.

**MNAAGO:** Now, we've staunched the bleeding, but it may be a while before you can move about again. Though, having seen your wounds, I'm surprised you were still moving at all...

**YDA:** Thank you... My message... It was too important to delay. I took the shortest route I could, though I knew it was more heavily patrolled... As you can see, my efforts at evasion were not entirely successful.

**MNAAGO:** Honestly, you're too brave for your own good! What was so urgent that you needed to fight half the Empire to get here? You could have been killed!

**THANCRED:** I'm sorry, Yda. I had good reason... Ah, but I imagine your friends are wondering who this bloody mess of a Miqo'te is. My name is M'naago, and I belong to the Ala Mhigan Resistance. I came to warn Yda and Papalymo about one of our leaders─a man who calls himself the Griffin. He's always been dangerous, but he's planning something new...something reckless.

**MNAAGO:** The Griffin, you say? I've heard the name. Rumor has it, your man is eager to test his claws.

**PAPALYMO:** Aye, and on no easy target. He means to assault Baelsar's Wall from the Ala Mhigan side.

**MNAAGO:** But what does the Griffin possibly hope to gain from such an attack?

**ALPHINAUD:** From what I understand, he wants the fires of war to spread to Eorzea. And for that, he needs to control the border with Gridania.

**PAPALYMO:** ...So he means to spark a conflict between the Alliance and the imperial forces stationed in Ala Mhigo─to have Eorzea's armies aid in the liberation effort, whether they will it or no.

**KRILE:** His plan is flawed. Even should the Resistance succeed in occupying the Wall, they would not be able to hold it. Imperial reinforcements would drive them out within a week!

**YSHTOLA:** Be that as it may, if there is even a chance that this scheme could bring about an escalation in hostilities between Eorzea and the Empire, the Alliance must be informed.

**PAPALYMO:** Agreed. I shall depart for Limsa Lominsa forthwith and seek an audience with the Admiral. Thancred─Ul'dah is yours. Alphinaud and Alisaie─make haste to the Twelveswood, and notify the Elder Seedseer of the danger to Gridania. She will duly call a council of the Alliance leaders, whom you must be ready to receive. You will be our voice in Ishgard. Explain the situation to Ser Aymeric, and encourage him to send an envoy. Tataru, Krile─I leave the care of our injured messenger to you. See that she remains quiescent and her wounds closed. I believe that covers everything. Let us be about our tasks.

**KANESENNA:** I suspect the ill tidings from Gyr Abania will be held as a turning point─the beginning to a bloody end. The business of war was ever conducted with the coin of self-sacrifice. 'Twas Master Louisoix himself who taught us that such costs are not to be ignored or denied. And so I shall embrace them. When the time comes, I will make my choice─as you will yours.

**ALPHINAUD:** I bid you welcome, my friends. As you will by now be aware, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have come into possession of certain intelligence concerning recent developments in the region of Gyr Abania. It springs, I am assured, from an unimpeachable source─is that not so, Master Alphinaud?

**RAUBAHN:** Indeed, Elder Seedseer. Our information comes directly from a member of the Resistance's inner circle, and we have no cause to doubt its veracity.

**KANESENNA:** This “Griffin” of theirs is a fool if he thinks he can hold Baelsar's Wall against the Empire. When the imperials move to take it back, they will come in force─and the resulting fighting is all but certain to spill over into the Black Shroud...

**AYMERIC:** At the Battle of Carteneau, the combined might of three Grand Companies labored to contend with the remnants of but a single imperial legion. Alone, Gridania would be hard-pressed indeed to hold back the tide should the Garleans turn their minds from reclamation to invasion.

**YUGIRI:** May I once more convey my nation's deepest regrets for our inaction in the days prior to the Calamity. 'Tis a stain upon our ledger that I would fain remove. Elder Seedseer─I do hereby request leave to deploy a defensive force within the borders of Gridania. Ishgard's return to the Alliance shall be honored by more than mere ink upon parchment.

**KANESENNA:** The Doman people, too, would join any effort that weakens our common foe. We are few, but our most seasoned shinobi are at your disposal.

**RAUBAHN:** On behalf of my people, I offer you my humble thanks. Gridania welcomes your assistance.

**ALISAIE:** It is time we set our contingency plans in motion. Is the Alliance agreed? Then let us make ready for war. Victory favors the swift, and there is much to be done.

**ALPHINAUD:** The council knows that Ala Mhigo will not soon be wrested from the Empire, and its decision to bolster the border's defenses seems eminently practical. Why, then, Brother, do you scowl so?

**ILBERD:** I agree that they have chosen the wisest course available. Indeed, the only reasonable one. Yet something feels awry. In making ready for war, is the Alliance not granting the Griffin the very thing he desired? Any attempt to hold the Wall is doomed to failure, aye, but I wonder if we have misjudged the prize for which he plays...

**SOLDIERA02354:** <pant> <pant> You've beaten me, aye... But you cannot stop what I've begun. Behold─a glimpse of things to come!

**SOLDIERB02354:** We did it! We showed the bastards!

**SOLDIERC02354:** Aye! Victory is ours!

**LAURENTIUS:** And who knows, lads? Mayhap the Eorzeans'll finally see sense...when the enemy turns up on their *bloody doorstep*!

**SOLDIERC02354:** This is for Ala Mhigo... For Eorzea... They die, that others may live... Vanguards! Attack!

**SOLDIERB02354:** Seven hells, d'ye hear that?

**SOLDIERA02354:** War machines... How did they get here so quickly!?

**SOLDIERC02354:** S-Stand your ground! For the Resistance!

**SOLDIERA02354:** There's nowhere to run! We're cut off! Aaagh!

**PAPALYMO:** Gods help us... What were we thinking? The Empire's too big... Too powerful... Mighty Rhalgr... Grant us...the *strength*...to crush...our...

**ALPHINAUD:** There you are!

**YDA:** As you can see, our infiltrators did not elude me for long. Lady Yugiri is sending for an airship even as we speak.

**ILBERD:** What do we do!? This is a massacre!

**ALPHINAUD:** Heh heh heh heh... How wonderful to see you...*Commander*.

**ILBERD:** Ilberd! I should have known... This has to end! It has to end *now*! Do you not see your countrymen dying? Have your ideals rendered you blind even to that!? Order the retreat, and we will help your soldiers to safety!

**ALPHINAUD:** *Retreat*? With the moment of my triumph so close at hand? You truly are a sheltered child, Leveilleur.

**ILBERD:** Nidhogg's eyes! ...No abyss is too deep for you, I see. But trust me when I say that such power was not meant for mortal hands!

**ALPHINAUD:** How long have I struggled to reach this point! My countrymen so inured to the taste of defeat, they no longer balk at its bitterness. Shouting my throat raw with rallying cries, only to be greeted with dull eyes and blank faces! My “brothers” and “sisters” in Ul'dah have surrendered to their apathy and their appetites. Were it not for the glint of Lolorito's coin, I doubt even those here now would have answered my call! "Take back our homeland! Free Ala Mhigo!“ Hah! They'll happily mouth the words, but they won't spill the blood! You say no mortal should wield these eyes? Then I shall gladly become a demon! I will suckle on the souls of the hopeless, and liberate the homeland they no longer deserve!

**ILBERD:** What exactly do you mean to do...?

**PAPALYMO:** Did you hear their cries as victory was snatched away from them? Even with their dying breaths they cursed the Empire! Never has their desire for vengeance been so raw, so true! A god has no need of faith when *summoned* by so pure a purpose!

**ALPHINAUD:** Summoned!?

**ILBERD:** You cannot mean to fight the Empire with a primal! You know full well the danger─the *futility* of relying on such power!

**PAPALYMO:** Oh, yes, I know their limitations─which is why I will call upon a deity more terrible than the very black wyrm of the Calamity itself!

**YDA:** What... Here!? Now!?

**ILBERD:** Like hells you will!

**ALPHINAUD:** An ending to mark a new beginning... For Ala Mhigo! An ending to mark a new beginning... My pain! My longing! You shall have it all! Hahaha─aaaaaaargh!

**PAPALYMO:** This light, is it...

**YDA:** His death completed the ritual. The primal is taking shape.

**PAPALYMO:** Well, can't we stop it!? There must be something we can do!

**YDA:** There is...one thing.

**PAPALYMO:** Wha─? Hey! Where do you think you're going!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Master Louisoix briefly contained Bahamut by means of a potent spell of sealing. I will now attempt to do the same.

**PAPALYMO:** But that's impossible! We would need hours to collect the necessary aether, i-if not days!

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, Alphinaud... Though I concede it may not always be apparent, I was ever your grandsire's finest pupil.

**YDA:** Tupsimati, of course! The staff still holds enormous power, broken or not.

**YUGIRI:** Don't you dare, Papalymo! I know how that spell works!

**PAPALYMO:** It is time to leave!

**YDA:** Quite right! Quickly, now! Off you go! The further away the better!

**PAPALYMO:** No! If you're staying, then so am I!

**ALPHINAUD:** No, Yda! There is a path only you can walk, and it must not end here─not like this! Take her! Please, you have to take her!

**YDA:** Ugh...

**PAPALYMO:** Wha─ No! Damn it, Thancred! Put me down! Thancred!

**000:** This is one battle you cannot fight. Away with you. Go!

**THANCRED:** What will you do? Trust in Papalymo and leave on the airship. Stay at Papalymo's side.

**PAPALYMO:** Hilda! I think he means now!

**GOSETSU:** I bid thee farewell again, my dear Yda... Now, let us see how good a student I truly was...

**PASSER02356:** (-Towering Traveler-)A word if you would, good sir. This place, it is within the realm of Eorzea?

**GOSETSU:** You're an odd-looking fellow, aren't you? Still...takes all sorts, I s'pose. This here's Vesper Bay─“Thanalan's door to the ocean,” as some folk like to call it...

**PASSER02356:** (-Towering Traveler-)Am I to understand from your answer that I have indeed arrived in Eorzea?

**GOSETSU:** Eh? ...Yes. You're in Eorzea.

**PASSER02356:** (-Towering Traveler-)Ah, a plain response at last! And the one I wanted, at that! My journey was not without its hardships, and I would sooner travel by land than put to sea again! (-Towering Traveler-)You do not believe that so small a bark could bear me across the ocean? Such timid little sailors! I had but to set my course, then set my jaw till I made port! (-Towering Traveler-)Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah! (-Towering Traveler-)Though...'twould perhaps have been wise to lay down my oars a moment to sup on more than the spray of brinewater. By the trembling of my limbs, I sense a brief repast may be in order... (-Towering Traveler-)Nay! I will not hearken to the feeble grumblings of an empty belly! Duty comes before all!

**URIANGER:** Good gods, man! Are you all right?

**KANESENNA:** Thou art far indeed from home, friend...

**BODYGUARD01623:** Dear friends...pray accept my heartfelt thanks for your efforts in defense of Gridania's borders. I would fain dwell longer on my gratitude for the support of the Alliance, but the situation at Baelsar's Wall demands that we forgo such pleasantries.

**RAUBAHN:** According to our most recent intelligence, the cocoon of light that formed in the air above the Wall remains undimmed and unbroken. After measuring the cocoon's aetheric concentrations, Archon Y'shtola has confirmed the presence of a primal entity...

**BODYGUARD01623:** Hmph. So we must assume that Ilberd's thrice-damned god is indeed trapped within. And what news of the imperials? They are not like to ignore such a spectacle.

**KANESENNA:** Sir. A Garlean airship was observed making an approach, but the vessel was destroyed when it drew near. The Empire appears to have made no subsequent attempts to reach the object.

**ALISAIE:** The soldiers who witnessed the incident spoke of a “lance of light” issuing from within the cocoon. Of an entire warship being reduced to smoking ruin in the space of a moment... Veterans of Carteneau, meanwhile...likened the destruction to that wrought by the fiery wrath of Bahamut.

**ALPHINAUD:** We could face another Calamity...

**CID:** So the primal is awake, then? Contained, yes, but for how long? We must destroy it now, lest it break free!

**NERO:** Agreed. There is, however, the small matter of how to get close enough to a being that swats warships from the sky as you would a bothersome gnat...

**CID:** (-???-)Is this truly so complex a puzzle? Or have you no *stomach* for the obvious solution?

**NERO:** What in the hells are *you* doing here!?

**AYMERIC:** A pleasure to see you too, Garlond. Now, if you would be so kind as to explain to these good people why you should be *begging me* for my assistance, that would be most appreciated.

**NERO:** Who is this man?

**CID:** Oh, how terrifically rude of me! Nero tol Scaeva, former tribunus of the XIVth Legion of the Garlean Empire. These days, however, one might say that I am something of a free agent.

**NERO:** What do you want, Nero?

**RAUBAHN:** I was *getting* to that. Although you already know what I am about to propose, old friend. As you have rather belatedly realized, within that frail binding lurks an entity alike in strength to the great Bahamut. And the only force in existence which might conceivably contend with such a foe is the very creation which captured the elder primal in the first place. I speak, of course, of Omega.

**NERO:** Omega!? That hulk has been gathering dust beneath the plains of Carteneau since the Allagans breathed their last! And none alive knows how to wake it.

**CID:** I'm sorry─do you understand who it is with whom you have the privilege of speaking? I am Nero tol Scaeva, master engineer─the mechanical genius who restored the Ultima Weapon to full operational capacity! And, as luck would have it, I am graciously offering you the use of my considerable expertise.

**NERO:** And, what, you just expect us to accept? Why would we trust the word of a man who furnished the Black Wolf with the means to subjugate Eorzea? And, what, you just expect us to accept? You're a fool if you think your deeds at the Crystal Tower were enough to win my trust, Nero.

**KANESENNA:** Trust? You wound me, Garlond! All those years studying side by side at the Academy, sharing both trial and triumph. We were countrymen, once, you and I. But sentiment aside─have you a better solution? Or do you mean to send in your vaunted hero there, as you always do, and pray the world is not engulfed in flame? Let us approach the problem in a rational manner. Does not the fact that Omega slumbers in stasis point to the existence of some overriding technology? A means of control?

**NERO:** I would ask a question, if I may─Nero, was it not? In the event that we succeeded in using Omega to shackle the primal in the manner you propose, what then would become of it? Do we not risk repeating the mistakes of the Allagans?

**CID:** Omega is but a tool. How we choose to employ that tool is entirely up to us. Of course, if you would rather leave it buried beneath Carteneau while you continue your petty squabbles above, then I suppose that is also your choice.

**NERO:** Spare us, Nero! The Seedseer's concern is a valid one. He who controls Omega wields the power of the gods. The very power which led the Allagans to destroy themselves.

**CID:** And does it not fall to we engineers to prevent such misuse? What was your company's proud slogan? “Freedom through Technology”?

**000:** Hah. A creed you follow, is it? <sigh> What say you? Do we take this villain at his word?

**CID:** What will you say? He makes a convincing case. No, but I'll keep an eye on him.

**KANESENNA:** He makes me grind my teeth is what he does, but I suppose we don't have much of a choice. ...As will I. I don't like it, but then it doesn't look like we have much choice. Would the council be willing to entrust this matter to a pair of former imperials?

**RAUBAHN:** Yes. The task of restoring the Allagan relic will be yours. But the responsibility for its reawakening must remain with the council. Do we condone this course of action?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye. 'Twould seem we do. Let the records show that we invest this contingent with the authority to enter Carteneau and take command of Omega. Cid, I appoint you leader of the expedition. Scions─I would ask that you assign some few of your number to escort Master Garlond and supervise the other one.

**ALISAIE:** We should be happy to oblige. The politics of Carteneau being what they are, I daresay our neutrality will prove useful in avoiding any unnecessary entanglements.

**YUGIRI:** If I am not mistaken, Doma occupies a similarly neutral position. Might we not persuade you to join the expedition, Lady Yugiri? If you suspected any foul play from Nero, you would be welcome to kill him.

**NERO:** My blade is yours.

**TATARU:** Not a moment's hesitation, eh? You'll forgive me if I do not shake your hand. Hm. So these are the fabled headquarters of the Scions... I confess, I would have expected an order of self-proclaimed warrior-scholars to surround themselves with the fruits of man's enlightenment. And yet there is not so much as a single piece of magitek in sight. It never ceases to amaze me how primitive you Eorzeans truly are...

**ALPHINAUD:** Hmph! I'll have you know that the Rising Stones is home to the very latest in magitek innovation. Wedge calls it the “Mark XIV Thermocoil Boilmaster,” and it's the finest kettle I've ever had the pleasure to own.

**YDA:** We are returned. Well, Yda and I, at least. Y'shtola and the others remained behind to continue their assessment of the binding magick.

**GOSETSU:** There didn't seem much point staying just for that, so I decided to come back with Alphinaud. Papalymo bought us this time. We shouldn't waste it.

**ALISAIE:** (-Towering Traveler-)By your leave!

**GOSETSU:** Good gods. That voice could fell a gigas...

**ALISAIE:** (-Towering Traveler-)This is the Rising Stones, domicile of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn? I enter at the invitation of one Lord Urianger! (-Towering Traveler-)Ho-ho! I spy you there, shadow walker. You always were a hard one to find!

**YUGIRI:** Yugiri...? Do you know this man?

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu!? Why are you come to Eorzea?

**YUGIRI:** In search of you, Yugiri! For days and nights did I row across the angry sea... I made port in good spirits, only for my own flesh to betray me over the trifling matter of an empty belly! Collapsed in the street like an unfed stray, I was, until Lord Urianger came to my aid. Over a most welcome meal, we spoke of the plight of Doma, and I learned of our displaced countrymen's work to resettle this blighted land. 'Twas blind fortune I was able to locate you so swiftly! But now we must make ready to depart! Our master languishes in dire peril, and Doma calls her daughter home!

**GOSETSU:** It is not so simple, Gosetsu. There are obligations which bind me here...

**YUGIRI:** You─ You *refuse*? Did you mislay your oath during your flight from our homeland? The laws of hospitality must be honored, but surely the vow to defend your master demands the greater obeisance!

**GOSETSU:** It was our master who bid me guide our people to safe haven by any means necessary. And it was the Scions you see before you who provided us succor and sanctuary when all others refused.

Dire peril or no, were I to return without first repaying such “hospitality,” our master would cut me down at the threshold.

**YUGIRI:** Mayhap that is so...

**NERO:** There is more. A crisis threatens all within this realm, Eorzean and Doman alike, and I go to play my part in its resolution. I will not bring shame upon our liege by abandoning my people or my duty.

**GOSETSU:** How very noble of you. Now, in the name of honor, kinship, and─ah, yes─*practicality*, might I suggest we get this expedition underway? Or would you rather debate the finer points of duty and leave Omega to the *Empire*?

**NERO:** The Empire!? Yugiri? You draw steel against the curs of Garlemald? Then why did you not say so!? My blade is oathbound to fall upon the ranks of the imperials wheresoever they march! Lead on, shadow walker. And may the enemy tremble at our coming!

**CID:** Now where was the...? Ah! I've enabled the teleporter. One brief jump, and we shall arrive in Omega's control room.

**NERO:** How convenient. ...You've been here before.

**CID:** Of course. 'Twas no easy task threading a path through all the skirmishers... But how could I ignore the existence of such a fascinating toy! You may trust that my preliminary examination was suitably thorough.

**GRYNEWAHT:** Trust? Aye. I trust your appetite for technology.

**NERO:** I chase down a suspect airship, and who should I find but the traitor, Cid Garlond! Searching for something, engineer? Something big? It's close, isn't it!? Bwahahahaha! It's like all my namedays have come at once!

**CID:** Of all the scouts the Empire could have sent...
Take care of that brute, will you!

**GOSETSU:** Godsdammit, I can't let Nero tinker around in there by himself. Sorry to leave you to it─but I daresay you'll manage without me. This clod has no idea who he's dealing with...

**NERO:** I am Gosetsu, samurai of Doma! You will rue your choice of opponent this day!

**CID:** Temporal stasis disengaged. All systems operational─Garlond?

**NERO:** All clear on this side! It's waking up...

**CID:** Remarkable! Omega's sensors immediately detected the presence of the cocoon even at this distance. They must have been set to scan for sources of energy exceeding certain magnitudes.

**NERO:** I still don't see any means to control the machine directly. It seems to have been designed to act wholly autonomously... Hmm. Once we release Omega, we can be fairly certain it will attempt to capture the primal at Baelsar's Wall. Assuming its mission is successful, our only option at that point will be to reengage its stasis system and put it back to sleep.

**YDA:** And should the machine happen to misbehave, we'll simply initiate an emergency shutdown. I confess, we don't yet have a *complete* grasp of its capabilities, but I'm certain the details will not elude us for long.

**000:** Well...I understood less than half of that. So─my question to you is: are we doing the right thing?

**YDA:** What will you say? Well, what do you think? Is there any other way?

**CID:** What do *I* think...? I...suppose not. All right. Step aside, Cid. Is this the thing I need to press?

**YDA:** Uh...yes. That's the one.

**NERO:** You gave too much for us to waste this chance, Papalymo. So, this is for you...and me.

**CID:** Hahahahahahahaha! Yes! Fly free, my pretty! Show us what you can do!

**GOSETSU:** The launch sequence has begun. Omega is loose. Hm? Omega has stopped transmitting. But that shouldn't be, I─I didn't engage the stasis system.

**NERO:** And what does this signify? I have little understanding of these contrivances...

**CID:** The launch went exactly to plan, but all signals emanating from Omega have ceased. This may indicate any number of things, but we will need to join the Scions out in the field if we are to ascertain which one.

**YDA:** Right, I've ordered the malfunctioning beast to go to sleep. That should prevent any unfortunate mishaps. I suggest we make our way back to Gridania.

**ALPHINAUD:** Omega destroyed the cocoon... Papalymo's spell is fading. It was bound to his aether, you see...and if the connection is broken...

**YSHTOLA:** My friends... I cannot well express how glad I am to see you both unharmed. They say that Omega's clash with the primal shook the very firmament...

**KRILE:** You need not have worried─the battle took place far above the ground. We were able to observe in relative safety, though I am given to understand that there were casualties on the far side of the Wall.

**ALPHINAUD:** It was like watching a nightmare unfold before our very eyes. Ilberd's primal manifested in the form of a colossal dragon─a being of pure violence. It burst forth from the cocoon with such terrible force...

**KRILE:** That such a horror should spring from the eyes of Nidhogg comes as no surprise. Nor do I wonder at its form. Ilberd all but announced it in the moments prior to his death. Plainly, it was his dying wish to visit a second Calamity upon the Empire.

**ALPHINAUD:** And I am quite certain the abomination would have obliged, had it not found itself outmatched by Omega. Gods... I am no stranger to the works of Allag, but even I was unprepared for the machine's furiosity. It beggared belief.

**YSHTOLA:** And how fares poor Yda in the midst of all of this? Have you spoken with her?

**YDA:** She is up on the platform, lost in thought. We deemed it best not to disturb her, but mayhap she would welcome some company after all. Shall we?

**ALPHINAUD:** The light's gone. It was all we had left of him...

**YDA:** Yda...

**YSHTOLA:** I don't blame anyone. I knew what was going to happen. I knew the spell Papalymo meant to cast would drain away his life force─I...knew that it would only buy us a little time...

**YDA:** Yda, there is no need to explain.

**YSHTOLA:** But there is. I can't hide in Papalymo's little shadow anymore and I shouldn't hide behind my sister's mask. Twenty years ago, on the day the Empire marched into Ala Mhigo, I was still just a child─not even five summers old. My father had been one of the leaders of the revolution. He had fought to overthrow the mad king, Theodoric. And my sister had fought alongside him. She was strong and kind, and always knew what to do. But when the Garleans came, everything changed. My father went to war against them too, and I never saw him again. After that, I remember a lot of running. My sister dragged me for malms and malms until we came to the city of Sharlayan. That was where she met Master Louisoix. He introduced her to the Circle of Knowing, and she eventually became an Archon.

**YDA:** She was your inspiration. Is that not why you took up her mask and her name? ...Or did you simply mean to continue what she had started?

**YSHTOLA:** ...You've known all along, haven't you? That I wasn't Yda.

**YDA:** Of course. We all recognized you at once. 'Twas Papalymo who persuaded us to maintain the charade.

**000:** It was silly to think I could fool you. I knew that even then. But I...I sort of...decided not to know. Yda died six years ago, on a mission to smuggle refugees out of Ala Mhigo. They say she was overwhelmed by imperial soldiers when she stayed behind to save a little girl. She was so strong... There must have been a lot of them.

**YDA:** What will you say? Why did you never tell me? ...

**YUGIRI:** (-Lyse-)I'm sorry for lying to you. My real name is Lyse. (-Lyse-)When Papalymo brought me Yda's mask, it was meant as a keepsake. But I decided I wanted to be his new partner; to keep alive all the good that she had done. (-Lyse-)I didn't want to *become* Yda, exactly... At the time, though, I still didn't know who I was myself, and it almost seemed easier to play the role. (-Lyse-)Papalymo agreed to help, of course...but it was never what he wanted for me. He wanted me to walk my own path. And those were his final words to me. (-Lyse-)The Archon's mark he gave me is faded, and my last excuse along with it. (-Lyse-)So, this is it. Whatever I choose to do from now on, I do as Lyse.
...And I choose to continue my family's fight. I want Ala Mhigo to be the country that Yda and my father always wanted it to be!

**GOSETSU:** War is upon us once more.

**YUGIRI:** Do you regret standing against the Empire? Would you have chosen a different road, knowing what you know now?

**GOSETSU:** To claim that I never doubted the decision would be a lie. But I made my choice, and I have defended it with blade in hand ever since.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**TATARU:** The question is, how will the Empire respond to the disappearance of Omega and the primal... Oh, I didn't see you there. Forgive me. Word from Baelsar's Wall is proving long in the coming, and my mind cannot help but stray to grim places.

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud! A message from the Alliance!

**TATARU:** It's about time! Pray summon the others at once.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes, sir!

**YSHTOLA:** ...General Aldynn reports that his forces have secured the breach in Baelsar's Wall.

**ALPHINAUD:** And what of the primal and Omega?

**LYSE:** There is still no sign of either at this time. He writes that they will begin a more thorough investigation shortly... And, as expected, he wishes to petition the aid of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Lyse-)As expected?

**ALISAIE:** The Alliance's decision to capture a part of Baelsar's Wall is...open to interpretation.

**ALPHINAUD:** The Wall serves to demarcate imperial territory, Ala Mhigo included, from the rest of Eorzea. To an observer, the Alliance's actions could be seen as a prelude to invasion.

**LYSE:** Indeed. And the Alliance leaders have no wish to be branded invaders.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Lyse-)You're saying they won't fight for Ala Mhigo? Even after everything that's happened?

**YSHTOLA:** Not without the consent of her people, no. Make no mistake, Lyse─the Alliance is in complete agreement that the Empire must be purged from Eorzea. However, they will not set foot in Gyr Abania until they have formally secured the consent and cooperation of the Ala Mhigan opposition.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...They would have us act as intermediaries?

**LYSE:** Precisely. The Scions are uniquely qualified to serve in this capacity─that is to say, Lyse is, given her personal connection to the Resistance. Who better than you to broker an agreement between the Alliance and the people of Ala Mhigo? ...Assuming you are willing, of course?

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Lyse-)Of course I am. You know I'd like nothing more!

**LYSE:** As for who should accompany you on said diplomatic mission...I had a mind to volunteer myself.

**000:** (-Lyse-)Well, that covers the talking part. But you just know there'll be trouble along the way. Are you available?

**LYSE:** What will you say? As if you have to ask! ...

**YSHTOLA:** (-Lyse-)Thanks. It means a lot, knowing you'll be there. (-Lyse-)Look, I know I've kept things from you, and I'm sorry, I really am. But that's all over now, I swear. And...it'd mean a lot to me, having you at my side.

**KRILE:** I too shall accompany you. Such endeavors are seldom hampered by a surfeit of healers.

**ALISAIE:** Good point! Allow me to offer my services as well.

**URIANGER:** I have spent quite enough time here of late, so I'll be coming, but we will need someone to keep an eye on things. I trust you have no objections?

**THANCRED:** None, my lady. Gladly shall I continue to serve as caretaker of the Waking Sands, and there keep watch for signs of primal and Ascian activity both.

**ALPHINAUD:** As capable as my learned friend undoubtedly is, there are some troubles that may prove too much for a single Scion─on account of which, I mean to stay.

**TATARU:** It is settled, then. Let us each see to our preparations. Ready, my friend? Well, then. Tataru─I leave the Rising Stones in your capable hands.

**YUGIRI:** Don't worry, Alphinaud! I'll see that the place is still standing when you come back!

**ALPHINAUD:** Mistress Y'shtola has unfolded all. You are bound for Gyr Abania?

**YUGIRI:** Aye. The Alliance would have us make contact with the Ala Mhigan Resistance as soon as possible.

**ALPHINAUD:** It begins, then─as soon it shall in Doma, if the gods are good. 'Tis but a pity that it must be now. I am sorry that we shall not be present to fight beside you in the battles to come...

**YUGIRI:** You have stood with us countless times, Lady Yugiri. Pray do not apologize.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then let us thank you instead. You and yours stood with us from the first, when we came to this land as refugees in search of sanctuary. Loath am I to think what might have become of my people had you not extended to us the hand of friendship. We will never forget─this I solemnly swear.

**YUGIRI:** Much has changed since first you set foot on these shores. Revenant's Toll stands as a testament to that. I am sure your people will manage in your absence.

**LYSE:** Indeed. They have built a new home for themselves, and no longer need me to shepherd them. The time has come for Gosetsu and I to return to our master─to our home.

**GOSETSU:** (-Lyse-)I know how you feel. It's time I went home too...

**LYSE:** Though our battlefields be a thousand malms apart, our purpose is one! Let all men hearken to the clarion call of freedom─of liberation─from Eorzea to the Far East, that they may rise up and cast down the curs of Garlemald!

**YUGIRI:** (-Lyse-)Take care, you hear me? When all of this is over, we're going to celebrate─together─just you wait!

**LYSENARRATION:** I should like that very much. Fare you well.

**CONRAD:** I remember crossing the border. Standing in Gyr Abania once more.
Me and my fellow Scions...the Warrior of Light among us. Behind us, Baelsar's Wall, cutting the land in two.
Freedom on one side, tyranny on the other. Tyranny...and the promise of a new beginning.
But one that could only be bought with flames and blood. I remember the old stories.
How the breaker of worlds came down from on high and cleft the earth with a single blow. Rhalgr's Reach. A holy place, and a fitting home for the Resistance.
For the brave and the true, the loyal sons and daughters of Ala Mhigo. They were waiting for us there. Men and women whose souls still cried out for what was lost.
For what could be ours again.

**ALPHINAUD:** Allow me to welcome you once more to Rhalgr's Reach, our humble headquarters. My name is Conrad Kemp, and I have the dubious honor of overseeing operations here.

**CONRAD:** It is a pleasure to meet you, Master Kemp. I am Alphinaud Leveilleur, of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, as are my comrades. Before I speak of our purpose here, pray allow me to thank you for sheltering Yda─forgive me─Lyse and Papalymo at great risk to yourselves.

**LYSE:** Now, now, there's no need for that. They risked their necks for us enough times. 'Twas the least we could do.

**CONRAD:** I-I wanted to... I mean, about the mask and...

**LYSE:** Ahhh, don't fret over that. You're not the first person to take up arms against the Empire under a false name. We'd do the same if we had any sense.
...My condolences for your loss, child.

**CONRAD:** ...Papalymo laid down his life to save us─to give us a chance to make a better future for ourselves. There will never be a better time to drive the Garleans from our lands. But we have to take the lead on this─we can't leave it to fanatics like Ilberd.

**ALPHINAUD:** More than a few of our people were taken in by his promises. Followed him all the way to the Wall. Good men and women who never came back. When M'naago told us what had happened─how the bastard had made sacrifices of them for his twisted ritual─by Rhalgr, it filled me with an unholy fury... But what's done is done. Best we can do now is see that it wasn't all in vain.

**CONRAD:** That is why we are here today, sir─to see that some good comes of this tragedy. On behalf of the Eorzean Alliance, we do hereby extend a formal offer of military assistance to the Ala Mhigan Resistance.

**ALPHINAUD:** Do you, now? Well, go on then. I'm sure there's more to it than that. ...So that's the way of it, eh? The Alliance, hoping to avoid a direct confrontation with the superior forces of the Empire, wishes to engage them by proxy with our vastly inferior ones? My comrades and I must confer on your proposal. A moment, if you please...

**CONRAD:** Of course, Master Kemp. Take all the time you require.

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you all for waiting. We have reached a consensus. I, Conrad Kemp, do hereby accept the Eorzean Alliance's proposal. You must understand, however, that our cooperation comes with certain caveats.

**CONRAD:** Those caveats being...?

**ALPHINAUD:** I take no joy in this, just so you know. Were it within my power, I'd offer you more assistance. But the Resistance is far more fragmented than you realize. The men and women in my care belong to but one of many factions. Simply put, I can only speak for the people of Rhalgr's Reach. Now, I have every intention of appealing to the others, and I expect many will agree─but it will take time, and I cannot guarantee universal support.

**CONRAD:** Understood. I shall see that the Alliance is under no misapprehensions as to your position.

**LYSE:** Much obliged...but that's not the whole of it. As you can imagine, the loss of those who cast their lot with the Griffin left us short on numbers. Some of our most trusted veterans died at the Wall, and we've had to fill their posts with the young and inexperienced. Frankly, everything's in a right bloody mess.

**CONRAD:** Oh, we'd be more than happy to help you get back on your feet. If we're going to work together, we'll be doing ourselves a favor!

**KRILE:** Well, there's no shortage of work to be done, that's for sure. We're in dire need of new blood too.

**ALPHINAUD:** Y'shtola and I could lend a hand in the infirmary. From what I saw, they could do with a few more healers.

**LYSE:** Very well. I, for my part, shall return to the Rising Stones. I am certain there are others among the Scions who would welcome the opportunity to fight for Ala Mhigan liberation.

**CONRAD:** Um... Is there anything else we can do to help?

**LYSE:** I had something else in mind for you lot. M'naago and Meffrid will tell you more.

**RAUBAHN:** Understood. We won't let you down.

**ALISAIE:** It is good to see you again, my friends. I hope you are here to tell me you have made contact with the Resistance?

**MNAAGO:** We are, General. Allow me to introduce M'naago, of Rhalgr's Reach.

**RAUBAHN:** At your service, sir! And may I say what an absolute honor it is to stand before the Bull of Ala Mhigo!

**MNAAGO:** These are not the bloodsands, girl. You and I are but soldiers on a battlefield fighting for the same cause.

**RAUBAHN:** A-As you say, General! Ahem. On behalf of Commander Kemp of the Ala Mhigan Resistance, I present to you our formal response.

**MNAAGO:** ...Good. I am glad we have reached an accord. Though I was not aware you had suffered such losses.

**ALISAIE:** Aye... Some of our finest took part in the Griffin's doomed assault, and we've been struggling to find new recruits ever since. The massacre has cast a pall over the whole Resistance, and many who might once have been open to joining us have since thought better of it.

**RAUBAHN:** After all of the Griffin's false promises, one can hardly blame them. They have no desire to give their lives for a lost cause.

**PIPIN:** We will not lie to them. This is war, and lives will be lost. Yet what we offer is not the fever dream of a madman, but true hope.

**MNAAGO:** The people need proof of this, Father. Let us show it to them. I say we stand shoulder to shoulder with our new allies and engage the Garleans in open warfare. The Resistance must demonstrate that they can hold their own against imperial regulars, and with our assistance, I am confident they can do just that. If we can achieve even a token victory, I believe it will serve to rekindle the hope of the Ala Mhigan people, and inspire them to rise up once more.

**PIPIN:** Aye, aye... Once word spread that we'd won a battle against the Garleans, I wager we'd have new recruits flocking to us from malms around. The question is, when and where do we strike?

**GRYNEWAHT:** I'm glad you asked. I have a plan...

**RAUBAHN:** Things looked grim for us after Carteneau, didn't they? Oh, how they doubted us... Yet here we are, right as rain, with fancy new toys to put through their paces... Bwahahahaha! It's like all my namedays have come at once! Well, well, well! If it isn't Garlond's little troublemaker! Heh heh heh! I can't wait to see the look on Zenos's face when I bring him your head! That is, if my secret weapons here don't grind it into mush! ATTAAACK! Gaaah! Damn it all! Miracles of magitek design, my arse! I've passed harder stools than these piles of scrap! You'll pay for this! Mark my words, the next time we meet will be the last!

**ALISAIE:** Aye! Run and tell your viceroy! The day belongs to Ala Mhigo! [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**CONRAD:** [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**MNAAGO:** [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**SERPENTSSOLDIER:** [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**FLAMESSOLDIER:** [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**ALAMHIGANLIBERATORA:** [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**LYSENARRATION:** [TRIUMPHANT ROAR]

**LYSE:** I remember the peaks of Gyr Abania. Silent watchmen that would stand long after we were gone. We came seeking allies to join us in the fight against the Empire. People who had had enough. People who had suffered every possible indignity.
Who had been treated like animals, day after day after day...

**MEFFRID:** Are they imperials?

**LYSE:** Worse. Skulls. Listen, Lyse─whatever happens, stay hidden and do not intervene. Understood?

**SKULLSOLDIERA:** What?

**G3F2VILLAGER:** You there─halt! You know you shouldn't be here... Explain yourself.

**SKULLSOLDIERA:** Forgive me, sir! I-I came to deliver the tributum!

**G3F2VILLAGER:** ...Oh aye? A likely story! Only a fool would dare to come so late.
Or mayhap...a Resistance spy.

**SKULLSOLDIERA:** No! No, you've got it all wrong! I was waylaid by bandits! It's not my fault!

**G3F2VILLAGER:** I said halt!

**SKULLSOLDIERB:** [GETTING PUNCHED REAX]

**G3F2VILLAGER:** ...Is this a joke? You don't seriously expect us to believe this is a fifth?
How stupid do you think we are?

**SKULLSOLDIERA:** It is, I swear! On me mother's life...

**MEFFRID:** Spare us. You came late, you lied about bandits, and then you tried to cheat the Empire of its due.

**LYSE:** Think you can kill them all─including the ones watching from the tower? Even if you did, others would come for him─and his family. You'd be condemning them all to a life of hard labor─assuming they didn't just execute them, that is.

**SKULLSOLDIERA:** But it isn't fair!

**FORDOLA:** It's your bloody fault we're stuck out here patrolling this godsforsaken wasteland! It's your fault I have to listen to people go on and on about how “Ala Mhigans can't be trusted”! I've worked and toiled harder than any man! I'm a citizen, godsdammit! And what are you!? A stupid, stubborn little dog who'd sooner bite the hand that feeds him and pine for the good old days!

**MEFFRID:** That's enough! Lord Zenos is expecting our report.

**GARLEANLEADERA:** I'll bet the poor bastard can't believe his luck. He gets to go home.
We should do the same.

**ZENOS:** (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)Alliance forces have occupied Castrum Oriens and taken up positions along the length of the Wall. Our patrols have engaged their reconnaissance parties on sight, but there have been no significant exchanges... (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)...Save one. A unit tasked with field-testing prototype magitek weapons was attacked. The weapons were destroyed, with the unit sustaining near-total casualties.

**GARLEANLEADERB:** ...Near-total? Go on.

**ZENOS:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)My lord, there was but a single survivor from the unit in question, which falls under my command. (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)According to his report, they were ambushed by a contingent of Eorzean Alliance regulars, abetted by Resistance insurgents.

**GARLEANLEADERB:** Hm. A simple ambush, and only one survivor. A fine day's work. The stubbornness to survive is not without worth... He may live. However, the XIIth is no place for the weak.

**ZENOS:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)He shall be relegated at once, my lord. As you say, the XIIth is no place for cowards who count their lives more precious than the cause.

**GARLEANLEADERB:** Indeed, indeed. We have no need of cowards...

**ZENOS:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)M-My lord, I... (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)[KILLED BY SWORD REAX]

**FORDOLA:** Cowards who defer critical missions to their subordinates─who hide within their castra, never meeting their prey in battle, never staring into the whites of their eyes. Why, when confronted with a heretofore unknown eikon, did we surrender the Wall to the Alliance? Because my honored father, in his infinite wisdom, has not seen fit to grant us leave to march on their lands. Accordingly, we have extended an invitation to our neighbors.
Gyr Abania is where we shall host them─the field upon which we shall enjoy the sport of kings. Patience is paramount. Cornered animals may have spirit, but they are ultimately predictable, and very poor sport. But if one dangles the promise of freedom before them, while nipping at their heels to stoke their passion, then things become interesting.
It is a delicate dance...and one which asks much of my hounds. And so I put the question to you, my fellow huntsmen: how shall we deal with these savages?

**GARLEANLEADERA:** My lord, I have a proposal!

**FORDOLA:** (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)Silence, Ala Mhigan! You do forget yourself! (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)Only by the grace of Lord van Baelsar were you afforded a place here─and that in name alone! We have no need of your “proposals,” savage.

**ZENOS:** Grrr...

**FORDOLA:** This “savage” yearns to hunt her own... The floor is yours, Commander.

**PIPIN:** Thank you, my lord.

**ALISAIE:** Excellent... The disposition of the imperial forces is exactly as expected.
I will notify Father. Cannon fire! Where did it come from?

**ALPHINAUD:** Smoke! There! Is that─ Oh gods, it's Rhalgr's Reach!

**ALISAIE:** It's no use─I think someone's jamming our communications.

**PIPIN:** You don't think... Could this be part of a coordinated attack?

**FORDOLA:** Too early to draw conclusions.
We must abort the assault and return to the Reach at once.

**ALAMHIGANLIBERATORB:** Forward! FORWARD! Give them no quarter!

**MEFFRID:** [DEATH REAX]

**FORDOLA:** You! Traitor! Kinslayer!

**LYSE:** You're no kin of mine!

**FORDOLA:** Meffrid! Hells take you!

**ZENOS:** Hurgh...

**FORDOLA:** Well, well...  Stand aside, Pilus. This one has promise.

**ZENOS:** Have a care, my lord. She's not like the others.

**CONRAD:** Hm. Do not disappoint me, girl. Or I will kill you.

**LYSE:** Seven hells... It's him! It's Zenos!

**ZENOS:** The viceroy? Oh...you are a dead man! [BATTLE ROAR]

**YSHTOLA:** So spirited...and yet so empty.

**ZENOS:** Lyse, run!

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, a magical barrier. Alas... It will not save you.

**LYSE:** How...

**CONRAD:** Y'shtola!

**ALPHINAUD:** Hold the line, by Rhalgr! Hold the line!

**KRILE:** Krile!

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud!

**KRILE:** We saw the smoke and thought we heard explosions. Are we under attack?

**PIPIN:** The imperials were all over us before we realized what was happening.
No one knew where to run or what to do─it was chaos. Lyse and Master Kemp rallied the guards and bought us enough time to get some of the wounded to safety, but I haven't seen either of them since...

**ALPHINAUD:** Confound it! If we lose the Reach, this will all have been for naught!

**ARENVALD:** Arenvald─can you escort these people to the Wall?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye, sir.

**PIPIN:** Our place is at the Reach. We must offer such aid and succor as we are able. Saving lives is now our paramount concern.

**KRILE:** If we can hold back the imperials until Father sends reinforcements, we may yet turn the tide...

**ALPHINAUD:** I'll join you. I've done all I can for these people, and you'll be crying out for a healer in there.

**LYSE:** I fear you're right. Come, there is no time to lose!

**KRILE:** What took you so long?

**FORDOLA:** Alphinaud, I need your help!

**ZENOS:** My lord, the prisoners!

**FORDOLA:** See to your men, Pilus.

**ZENOS:** Uh─ As you command, my lord.

**RAUBAHN:** Your friends were a disappointment. But you...
You will entertain me, will you not? Pathetic.

**FLAMESSOLDIER:** Seven hells...

**RAUBAHN:** Shall we give chase, General?

**FLAMESSOLDIER:** Nay. There has been enough death this day. See to the wounded.

**RAUBAHN:** Aye, sir!

**000:** You all right, lass?

**RAUBAHN:** What will you say? I think my pride might have taken a knock. Well enough. Next time, he will pay. ...

**LYSE:** 'Tis no ordinary foe could best the likes of you. Aye. I do not doubt it. To best the likes of you... Zenos is not what I took him to be.

**KRILE:** Don't you die on me, Y'shtola! Hold on!

**ALPHINAUD:** Don't worry! It's going to be all right! Alphinaud! Master Kemp is all yours!

**KRILE:** Understood!

**ALPHINAUD:** Don't just stand there gawping! You're a healer, aren't you? Don't just stand there gawping! Hold her down while I work! The worst is passed, but without the proper facilities I can do no more.

**KRILE:** Master Kemp too would be better served in the infirmary.
Let us take them there without delay.

**LYSE:** Give us a hand, would you, Lyse?

**KRILE:** O-Of course!

**CONRAD:** I know you must be exhausted, but there will be others who need our help. Leave these two to us and look to the other wounded.

**ALPHINAUD:** Were it not for the swift actions of the Scions and the Alliance, many more would have died. You risked your lives to save ours, and for that we thank you.

**RAUBAHN:** There is no need for thanks. We are allies, are we not?

**CONRAD:** Aye, just so. Let us not dwell on this tragedy, but look to the future.

**ALPHINAUD:** The future...? I'm sorry, General, but there is no future for us. We've lost too many... Gods, I can still see Meffrid with that woman standing over him... <sigh> They've ripped the heart out of us, General. They've broken us. Our fight is over.

**CONRAD:** Master Kemp, please...

**LYSE:** I'll always hate them with every fiber of my being. For what they took from us, then and now. Our homeland...our freedom...our bloody children...

**CONRAD:** You mean the Skulls... The youths who fight for Zenos.

**MNAAGO:** Crania Lupi. The Black Wolf's legacy, and our shame. A unit made up of children born to Ala Mhigan dignitaries who came of age during the occupation. Sons and daughters of Gyr Abania raised to be proud citizens of the Empire, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. It'd be easy to curse them and call them traitors, but they're our children.
Our flesh and blood! If the only way to forge the future we want is to cut down our own, then...

**LYSE:** Then what was it all for!?

**MNAAGO:** Naago...

**RAUBAHN:** What will you say to the families of the fallen─to the mothers and the widows and the orphans? Will you tell them it was all for nothing!?

**CONRAD:** Listen to the girl. We dare not suffer our comrades' sacrifices to have been
in vain. Now is the time to steel our resolve and press on, painful though
it may be.

**LYSE:** And when Zenos comes back with his army? What then? This isn't the first time, you know. You'll be hard-pressed to find men brave or stupid enough to face him again.

**ALPHINAUD:** I still can't believe how strong he was. He humiliated us back there,
the Warrior of Light included. Gods help us if he's next in line to
the Garlean throne.

**000:** Loath though I am to say it, we should not be surprised. Before succeeding van Baelsar in Ala Mhigo, Zenos led the imperial army to Doma, where he crushed the rebellion utterly. As a matter of fact, Doma remains in his charge to this day. Suffice it to say, Varis's heir is a peerless warrior and an accomplished general. The question is, how are we to contend with such a foe?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? We fight and we fight, and we keep on fighting until we win. We take the fight to Doma. I have a feeling you're about to tell us.

**CONRAD:** Come now, even you have your limits─but then...so too must he... One legatus ruling two provinces a world apart... Yes─divide and conquer. We kindle the flames of revolution in Doma once more, thereby forcing Zenos to fight a war on two fronts. Interesting... You are suggesting we kindle the flames of revolution in Doma once more, and force Zenos to fight a war on two fronts? Well...to put it simply, we have one legatus overseeing two provinces a world apart. I say we divide and conquer─we kindle the flames of revolution in Doma once more, thereby forcing Zenos to fight a war on two fronts.

**RAUBAHN:** For that, there would need to be someone left to fight on this front by the time you got back. Look, I'll not deny the plan has promise─and I feel for our brothers and sisters in Doma, truly I do─but I fear we lack the strength to
see it through.

**LYSE:** Have faith in your people, Master Kemp. Them and the Scions. Hold fast, rebuild, and when all is in place, we shall defeat Zenos together.

**RAUBAHN:** If you're going to Doma, I'm coming too. I want to help our friends there...and make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

**CONRAD:** Give us the time we need, and we will give you something far greater.

**URIANGER:** Very well. For all you have done for us, we will fight on. But be swift, comrades. Ala Mhigo has suffered enough.

**ALISAIE:** Twelve be praised! Full sure was I that I had come too late.

**URIANGER:** Urianger? Tell me you haven't come all this way just to see us off.

**ALISAIE:** Nay, my lady. Ere you quit these shores for eastern climes, I wished to share some words of seeming import. "Look ye where the sun doth rise, see crimson embers, dark'ning skies...
Look ye where the sun doth fall, see azure lost amidst the squall.“

**URIANGER:** Well that sounds suitably foreboding. Another one of your prophecies, I presume?

**ALISAIE:** Of Far Eastern origin, aye. It is mine earnest hope that this ancient wisdom may serve to guide you on your journey, for what dangers lie in wait for you upon those distant shores are yet beyond my knowing.

**URIANGER:** <sigh> A parting gift befitting your roundabout ways. Thank you.

**ALISAIE:** I have more than words for you, my lady.

**URIANGER:** It's beautiful... Is it for me?

**ALISAIE:** Though undeniably powerful, your aetherial blade taxeth you greatly in the wielding. Not so this rapier, which shall serve you just as well 'gainst all but the most formidable foe.

**CARVALLAIN:** Impressive... It feels as though it's attuned to my aether. I shall treasure it.

**ALISAIE:** Honored guests! Say your farewells, for the moment of our parting draws nigh! A fair wind blows, and I mean to follow it!

**CARVALLAIN:** It would seem our ship is set to sail. Pray give my regards to Thancred and the others. And...take care.

**TATARU:** A fine day, is it not? Fair winds and following seas.
The *Misery* is enjoying herself. Nevertheless, it would not do for you to spend the entirety of our voyage above deck. Let me show you to your quarters.

**CARVALLAIN:** Uhh...i-is it supposed to do that?

**KRAKENSDECKHAND:** Not under normal circumstances...

**CARVALLAIN:** Captain! You're needed on deck. Somethin' queer's afoot. The winds died down, the waters went still, and all of a sudden we were dragged off course...

**KRAKENSDECKHAND:** "Dragged“? By what?

**CARVALLAIN:** Can't rightly say, sir, but some of the lads are mutterin' about seein' things in the water. Things as shouldn't be there...

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, for the love of─ If you will excuse me a moment. ...Actually, might I persuade you to join me? Loath though I am to admit it,
I have a bad feeling about this.

**CARVALLAIN:** That appears to be the last of them.

**ALPHINAUD:** Word from the *Misery*. Repairs are complete, and we may resume our journey without further delay.

**LYSENARRATION:** I swear, if I never hear another ghost story, it will be too soon...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**TATARU:** By the Twelve... I thought Ishgard remarkable, but this...
We are certainly not in Eorzea anymore.

**HANCOCK:** Hee hee hee! A tavern is a tavern, Alphinaud, here or anywhere else!
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time to do what I do best!

**ALISAIE:** (-???-)Oh! A thousand pardons, my lady. (-???-)The Scions of the Seventh Dawn, I presume? I hope your voyage was not too trying.

**HANCOCK:** ...And you are?

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, yes, of course! Forgive me. Hancock, of the East Aldenard Trading Company, at your service. On behalf of Chairman Lolorito, I bid you welcome to Kugane, and invite you to take refreshments at our local offices.

**HANCOCK:** Lolorito? I was aware his interests extended beyond the borders of Eorzea, but not so far as Kugane. Regardless, I am disinclined to accept the hospitality of grinning merchants─especially those who serve a master with whom we have such a difficult relationship.

**ALPHINAUD:** My, such naked suspicion! I do hope that business with the Crystal Braves did not rob you of all faith in your fellow man. Or do you really think the chairman is plotting to drag you into another one of his grand schemes?

**HANCOCK:** I beg your pardon!?
If you are trying to win my trust, you are failing quite spectacularly.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh dear, have I offended you? Once again, I must apologize. Too much time in the Far East, you see. One is compelled to talk in circles around everything here, and one finds oneself longing for the invigoratingly candid speech of the Ul'dahn markets...though I see now that this was neither the time nor the place to indulge said longing. ...Might I suggest that we continue this conversation at the company offices? Too many eyes and ears here, you understand. 'Twould be decidedly reckless to say any more.

**HANCOCK:** If I may favor you with the invigorating candor you apparently crave─it would be decidedly reckless to follow a man I neither know nor trust. Give me one good reason why we should accept Lord Lolorito's invitation.

**ALISAIE:** Now, there's the young diplomat I was told to expect! Very well, then,
I shall explain. You understand that you are come to a most reclusive and secretive nation, yes? One whose borders are closed to foreign trade save at this single port? Then it should come as no surprise that a great many parties have vested interests here. Merchants like myself are a given, of course, but for every one of us, you may be certain there is also an agent of a foreign government. Many notable nations and empires have embassies here, you know─including, of course, the Garlean Empire, with whom you have such a...difficult relationship.

**HANCOCK:** To paraphrase, Kugane is teeming with imperial spies, one or several of whom could now be listening to our every word.

**ALISAIE:** Something to that effect, yes. Beneath this veneer of bustling trade, a war for supremacy is being waged between world powers. One might say we were standing on the front lines...just not in public.

**HANCOCK:** I still have my doubts, but he may have a point.
I say we accept his invitation─for now.

**ALPHINAUD:** Our thaumaturges took great pains to ward these walls against all manner of surveillance. Where business dealings are concerned, we do not compromise on confidentiality. You may avail yourselves of these offices for the duration of your visit.
Come and go as you like, and know that you may speak freely here.

**HANCOCK:** Your offer is most generous, but I will not enter into any agreement which would leave us beholden to you or your master.

**ALPHINAUD:** A legitimate concern. Allow me to clarify, then: the chairman bids you consider this as an expression of his heartfelt contrition for the bloody banquet and the unpleasantness which followed. Never having been one to put stock in words alone, the chairman deems the provision of material aid to be a more appropriate demonstration of his sincerity. By sheer coincidence, your purpose here also happens to coincide with our own interests. That is, assuming you are come to aid the Doman Liberation Front?

**HANCOCK:** How could─ ...Hm. I will not bother to offer a denial. Aye, you have the right of it. To be specific, we are come in search of our Far Eastern allies, Yugiri and Gosetsu, whom we hope to assist in their fight.

**LYSE:** The Auri shinobi and the Roegadyn samurai? Then you will be pleased to know that they have both come to Kugane.

**HANCOCK:** Are you sure?

**LYSE:** Quite. They came here aboard a company vessel, you see. However, they encountered difficulties securing passage across the Ruby Sea.

**HANCOCK:** The Ruby Sea? Sorry, I've never been any good at geography.

**ALISAIE:** Forgive me. This calls for a map. We are here, in Kugane. The sole open port of Hingashi, situated on her western coast. Doma, meanwhile, is here, on the eastern coast of Othard, in Yanxia. Therefore, if your friends are to reach Doma, they must first cross the Ruby Sea. Alas, this is easier said than done as the Ruby Sea does not fall within the dominion of either Hingashi or Doma, being controlled since antiquity by a third party: namely, the Confederacy. Said maritime collective is known for the consummate skill of its sailors...and for demanding that any vessel entering its waters pay a toll referred to as the “Ruby Tithe.” In exchange, the Confederacy's vast fleet “guarantees the safety” of those who travel within its territory. Now, as I am sure you are aware, Garlemald conquered Doma some twenty-five years past, at which time the Empire saw no value in controlling the Ruby Sea. And thus did they turn a blind eye to the activities of the Confederacy. The recently appointed acting imperial viceroy of Doma had other ideas, however. She has formally condemned the Confederacy and declared that any who recognize their authority shall be branded enemies of the Empire. Bowing to this pressure, Hingashi severed ties with these toll-takers and forbade the payment of the Ruby Tithe, prompting the Confederacy to make
it known that any merchants choosing to sail the Ruby Sea would do so
at their peril...

**HANCOCK:** No wonder they struggled to secure passage to Doma. What captain would risk such a journey given the circumstances?

**ALPHINAUD:** I am told your friends were not so easily deterred from their course, but I know not whether their persistence bore fruit.

**HANCOCK:** I say we follow in Yugiri and Gosetsu's footsteps and attempt to secure passage to Doma for ourselves. We will need to cross the sea in any case, and we may learn something of their whereabouts in the process. And should we find that they are still in Kugane, we can make the journey together.

**ALISAIE:** In that case, I have some information which may be of use to you. No quid pro quo, I assure you─the chairman was most insistent that I aid you to the best of my ability...

**GYODO:** He's late...

**ALISAIE:** Endless and most sincere apologies to you and yours, yes, yes.
This way, this way. Quickly now!

**GYODO:** Enough. Where are you taking us? Where is the ship?

**LYSE:** The ship, the ship... So very sorry to inform you, yes, yes.
Long before was it pledged to another. To me, to me! These ones are for Doma!

**GYODO:** <sigh> I knew it couldn't be this simple...

**LYSE:** Nothing personal, yes, yes? Just business.

**GYODO:** Then business is about to take a turn for the worse...

**LYSE:** [PUNCHED IN GUT REAX]

**SOROBAN:** Come on, let's find a way out of here!

**SEKISHINTAISOLDIER:** (-Curious Kojin-)Stay hidden and quiet. Understood?

**SOROBAN:** Clear the road! Clear the road! You there, Kojin! We seek four foreigners─one a brutish woman carrying an unconscious Namazu. Have you seen them?

**SEKISHINTAISOLDIER:** (-Curious Kojin-)Four foreigners, you say? Ah, yes! Very rude they were, making no apology as they barged past. They went that way, I think.

**SOROBAN:** Many thanks, good sir! With me! They cannot have gone far!

**HANCOCK:** (-Curious Kojin-)All is well. The Sekiseigumi will not return this way for some time,
I should think. (-Curious Kojin-)You are of the East Aldenard Trading Company, yes? Come with me.
I know a safer way.

**LYSE:** You are returned─and with guests, I see.

**HANCOCK:** Our meeting went about as well as expected. We've brought the Namazu who thought to betray us. When he wakes up, we'll see what he knows about Yugiri and Gosetsu.

**LYSE:** Well done you. When I saw the Sekiseigumi out in force, I did begin to worry, but I see my fears were misplaced.

**SOROBAN:** Actually, if it weren't for Soroban, we might not've gotten away...

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Twas my pleasure.

**SOROBAN:** Yet I must ask, Soroban: why would you deceive the Sekiseigumi to help us─foreigners of whom you know naught?

**HANCOCK:** Why, out of the kindness of my heart...is what I would like to say, but my motives are not so pure. I chanced to witness your meeting with Hancock at the tavern,
and saw an opportunity.

**SOROBAN:** An opportunity?

**ALPHINAUD:** Like many, I came to Kugane as a trader to make my fortune.
Kojin of the Red may serve the Empire as mercenaries, but Kojin of the Blue walk a different path. Regretfully, most here would rather not meet our gaze, much less do business. So I seek the custom of those less predisposed to dismiss us outright.
Namely, the East Aldenard Trading Company.

**HANCOCK:** Quid pro quo, is it? Well, there is no denying that we owe you a debt. What say you, Hancock? Will you consider doing business with our entrepreneurial friend here?

**SOROBAN:** Rest assured, Master Soroban, that in matters of trade the company does not discriminate. We would be honored to hear your proposal.

**ALPHINAUD:** I promise you will not regret this, good sir! Ah, yes─you sought passage across the Ruby Sea, did you not?
I have a ship you can use.

**SOROBAN:** You do? Well, then! Far be it from us to refuse! You have our deepest thanks.

**GOSETSU:** And you mine!

**LYSE:** Have at you! AAAHHH!

**ALISAIE:** Was that...? That was Gosetsu! I'm sure of it! He's in trouble!

**SEKISHINTAISOLDIER:** Lyse, wai─ <sigh> ...I suppose we should follow her, then.

**GOSETSU:** Victory to the samurai!

**LYSE:** Hah hah hah hah hah! How many is that, now? Ten in a row?

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu!

**LYSE:** Oho! This is a surprise! What in blue blazes are you three doing here?

**GOSETSU:** I could ask you the same thing! We've been looking all over for you─and then I suddenly heard you screaming!

**ALISAIE:** Hmm... It would seem there has been a misunderstanding.
Allow me to explain...

**GOSETSU:** ...So, in summary: you started a brawl with some off-duty imperial soldiers and were subsequently arrested by the Sekiseigumi, whom you somehow befriended and convinced to set you free if you could defeat a given number of them in single combat?

**SEKISHINTAISOLDIER:** Ten bouts for my freedom, aye!
'Tis but a pity you came too late to witness the last one. And with that, I am free to go, yes?

**HANCOCK:** Our word, once given, may not be broken─but we pray you make every effort to avoid future altercations. Circumstances notwithstanding, my lord, we are honored and grateful to have witnessed firsthand the skill of a Doman samurai.

**LYSENARRATION:** Ah. And we had just concluded negotiations.
I gather my assistance was not required?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** Gentlemen! I am told you were most unreceptive to my associate's requests. I realize you do not look kindly on the Confederacy and her ways. But if you refuse to pay the Ruby Tithe, your safety in these waters cannot be assured.

**TESHITAPIRATE:** Spare me your concern, pirate.
Your feeble attempts at extortion will not work on us. You remain at large because we allow it─because you are such insignificant little pests that we see no need to swat you. But if you wish to risk the ire of the viceroy, by all means, fire upon an imperial vessel. Give us a reason to bring the full might of the Garlean Empire to bear against your pathetic fleet.

**TANSUI:** Bastards!

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** Gentlemen. Surely the fact that you have such limitless resources at your disposal gives you all the more reason to spare some few coins for the
less fortunate?

**LYSE:** All talk, just as I thought. Come─let us away. I have no time for this rubbish.

**TANSUI:** We're all the same to them, aren't we? Savages to be ruled or slaughtered.

**ALISAIE:** They've always balked at paying the Ruby Tithe.
But they were never so eager to pick a fight... The problem, you see, is that many of my comrades in the Confederacy are of Doman descent─and the acting viceroy...well, she's none too fond of Domans, to say the least. If we take any action to hinder the safe passage of an imperial vessel, she'll accuse us of attempting to foment rebellion and brand us enemies of the Empire─which we can ill afford to be. Like the man said, we're all talk.

**TANSUI:** And where do the Kojin stand in all this?

**LYSE:** With the winning side, of course. They are mercenaries to a fault, eager to offer their services without coercion. The shellback could tell you more...though something tells me he would rather not.

**TANSUI:** I don't understand. If the Garleans are causing the Confederacy this much trouble─and if so many of you are Doman to begin with─why aren't you willing to fight back?

**GOSETSU:** Hahaha! Spoken like a true friend of the Doman Liberation Front. If you're planning to rouse us with noble words and grand promises─don't bother. We all know what the imperial army can do. Compared to them, we're boys with boats. Besides, what ties a man may once have held to his home are forsaken upon joining the Confederacy. We look out for none but our own. Be that as it may, our livelihood is under threat, and the captain will need to decide soon whether we are to go down in a blaze of glory or bow and scrape for crumbs from the Emperor's table. ...All while our friend the viceroy continues her purge of Doma's “radical elements.” I believe she's holding court in one of the fishing villages even
as we speak.

**TANSUI:** That she-devil! Her perfidy knows no bounds! She must be stopped. Come, let us find Soroban and put to sea at once!

**ALISAIE:** Tell the others that these ones have paid. We all have places to be.

**GOSETSU:** Even accounting for the rebellion, such indiscriminate shows of force seem pointlessly excessive...

**LYSE:** If only you knew how commonplace such scenes have become.
Hmm... Are we too late?

**GOSETSU:** Over there─someone's coming!

**LYSE:** ...It is she! Sworn enemy of Doma─of my master! The traitor who sold her homeland to the Garleans─Yotsuyu!

**YOTSUYU:** The viceroy herself. And look─behind her! Isn't that...?

**E3F1VILLAGER:** Filth and squalor everywhere I look. How very Doman.
What I wouldn't do for a drink... Come now, you've no reason to look so afraid! You have lived through a quarter of a century of Garlean rule, remember? 'Tis better to bend with the wind than stand tall and be broken.
Therein lies...hope. Therein lies freedom. I come before you today seeking affirmation. A heartfelt declaration. You are free to answer me as you see fit─yet even the least among you should know the correct response. Should. A resident of your village─one of your neighbors, mayhap your friend─was detained by the Kojin this morning. They say he was attempting to flee to Kugane, but we both know that simply isn't true, don't we? Have you anything to say? ...A bit slow, this one. Is there anyone more sensible among you? Have any of you anything to say? To swear?

**YOTSUYU:** M-My lady, I...I swear to serve the Empire! To do...whatever is asked of me...and never disobey...

**E3F1VILLAGER:** Well said that man. Of course...it wouldn't do to simply take you at your word. Kill him. Surely you can do that much? He must be guilty of something or other, or he wouldn't have attempted to flee the Empire.

**YOTSUYU:** I...I have a family... Kami forgive me... Kami forgive me...

**E3F1VILLAGER:** Very, very good! I've always had a soft spot for men like you. Next, I want you to shoot those two over there. Too old to work, you understand─a burden on the Empire, and we can't have that.

**000:** But...they're my parents. You can't expect me to... Ugh... Ngh... Grrraaagh!

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? ...We will show them no mercy. We can't. Not now.

**GOSETSU:** Stop and think for a moment! If you go charging in now, every one of those villagers is as good as dead! She's right. They would simply take the villagers hostage. We must consider the wider picture. If we act recklessly, we risk alerting the Garleans to our presence here, making it that much harder for us to work with the local rebels─to say nothing of the reprisals ordinary civilians would be made to suffer.

**LYSE:** Open your eyes, girl─they are already suffering! Let me go─I am putting an end to this madness! I will approach the village alone and identify myself. As a former leader of the rebellion and a known fugitive, they will wish to detain me until they are certain they have learned all I know. Use this time to make your plans!

**GOSETSU:** You saw what those monsters did to the villagers! Who knows what they'll do to you─assuming they don't kill you where you stand!

**LYSE:** We live and die at the pleasure of the kami. My fate is in their hands, and no other's. If it be of any comfort, I am no stranger to chains.

**ALISAIE:** You can't expect us to stand idly by as a comrade goes marching off to his death! And this is nothing like Kugane!

**GOSETSU:** ...Nor is it like the Reach, Lyse─or the Wall. Let him go. Hold out for as long as you can, but remember: noble sacrifices are to remain an absolute last resort. I wish I could say it won't come to that, but only the gods know how we're going to get you and the others out in one piece.
A miracle, perchance...

**YOTSUYU:** A great tower stands to the north and east. Look to its occupants for aid and succor. Together, you may yet find your miracle. Now, leave this place. I must go.

**GOSETSU:** Tsk tsk... Another idiot like all the rest. I'm beginning to think it may be something fundamental, something intrinsic, something quintessentially Doman to ignore the simple truth: you can't do a damn thing if you're dead.

**YOTSUYU:** Enough, Yotsuyu!

**GOSETSU:** Well now...this is a surprise.

**YOTSUYU:** Hear me, Yotsuyu: cease this farce, here and now, and I shall surrender myself to you. Refuse, and all shall answer to my blade.

**TANSUI:** ...Bring him to the tavern.

**ALISAIE:** Our most compassionate acquaintances return. For your deeds, we owe you many thanks. ...But something tells me our thanks are not sufficient. The strange thing is, I was certain you understood our position. And yet here you are with that same look in your eyes─and those same words upon your lips, I'll wager.

**TANSUI:** I speak only the truth. The Confederacy will not be spared Yotsuyu's wrath. You have always known this─that one day you would have no choice but to stand up to the Empire. I say to you that day is today, and come once more to ask that you join us in the fight.

**RASHO:** How convenient that recent events should lend such credence to your claims. Tell me, do death and destruction always follow in your wake?

**LYSE:** They had no part in it, Tansui. You know this. We all know this. They came and took our Doman brothers. They will torture them for her sport─murder them for her satisfaction. So we attack, and get butchered for our trouble...or do naught, and let them have their pound of flesh. If this be our choice, I say we suffer the ignominy. We endure. We survive. There is no better path. Until the day our enemy is grown weaker, and we stronger, there can be no retribution. We will wait for a sign. Such is the judgment of the Confederacy.

**ALISAIE:** So that's it, then. You're just going to abandon them. To her. They'd die for you, you know─for the Confederacy. They would die for you, but you wouldn't even think to risk your lives for theirs!

**000:** I have one last idea, if you will allow. I'm afraid it's not very good as ideas go─it's exceedingly reckless, in fact, and you may well come to despise me for ever having suggested it. Assuming we survive, that is. The question being: do you trust me?

**LYSE:** What will you say? Do you even need to ask? Ask me again later.

**ALISAIE:** We can't stand by and let innocent people suffer─here or anywhere else.
I'll do whatever it takes.

**TANSUI:** Then let us roll the dice. If it's a sign you want, we shall give you one. One rousing enough to make you drive every Garlean out of Isari without a second thought. You are wary of invoking the ire of the imperial forces stationed in Doma, correct? Know then that once we have rescued our comrade and freed Isari, we mean to liberate the nation as a whole. You will doubtless require assurances that we are capable of achieving this─and that is only fair. Accordingly, we shall demonstrate our seriousness by depriving the Garleans of a key ally: the Kojin.

**ALISAIE:** What, the three of you? Just like that?

**TANSUI:** Actually, my esteemed colleague here will attend to it on her own. But the how of it is not your concern─only the outcome. If we succeed, you help us liberate Isari. If we fail, you lose nothing. A simple enough wager─if you have the stones for it.

**RASHO:** The little miss does make it hard to refuse, does she not?

**ALISAIE:** Words are air. We will weigh you by your deeds.

**LYSE:** Is that light I see up ahead?

**ALISAIE:** [SURPRISED GASP REAX]

**SOROBAN:** We, uh...appear to be standing inside a giant bubble.
By the Twelve...I think we're on the seabed!

**LYSE:** Well, well! I thought I heard familiar voices.

**SOROBAN:** Soroban? What are you doing here?

**LYSE:** Hmm? What a curious question. I live here.

**SOROBAN:** Then this is the home of the Blue Kojin?

**BUNCHIN:** Just so. I bid you welcome to Tamamizu!

**ALISAIE:** Welcome, guests. Gratitude to you for aiding Soroban in his negotiations.

**BUNCHIN:** We thank you for your hospitality, honored elder. Pray forgive me my brevity, but I wish to discuss an urgent matter...

**LYSE:** So...you seek to compel our Red brothers to forgo hostilities for a time.

**BUNCHIN:** That's right. We know your two clans have your...differences, but what with you being...brothers and all, we thought you might be able to share some...secret knowledge...or something?

**SOROBAN:** From far above, you have journeyed here in search of our wisdom.
You shall have it. All creation is a tapestry, through which the divine is interwoven.
Kami are legion, and they can be found in the great and the small. Though they come and go as they please, they favor certain vessels.
The ancient. The precious. The exquisite. We Kojin covet these vessels, these treasures. We go forth and bring them home, to keep them safe and bask in their divinity. They bring prosperity and joy to us and our children. Yet how were we to seek these treasures above if we made enemies of the Garlean Empire, powerful and far-reaching as they are? Wiser to join with them. So resolved the Red Kojin.

**BUNCHIN:** Cautiously and carefully, for the Garleans are blind to the divine. Nor will they suffer their subjects to see. So the Red masquerade as mercenaries who seek money and power and never speak of their faith in the presence of their masters. To honor the divine, they deny it. A twisted and misguided path.

**ALISAIE:** Aye, aye. Kami will not abide such foolishness, this they shall learn to their sorrow. While our Red brothers live by the sword, we Blue Kojin uphold the old ways, engaging in trade and valuing peace. Alas, men distinguish not between our clans, and judgment for the doings of the Red falls unjustly upon the Blue. Thus do men grow more and more reluctant to deal with us, denying us our treasures. This cannot continue!

**BUNCHIN:** On that point we are in agreement. You are willing to aid our cause, then?

**SOROBAN:** There is a way that the Red may be driven to retreat into their shells. But to share with you this knowledge is to reveal secrets of the divine. Assurances must first be had. Trust forged. A bargain struck.

**BUNCHIN:** Well said, Elder! In great crises is great profit to be had!

**SOROBAN:** Delight not overmuch in such things, Soroban.
Now, tell our guests what must be done.

**LYSE:** As you wish!

**SOROBAN:** Well, I've no idea what we've gotten ourselves into, but so far, so good, right?

**ALISAIE:** It is done. Your offerings have been given to the sea. The ritual can begin at last. Come and stand before me, my friends. Yes, yes. Listen to my words, and let all else wash away. Listen to my words, and feel them flow into your heart...at first a trickle, then a flood... O kami of the fathomless waters,
Of the fallen, the ascended, the flowing, and the becalmed,
Caretakers of the shallows and of the depths... Receive of us our meager offerings,
Cleanse these ones of earth and stone, and grant them your blessing,
That they might drink deep of the divine... The ritual is complete, my friends.
You may now breathe in the depths as you would upon land.

**SOROBAN:** Strange. I don't feel any different. Are you sure it worked?

**LYSE:** ...Reasonably. The blessing does have its limits, of course. While it will allow you to dwell in the depths, it will not help you traverse them.

**ALISAIE:** I can swim well enough. How about you, Alisaie?

**SOROBAN:** Oh, like a fish. In contrast to my doggy-paddling brother. Somehow, the boy just isn't very buoyant.

**ALISAIE:** Hmm...skilled or no, your bodies are ill-suited to the sea.
Your cause demands alacrity, and you shall have it. But first, let us take to the water.

**SOROBAN:** Incredible... I could swear I was breathing air!

**LYSE:** Now, I shall summon for you noble steeds of great strength.

**ALISAIE:** Wow, look at them! I bet they could take us all the way to the deepest depths of the sea!

**SOROBAN:** And so they may─after we've won over the Confederacy, rescued Gosetsu, and liberated your respective homelands.

**LYSE:** Should you become parted from your steeds, return to me, and I shall call them again. Take care, my friends, and may the kami speed you on your way.

**SYSTEM:** We'll find that treasure in no time! Come on!

**GRYNEWAHT:** Meanwhile, in the tavern of Isari...

**GOSETSU:** [HITTING GOSETSU EXERTION GRUNT]

**YOTSUYU:** [GETTING HIT HARD REAX]

**GOSETSU:** I tire of this filthy tavern and its still filthier clientele.

**YOTSUYU:** 'Tis scant reward for your treachery, aye. A painted woman of your rich experience deserves a better class of customer.

**GOSETSU:** Name-calling? Is that what we've been reduced to?

**YOTSUYU:** Orphan of the Naeuri, widow of Sashihai─what joy it must have brought you to be revenged upon us all.

**GOSETSU:** Not enough. Not nearly enough. My appetite for your agony is as an abyss─bottomless. Insatiable. Before you die, you will cry and beg and prostrate yourself upon the earth. You will crawl on your belly through the muck and the piss, and debase yourself for my amusement. All of you. But you think you are made of sterner stuff. Hm. Rather than have him beat you, mayhap I should have my oaf go and fetch your master's head...? Poor, poor Lord Kaien─kami rest his soul! Noble leader of a fallen nation...
A fine puppet he made for the viceroy─for a time. Twenty-five years he was content to serve his masters as a dog. And then everyone had to rise up and get themselves killed. Tell me, how did it feel to fail him that day?
To live with the disgrace of his death. Not that you were a stranger to living with disgrace, of course. In the, what was it, twenty-five years since you were humiliated and tossed into an imperial gaol, you had plenty of time to get used to it. Oh yes, I heard the stories. About the samurai who would do anything to return to his master's side─even if it meant pledging his blade to his sworn enemy. They say he walked with death─that he slew a thousand men in the Empire's name. Truly a tale for the poets.

**YOTSUYU:** I do not deny my sins. But I will not be reproached by the likes of you.

**GOSETSU:** Oh, I mean not to reproach you, but to praise you! You're a survivor, samurai. Just...like...me. So let us not dwell on the past, you and I, and instead give thought to the future. To wit, I would ask you again to help me resolve this vexing matter of Doma's missing heir. Living or dead, it makes no difference really─but the Garleans are most insistent that we put this problem behind us, and I know you helped him flee. So, tell me: what became of Lord Hien?

**YOTSUYU:** To my dismay, the details escape me at present.
Mayhap your dog could jog my memory?

**GRYNEWAHT:** Get on with it! And mark me, brute: there is no limit to how far you can fall.

**KOUJINTAICHO:** Of all the bloody... <mumble> <mumble> When I get back to Eorzea, I'm going to find that little shite and I'm gonna make her pay... [STRIKING GOSETSU EXERTION]

**LYSE:** Thieves! Thieves! Come to steal our most precious treasures!
You will pay for this sacrilege!

**KOUJINTAICHO:** That's the spirit! Now don't be shy─I'm more than ready for another round!

**LYSE:** Seize them!

**SUSANO:** What in the world!?

**KOUJINTAICHO:** (-???-)Who...? Who hath made us whole?

**000:** Hark! A great kami stirs... Yes, yes, a great kami of the sacred treasures! O great kami, we beseech your intercession! We who have guarded your blade and glass for generations─your faithful Kojin!

**SUSANO:** What will you say? It was I who made you whole. If I made you whole, it was not my intent. I but carried the trinket.

**ALISAIE:** (-???-)Thou didst freely deliver our jewel unto thine enemy's own treasure vault? (-???-)Hah hah hah! How auspicious! We do commend thee, daughter of man. (-???-)Such audacity is deserving of celebration, exultation─a contest of wills to mark the occasion! Let lines be drawn! Let sides be chosen! And for their loyalty, we shall stand with the caretakers of our greater part.

**SUSANO:** Oh, perfect. A contest of wills. Just what we need.

**LYSE:** (-???-)Hahahaha hah hah hah! Hearken to us, shelled ones! Upon this day, your wish shall be granted! (-???-)Curse neither your fate nor its executor, children of man, for we are of the divine─of both heaven and earth. The ringing silence. The raging calm. (-???-)All riseth and falleth at the whim of capricious fortune. Assume your marks upon the stage, and embrace the coming chaos! (-Susano-)We are Susano, and in revelry do we rejoice!

**ALISAIE:** That...that's a primal standing in front of us, right?

**LYSE:** And a horde of angry Kojin at our backs.
<sigh> This contest is getting worse by the moment. Lyse! Help me clear a path! Leave them to us and save your strength. You'll be needing it soon enough.

**SUSANO:** Make way, make way!

**SYSTEM:** (-Susano-)Spoil not your appetite for the feast, children of man. The dish will be served, whether you will it or no! Hah hah hah hah haaah!

**TANSUI:** Meanwhile, off the coast of Othard...

**SOROBAN:** Nary a peep from the shellbacks, sir. It's enough to make one wonder...

**TANSUI:** The Red have sounded the alarum. The Isle of Zekki under attack;
fierce fighting in the stronghold. The vault breached by outsiders, and strange tales from deep within.
All this, the Red cannot ignore. Even now, they abandon their posts and flock to the isle.
The Garleans are powerless to stop them.

**RASHO:** I'll be damned. They did it. Well, Captain...wagers notwithstanding, I daresay we will not have a better opportunity to drive the imperials from Isari and rescue our men. On the other hand, naught was put in writing... But if your mind is made up, then that is that. ...I should add that if you were to change your mind, none would gainsay your decision, nor think you beholden to your past. Nor would anyone begrudge you a spot of revenge into the bargain.
Like the little miss said, we knew this day would come.

**TANSUI:** Isari may be a rotting husk, but at least the tavern keeper never watered down his drinks.

**RASHO:** Well said for a temperate man.

**GRYNEWAHT:** Hear me, comrades! We made a bargain with the Eorzeans, and I mean to uphold our end of it. I mean to remind the Garleans that this is our sea─that all here belongs to the Confederacy!  All that is theirs is ours for the taking─and take it we shall.
We will strip them of everything they hold dear!

**YOTSUYU:** This one is iron. My hands will break before he speaks.

**GOSETSU:** Ugh, kami give me strength. Are you good at anything? I had hoped this might prove more productive than blind inquiries, but I see you are determined to waste my time. Very well. Line them up. Kill one for every question he refuses to answer.

**YOTSUYU:** Hurt them, and you will get naught from me!

**E3F1GARLEANSOLDIER:** You have given me precisely that thus far, so what have I to lose? Mark me, samurai─I will find Lord Hien, be it with your help or with your heads.

**KIDNAPPEDPIRATE:** (-???-)Confederate scum! You will pay for─ Aaargh!

**YOTSUYU:** The Confederacy! They've come to save us!

**GRYNEWAHT:** And this after I took such pains to cow them. Even pirates have their pride, I suppose. Enough to march to their deaths, no less. Oh, the stupidity of it all... It truly is a sickness... I shall just have to lance the boil. Drain them of every last trace of honor and compassion... Every last drop...

**GOSETSU:** My lady, I... I'm going outside! [SURPRISED GRUNT]

**LYSE:** The kami are not finished with you yet...

**ALISAIE:** There's no end to them! They just keep coming!

**KOJINSOLDIER:** Then we must be doing something right. We have to hold out for as long as we can. She's counting on us!

**LYSE:** S-Susano is slain! Slain by the shell-less one!

**ALISAIE:** Is it true? Did you defeat him? Well, in that case─how do you fancy helping us keep the Kojin occupied until the Confederacy make their move? Speak of the devils─that's coming from Isari!

**LYSE:** I think we've done all we can here. Let's withdraw and make for the village.

**ALISAIE:** Right! Although...they don't seem keen to let us go...

**KOUJINTAICHO:** Hear me, Kojin of the Red!
We have no quarrel with you─only your imperial masters! No more blood need be shed this day! I pray you let us go in peace!

**LYSE:** You dare speak to us of peace!? Your flesh will feed the fishes, thief! Attaaack!

**ALISAIE:** Now's our chance! Don't worry about her─she can handle herself!

**TANSUI:** I can't let you take all the glory, can I?

**LYSE:** My Eorzean friends! Saw the smoke, did you? A pity you did not come sooner─though I gather you were busy elsewhere.

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu! You're alive! You're all alive...

**ALISAIE:** And full of vim and vigor, hah hah hah!
Did I not tell you I was no stranger to chains?

**RASHO:** The fighting cannot have lasted long. Where are all the imperials?

**TANSUI:** Fled. They stood their ground for a time─until it became clear that their Kojin reinforcements would not be coming. We took some few casualties, but my deeper regret is having let Yotsuyu slip through my fingers. That bodyguard of hers may be a half-wit, but he's a mean bastard on the battlefield.

**000:** In any event, I imagine all involved are satisfied with this outcome. So far as the Empire is concerned, the Confederacy attacked Isari in retaliation for the viceroy's actions─and without the aid of insurrectionists, I might add. Suffice it to say, we are prepared to be the subject of their undivided attention for the foreseeable future.

**RASHO:** What will you say? Doma shall be free. This we swear. Don't do anything reckless. So you say...

**ALISAIE:** Hm! An impossible claim, yet one spoken with such conviction that I cannot choose but believe it. Nor you. Our fates are intertwined now. If you fall, so do we. I understand. You have your doubts. We are pirates, after all, with hardly the strength of a nation. But when we saw what you few had accomplished, our hearts could not choose but stir in our breasts.

**TANSUI:** Your assistance would be most welcome. Nevertheless, we shall do our utmost to spare you undue danger─we are already in your debt.

**RASHO:** Nay, little miss, all debts are paid. For by your deeds, many still live who elsewise would not. Let both parties count their blessings, and may fortune continue to favor us all.

**GOSETSU:** You still seek to bring freedom to our people, then? You will go to Yanxia?

**RASHO:** I have faith that our allies yet live.
Once we have found them, we will plan our next step.

**TANSUI:** Yanxia was the crucible of the rebellion. What happened here pales in comparison to what Yotsuyu did there. Remember this: fear changes men. Have care in whom you place your trust.

**SYSTEM:** And with that, we must take our wounded home. Oh! Your shellback friend sends his regards, and looks forward to your next meeting. Try not to die before then, eh?

**KOUJINTAICHO:** Meanwhile, on the shores of Othard...

**YOTSUYU:** We cannot rest here for long. This place is not safe... ...Mayhap nowhere is, if thieves can breach our vaults. Nevertheless, it is our duty to protect these treasures, and we shall not fail for want of effort.

**KOUJINTAICHO:** So this is why you abandoned your posts─and without a word of explanation at that. Rather thoughtless of you, was it not?

**YOTSUYU:** Lady Yotsuyu! Pray forgive us our absence, but our home was under attack─our vaults plundered by outsiders!

**KOUJINTAICHO:** Did you even pause to consider the possibility that it might be a diversion? What is the point of contracting your services if you are not here when they are required? It is my solemn charge to bring these vermin to heel─to torment them, body and soul, until all they hold dear is as bitter ashes in their mouths. And then you go and ruin everything! ...Well, there's naught to be gained in belaboring the point.
All that remains is to administer your punishment.

**YOTSUYU:** Wait, my lady!

**GRYNEWAHT:** No...no, it's no good. There's just no joy in it. No release. There...there needs to be some investment. They were negligent imbeciles deserving of punishment, but it was hardly personal. Ten thousand such Kojin could not satisfy me half so well as a single Doman. And what do we have here? One of the vaunted treasures of the Red?
The craftsmanship is certainly impressive...
Mayhap we can use it to make amends.

**YOTSUYU:** How long before Lord Zenos reinstates me, d'you reckon? I've got unfinished business back in Eorzea...

**LYSENARRATION:** Is serving me really so unbearable?
At least pretend to enjoy it, you witless lump! If you are so desperate to earn a way back to Eorzea, then be quiet and do as you're told. And bring that sword while you're at it!

**ALISAIE:** I remember the silence. How the talking stopped when we first set foot on the plains of Yanxia. Before us stood yet another wall, and through a great magitek field we glimpsed Doma Castle.
I'll never forget the sight...or the anger I felt that day. Life. Liberty. Hope. So much lost, so much taken.
As we walked through that war-torn land, no one said a word...

**GOSETSU:** We may be in luck. I don't see a single imperial soldier.

**LYSE:** Then there is no need to remain hidden. Let us go and greet them as friends.

**GOSETSU:** I'm going too!

**E3F2VILLAGERA:** Good people of Namai, hearken to me! We come in peace and desire only information─to learn of recent events!

**E3F2VILLAGERB:** Isn't that the general?

**GOSETSU:** Lord Gosetsu!? Kami preserve, you're right! He lives!

**E3F2VILLAGERA:** I say, brothers and sisters, is aught amiss? Why do you regard me as one would a wild beast? Why is there fear in your eyes? Why do you tremble so? Ahhh, but of course! You fear me a vengeful spirit of the dead! Rest assured, naught could be further from the truth. For am I not corporeal? Are my feet not firmly set upon the ground? Hah hah!

**E3F2VILLAGERB:** What should we do? If they catch him here, you know what will happen...

**ISSE:** Of all the times for him to turn up─ Has the old fool lost his mind?

**GOSETSU:** (-Flustered Youth-)You! But... Why have you come here? What do you want from us?

**ISSE:** I know not who you are to speak thus to your elders, boy, but mine only desire is to be received with the hospitality owed a humble traveler─not the fear and trepidation one might afford a wrathful shade!

**LYSE:** (-Flustered Youth-)What? What are you going on about? Actually, never mind.
Just come with me─now!

**GOSETSU:** This is the House of the Fierce? But there are so few of them...

**YUGIRI:** Many kindred spirits remain in hiding following the rebellion. Many others gave their lives for their nation. We are the stubborn remainder. Even accounting for our comrades in the field, we are at a fraction of our former strength, 'tis true. Yet we few are patriots─brothers-in-arms, prepared to fight with every fiber of our being to set our people free.

**LYSE:** Ever are we hopeful that others will join our cause. But never did I dream that you would journey so far.

**YUGIRI:** Yugiri! Gods, it's good to see you! You look great, by the way!
Have you been here long?

**GOSETSU:** I returned but recently, having concluded my mission.
Oh, it is good to see you again, my friends.

**YUGIRI:** Did I hear aright? Your mission is concluded?
Then you have found the young master?

**LYSE:** Ere we speak of that, I would know by what fortuitous circumstance our friends came to be here. The Empire's crimes are all too familiar. Lyse─my heart goes out to your people.

**YUGIRI:** We wanted to stay and fight, believe me, but we knew it wouldn't work.
We needed more time to rebuild─and more allies to stand with us against
the Empire. So we decided to come here and help you free Doma. To show you─to show everyone─that you're not alone, and that the Garleans can be beaten, if we work together. I'd like to think we proved that in the Ruby Sea...

**GOSETSU:** That you did, Lyse, and far more besides. Needless to say, your assistance would be most welcome.

**YUGIRI:** Hear, hear! Now then, Yugiri─you must tell me of your search for our master!

**GOSETSU:** Lest you wonder, he speaks of Lord Hien, son of Lord Kaien, who perished during the rebellion. When it became clear that all hope of victory had gone, Lord Hien bade us deliver as many of our people as we could to safety beyond our borders. But as his father's heir, he was determined to fight on, and so he did─until he suffered a grievous wound in battle and vanished without a trace... Until now. For I have found Lord Hien─seen and spoken with him.
On the Azim Steppe.

**YUGIRI:** O boundless and merciful kami, the young master lives!
Tell me, was he well? Did his wound yet ail him? Where is he now?
Have you brought him back to us!?

**GOSETSU:** You may take comfort in the knowledge that he is hale and whole. However, when I invited him to return with me to Doma, he had this to say... "If Doma yet thirsts for the blood of patriots and tyrants, I shall offer unto her my blade. But if she has had her fill of bitter draughts, I shall offer unto her conquerors my head.“ Thrice did I declare to him that no true son or daughter of Doma would ever accept such a sacrifice. But for all my passion, he would not be swayed. "Learn the truth of her heart and return to me,“ he said. And so I left him.

**YUGIRI:** The words of one made to wear the mantle of leadership too soon... Yet there is wisdom in them all the same. If the people no longer yearn to be free, 'twould be folly to rekindle the fires of war.

**GOSETSU:** To suffer our master to surrender his life and forsake all hope of freedom is by far the greater folly. I will not go to face my fallen comrades having done naught to stop it.

**LYSE:** Nor I, shadow walker, nor I. But we need not rouse our comrades to battle
this day. Let us instead welcome our honored guests and allow them a
moment of respite.

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** Imperials...

**YUGIRI:** Why are you milling about like a pack of slack-jawed mongrels!?
Form a line! Now! ...Finally. I come before you today to deliver an announcement of the highest import, so listen well. While on a charitable mission to Isari village, the acting viceroy and her personal guard came under attack from Confederate forces. This brazen, unconscionable act cannot─and will not─go unanswered. As loyal subjects of the Empire who enjoy her safety and prosperity, you have a duty to defend her as well. ...There is no cause for alarm. We have no intention of sending ill-trained fodder to the front line. Those who are selected will be expected to perform rudimentary tasks. Cleaning and maintenance and so forth. You will serve only as long as you are needed. Afterwards, you will be free to return to your homes. You. You first.

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** Hmph. The Empire has no pressing need of cleaners. This is but a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate those who supported the Confederacy's actions, and isolate any whose loyalty they already suspect.

**ISSE:** And lastly...you. That should suffice for now.

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** Don't worry, I will be back before you know it. Listen to the elders while I am away, and do not play outside the village. Everything is going to be fine. I love you, all right? Remember that I love you...

**LYSE:** We thank you for your cooperation. Rest assured that this will all be over very soon─once the Confederacy has been made to pay our own “Ruby Tithe.”

**YUGIRI:** There's no telling what might happen to those people! We have to help them!

**LYSE:** And we shall. But before all else, we must needs ascertain their destination.
I doubt this is the first village the Garleans have visited...nor is it like to
be the last. I will track these men. Will you help me? Pray return to our headquarters and tell the others what you saw here.
Should we have need of reinforcements, I would know that they are ready.

**YUGIRI:** But I should be going with you! I came here to fight!

**LYSE:** Soon enough, Lyse. Soon enough. For now, we must proceed with caution.

**YUGIRI:** I know that, I do... It's just─when I saw them rounding those people up... Look, if anything happens─anything at all─you'd better call for us! I mean it, Yugiri. Anything at all.

**E3F2VILLAGERD:** Listen to me, all of you! We have dealt with the imperials for now, but you must flee this place, quickly!

**E3F2VILLAGERA:** D-Dealt with them? Oh...oh no...you didn't kill them, did you?

**YUGIRI:** Are you mad!? There's no escaping the Empire!
Running will only make it worse!

**ISSE:** To stay is to die. You know this to be true. Even if you lack the will to fight, surely you have the will to live! Or has that, too, been beaten out of you? Is this what has become of Doma!?

**WOUNDEDOLDMAN:** You are Lord Hien's retainer?
Trained to fight without fear and obey without question? Well, we're not! We're lost and afraid! We hate this─all of this─but we can't do a damn thing to change it! And trying will only make it worse. It's a pathetic existence...but it's all we've got. And when people like you come here pretending it can be different, it─ It doesn't help, all right!?

**YUGIRI:** Peace, boy. Peace. She came to help, and for that we should be grateful.

**WOUNDEDOLDMAN:** Elder, your face...

**YUGIRI:** We all have scars. Some too many to bear. Too many battles, too much lost. Our friends, our family, even our liege.
We who survived are forced to bend the knee─to sell our souls and
surrender our dignity. How are we to lift our heads when this shame weighs so heavily upon us? Your courage, your resolve... They are as salt in our wounds.

**E3F2VILLAGERD:** If they only knew what you would do for them, my lord... You have made your plight clear, and I shall impose my will no more.
But know this, brothers and sisters of Doma. For all you have suffered─for all the horror and the ignominy─you are still here. You are still alive. My lord─ My lord prays you value your life as highly as he does. As for me...I swear by all the kami in creation that I will free you from this torment.
No matter the cost.

**YUGIRI:** ...If the imperials come for me, I will tell them we were tricked by an Auri woman.

**ISSE:** Tell them whatever you must to keep your loved ones safe.

**YUGIRI:** Why would you...? After everything...

**000:** Forgive me for making you search. It calms me, the sound.
It helps me to remember the sway of the ocean when I close my eyes... Despite the many great and noble things I said, in truth I am not of Doma.
I was born beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea... To think that you were there─that you even spoke with my mother and father... They are in good health, then. The knowledge is...of great comfort to me. That I might have the strength to protect my home from the Empire, I left to learn the secrets of the shinobi. Day and night we trained, ever striving to exceed our mental and physical limits. After a time, my skills were recognized, and I was dispatched to assist the Doman Liberation Front. It was then that I met Lord Kaien and his son, and their loyal samurai, Gosetsu. Good men, all. Brave and true, so clear their eyes, so pure their purpose. Any shinobi would have been proud to serve them and Doma. ...But, in the end, I will always be of the sea. Every day, I pray for my home, and for the people I left behind.
That they might be spared the wages of war, and live in peace, untouched by this madness. I confessed this to Lord Hien once. Do you know what he said to me? He said: “Good. We are better for the conviction of our allies, and draw inspiration from their example. What is weak alone may together grow stronger.” Never did I lose faith in them. Even when all was lost, and I led our people to Eorzea, I clung to the belief that our dream would one day be realized. But when I gazed into those eyes bereft of hope─when those broken men balked at liberty, the dream was shattered.

**YUGIRI:** What will you say? Together we are strong, and we must carry on. It will not always be so. ...

**LYSE:** That you remain resolute, even in the face of everything we have seen... It heartens me more than you know. Thank you for standing by this naive fool. So I pray... And thus do I labor to see a new day dawn, regardless of my misgivings. When all is said and done, we can but carry on─together. Forgive me! We shinobi are taught to discharge our duties without hesitation or doubt. Come what may, I shall not falter. An imperial airship... It is bound for Doma Castle. Quickly, we must rejoin the others!

**YUGIRI:** There you are! What happened? Are the villagers all right?

**GOSETSU:** W-We freed them, along with many others. Gosetsu─we spied an airship bound for the castle. Know you aught of it?

**ALISAIE:** Aye, that we do... The crown prince is come to Doma.

**YUGIRI:** We suspect this is the result of recent events in Gyr Abania. Our defeat notwithstanding, there appears to be some concern in Garlemald that subversive elements may be rallying in other provinces. Though Yotsuyu governs Doma, Zenos remains the province's anointed viceroy─and it would seem he has come to assess the current situation
in person.

**ALISAIE:** If Zenos is here, we must seize this opportunity and kill him.

**YUGIRI:** Would that it were so simple, Lady Yugiri. You may recall that we encountered Zenos at Rhalgr's Reach. We have seen firsthand what he can do. His power defies explanation. He faced the Alliance, the Resistance and the Scions, and he defeated us all. We survived and learned from the experience, it is true─but if we are to defeat him, it will not be through simple opportunism. We will require a flawless plan.

**GOSETSU:** We know his strengths. A prodigious swordsman trained from childhood by the finest imperial tutors, reputed to be without equal on the battlefield. Which is why we must not meet him there. Nay, we keep to the shadows─the domain of the shinobi. And thence we strike. You need only give me the chance.

**YUGIRI:** Were this but a matter of personal revenge, I would not presume to bar your path, for I myself crave that same vengeance. But to draw steel against the Emperor's son is a grave decision, and one that will shape our nation's future. Do not forget Lord Hien's words!

**GOSETSU:** What, that we should sheathe our swords if the people lack the will to fight!? I will not squander this opportunity! If we do naught, our master's life is forfeit!

**YUGIRI:** Even should you succeed, Zenos's death will not win Doma her freedom─more likely her doom. Can we defend our people against the Empire's retribution? We few against a legion? Do not be a fool, child!

**LYSE:** ...Mayhap I am a fool with foolish dreams of a future that will never be.
But I cannot─I will not forsake them!

**ALISAIE:** Yugiri, wait!

**YUGIRI:** ...What now?

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** He comes.

**ZENOS:** The village is not far, my lord.
If it please you, we shall escort you there directly.

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** Hmph. Less a province than a graveyard. The rotting husk of a broken nation, devoid of proper sport. <sigh> But as His Radiance wishes...

**ZENOS:** Y-Yes, of course, my lord! A-And may I say how terribly sorry we are that you had to come so far!

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** We labored long to sow the seeds of hatred, of fear─to train them as beasts. Now we shall see the harvest. Let there be savage beasts baying for blood, and not hollow-eyed prey cowering in the dark, or there will be no joy in this hunt.

**YOTSUYU:** AMBUUUSH!

**ZENOS:** Shinobi!? And me without my brute...

**YUGIRI:** How weak you are. Is this the sum of your hate?

**GARLEANLEADERDOMA:** This is only the beginning! For Lord Kaien! For Doma!

**ZENOS:** [SUDDEN DEATH REAX]

**URIANGER:** Mayhap I shall test this new blade of yours. Let us hope it is to my liking,
lest your misfortunes compound. Then again, I am loath to expend such effort on the unworthy.
Come─earn the honor. Ahhh...I remember you. Ala Mhigo. The champion of the savages.

**ZENOS:** "Look ye where the sun doth rise, see crimson embers, dark'ning skies... "Look ye where the sun doth fall, see azure lost amidst the squall.“

**YUGIRI:** Oh...how right I was to spare your life. Hear me, hero. Endure. Survive. Live. For the rush of blood, for the time between the seconds─live.
For the sole pleasure left to me in this empty, ephemeral world─live!

**ZENOS:** [DEFIANT ROAR]

**ISSE:** You are not worthy.

**YUGIRI:** Get away from them, you imperial dog!

**ISSE:** No, don't... You must...you must flee!

**ZENOS:** We're not going anywhere! Do you hear me!? We're not running away! What you're doing is stupid and reckless and I never wanted any part of it,
but here we are! I've spent my whole life hating myself─for every time they made me beg,
for every time I held my tongue to protect the people I love. And then you came along and reminded me of all the things I never said and never did, and it was even worse! I would have given anything to forget, to walk away, but I knew that I'd never be able to live with the guilt. So we came─all of us! For you, for ourselves─for Doma!

**ALISAIE:** Death is death, regardless of the reason. Yet you seem determined to die, intruding upon this sacred ground, turning weapons you can scarcely wield upon me. Your lives will not even begin to redress the balance.

**GOSETSU:** How wrong you are! Go, now! Gosetsu─see to Yugiri!

**YOTSUYU:** Aye!

**E3F2VILLAGERC:** <cough> <cough> I can't see a damn thing... Someone stop them! My lord!?

**YUGIRI:** How are you feeling, my lady?

**E3F2VILLAGERC:** Much the better for my comrades' ministrations, and your most generous hospitality. You need not worry.

**GOSETSU:** Good... If there is anything else we can do for the two of you─anything at all─just ask.

**ISSE:** Stare any harder and you're like to burn a hole in them.
Go and say your piece for goodness' sake!

**YUGIRI:** I've got nothing more to say to them!
I'm going to find out how the others are getting on.

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu, Mistress Alisaie─I owe you an apology.
I acted with reckless disregard for my own safety, and endangered I know not how many others in so doing. Scorning your wise counsel, I knowingly defied our master's wishes, and left you no choice but to follow suit.

**ALISAIE:** Nonsense. I followed our master's wishes to the letter. Consider once more his words, and the intent therein. In offering his head, he but sought to shield his people from harm─loyal retainers included. You must value your life more highly, shadow walker.

**YUGIRI:** On the other hand, your recklessness did serve as an inspiration to many. Mayhap you should not be so hard on yourself... In any event, if you must apologize profusely, it seems only right that you expend as much effort thanking the one person who supported your plan from the first.

**LYSE:** That it does. There are no words which will suffice...but thank you.

**ALPHINAUD:** Aaaaaand there they are!

**LYSE:** Twelve be praised! When I learned of your rather questionable plot to assassinate Zenos, I feared we would need to recruit a new primal slayer.

**ALISAIE:** I'm sorry we couldn't be there.
Alisaie made me swear to stay behind no matter what. I think she was worried I'd hurl myself at Zenos the moment I set eyes on him.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...What? You'll forgive me for changing the subject, but now would seem a good time to discuss where we go from here. Though the Empire has yet to retaliate, the fact remains that we have revealed our presence, and signaled our intentions in so doing. It is only a matter of time before the imperials move against us. Given that we lack the strength to oppose them, 'tis plain some manner of brilliant stratagem is required. Therefore, I yield the floor to the preeminent tactician of our time, with whom I was privileged to share a womb.

**GOSETSU:** If you insist... While in Kugane we debated a number of approaches and were eventually forced to concede that we cannot look to the Alliance for aid. Even were it possible to ferry sufficient forces and materiel from Eorzea in a timely manner, such a massive undertaking would not long escape the attention of the Empire. 'Twould be a miracle if our ships reached the shore. Fortunately, according to Tataru and Hancock's intelligence, the Empire has withdrawn most of its forces from Doma in the past year, leaving her relatively unguarded. That being the case, a popular uprising spearheaded by the full might of the Doman Liberation Front may feasibly be sufficient to threaten the seat of provincial government, namely Doma Castle. 'Twould be rather easier said than done, of course, but I have seen worse plans prevail.

**LYSE:** Then we must needs meet with Lord Hien and convince him to return, for there is no surer way to inspire our people to rise up as one. He desired proof of his subjects' conviction, and they have provided it─through no less a deed than openly opposing Zenos himself!

**SYSTEM:** It will work. It has to work. And next time, we will defeat him...

**ZENOS:** Meanwhile, in the keep of Doma Castle...

**YOTSUYU:** ...I would expect no less of Bahamut's conqueror. Prepare the airship. His Radiance will not object; we have fulfilled our obligations here. I would see this prize for myself...

**ZENOS:** [HAIR TUGGED PAINED GRUNT REAX]

**YOTSUYU:** Do you understand why I appointed you to act in my stead? You, whose only accomplishment was to whisper the right words in the right ear? Because of your petty hatreds.
They render you the perfect instrument to bleed your kinsmen of hope─
to make an example of Doma, such as was ordered.

**ZENOS:** [HAIR TUGGED PAINED GRUNT REAX]

**GRYNEWAHT:** Listen well. If you yield Doma to the rebels, you will not be given another chance to beg forgiveness. Do your duty. Now. Or die with the rest of them.

**YOTSUYU:** A-Are you all right, my lady? That was uncalled for... [SLAPPED REAX]

**GRYNEWAHT:** They say your Eorzean is helping the rebels. I want her dead. I want her friends dead. I want the heads of everyone she knows and loves mounted on the castle walls!

**SYSTEM:** You mean...you mean I can finally go after her? Bwahahahaha! I've been waiting for this chance! I promise you, my lady─
she won't escape this time! Not this time, oh no!

**ESTINIEN:** Meanwhile, in the fringes of Gyr Abania...

**LYSENARRATION:** (-???-)Aye, this is the place. (-???-)...When his shade was banished, you swore to leave this life behind.
And yet here you are... Yet if this be the work of the Eyes, what choice do you have but to end it? <sigh> Or so the boy would say. Damn you, Alphinaud.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**GOSETSU:** Hey! How goes the search? Any luck?

**YUGIRI:** Ho, what fortune to meet a friend of the young master!

**CIRINA:** Well met, Cirina. If you have an inkling as to the current whereabouts of Lord Hien, we should be most grateful for your assistance.

**DOTHARLMAN:** Oh, please... It is I who should be grateful.

**ORONIRMAN:** (-???-)Hold! What is this!? I came first─you second!

**DOTHARLMAN:** Know you to whom you speak? All people of the Steppe should. Or have you fought so much that you have forgotten the face of your superiors?

**LYSE:** Superiors!? I spit on your superiority, little prince. Twisted and mad as sand devils, your kind are!

**CIRINA:** Those two don't seem to like each other very much...

**LYSE:** Those boys are of the Oronir and Dotharl. The two strongest tribes. The Children of Azim are destined to rule. So they declare to all who will listen. Their word is law─for now. Grand, flamboyant fighters...but deadly. Very deadly. He prances as a horse, as do his brothers after their many recent victories. The undying ones too are strong. Fearless and vicious, they often reigned in the past. Now, they are sorely tested. Ah, the master of the markets. He is Qestir. To fight in Reunion is forbidden, and to break the peace is to be banished forever. This he says without words, for words are lies to the Qestir.
They do not speak.

**DOTHARLMAN:** That's...interesting. And all these different tribes share the same lands, do they? No wonder it's tense...

**ORONIRMAN:** Hmph! I shall look for you on the field at the Naadam. Mark my words!

**YUGIRI:** Hah hah hah! As shall I! Mayhap I shall take eleven more Dotharl heads to make a dozen with yours. I look forward to the day.

**CIRINA:** Their dispute will be settled at the “Naadam”?

**YUGIRI:** A great battle held on the final day of the Tsagaan Sar. During this time, all bonds of hierarchy are broken. All Xaela are equal and free to prepare for the fight. The tribe which triumphs in the Naadam rules until the next Tsagaan Sar. Which, in these lands, is now.

**CIRINA:** Ah, so that is what they call the custom. I presume your tribe will also be taking part?

**GOSETSU:** Not all seek the Dawn Throne. Some are satisfied with their lot.
Others, like the Qestir, have reason to remain neutral. The Mol are lambs among wolves. Long were we content to remain apart and live quietly, but... Never mind that! You seek Hien, yes? I know where he may be.

**HIEN:** The kami are merciful! My lord Hien, I see you are alive and well!

**YUGIRI:** Ah... You are come sooner than expected. So. My blade or my head. Which would you have of me?

**HIEN:** The people of Yanxia remain loyal to Doma. I have seen the fire in their eyes─they are ready to rise up and fight. The time is ripe, my lord.
Return with us, blade in hand, and lead Doma to freedom.

**YUGIRI:** Naught less than liberty will suffice, then? A pity. It will prove far more difficult to deliver than my head. But if my people wish to pursue an impossible dream, then who am I to deny them? Yugiri! Gosetsu! And...uh...?

**HIEN:** The Scions of the Seventh Dawn, my lord─good and true friends who opened their hearts and homes to us when we fled to Eorzea. Far across the sea they have journeyed to stand with us in the fight for Doman liberation─to oppose the Empire, as they have in the West, where they are lauded as heroes for their many deeds─

**YUGIRI:** Say no more, Yugiri. Say no more. I observed how you helped Cirina, to whom I am deeply indebted. For that, and for the aid you provided my people, you have my deepest gratitude. There is no doubting your strength, nor your character.
It would be my honor to fight by your side. So. What of Doma? Arise, my friends, and tell me of our home. I have made my decision. Yugiri, I bid you return to Yanxia and take charge of our forces in preparation for my homecoming. As for our esteemed guests, I would ask that you remain here with me. I sense you will be a great help in the coming days.

**HIEN:** Your will is my command, my lord, but...how much longer do you intend to stay?

**YUGIRI:** Oh, only until I have won the contest. I mean to return at the head of a Xaela army.

**HIEN:** You mean to participate in the Naadam?

**GOSETSU:** Have you a better idea? Consider how soundly we were defeated before. The imperials may have since grown weaker, but we are weaker still. 'Twould be folly to challenge them without first supplementing our forces.
So yes, I intend to win the Naadam and enlist the aid of every able-bodied
Xaela I can! Furthermore, by championing the Mol in the contest, I can at last repay their kindness. Lest you forget, they saved me from certain death─and a man who suffers such debts to go unpaid is without honor and unfit to lead.

**YUGIRI:** Hah hah hah! Just so, just so. Our lord has spoken, Yugiri. But take heart─I shall keep him safe...and should it come to it, bring him back by force.

**LYSE:** This is no laughing matter, Gosetsu. But if these are my orders... Very well. Once more I place my faith in you. Pray look after them both.

**HIEN:** Looks like it's up to us, then... Though it does seem a bit risky. Isn't Hien meant to be the next king of Doma or something?

**CIRINA:** So they say...though, in truth, I am but a pale reflection of my late father. All the more reason to entreat your assistance. For ours is an impossible dream─to set in motion a revolution that will rattle the very firmament, and shake off the yoke of the most powerful empire in the world! Temulun Khatun, Cirina, I am returned.

**TEMULUN:** Ah, you found each other!

**LYSE:** Ours is the soil, Hien. The Doman's and the Eorzeans', too.

**TEMULUN:** You know us?

**CIRINA:** The gods know you, child...as do the stars in the heavens, which shone bright at your coming.

**HIEN:** The Mol hearken to the whispers of the elder gods, which guide us in our daily lives. We know them through the udgan─like my grandmother.

**CIRINA:** Khatun, I am come to beg a boon of you and yours. That I might liberate my homeland, I seek to rally the strength of the Steppe. To that end, I wish to fight in the Naadam─as a warrior of the Mol.
Will you grant me this honor?

**HIEN:** To stand with the Mol is fruitless! Hien, do not do this! The gods may have willed that our tribe join in the Naadam, but... There is no path to victory! We are weak and our numbers few. Even with your help, it would be impossible.

**TEMULUN:** I thank you for your concern, Cirina. But it is precisely because of the seeming hopelessness of your cause that we must needs cast our lot with you. Were we to join hands with a more favored tribe, our victory would inevitably be attributed to them. And no one would follow me to Doma.

**CIRINA:** 'Twas the gods' will that we fight. Mayhap this too is their design. Hear me, then.
As khatun of the Mol, I invite you all to join with us in the Naadam. Will you look after them?

**TEMULUN:** Come with me, friends. There is much I would show you.

**CIRINA:** You, wait. I would have words. A singular radiance. Shimmering.
Like a jewel of the Dusk Mother, blinding in its brilliance. Stars flicker and flock to you. Before such gathered light, even the secrets of the gods may be laid bare. Some are fated to rise in grace and glory. Others to falter and fade, though not from memory. Both will be your strength and salvation come the end. Cherish the stars and the light they bring you in the dark.
For you are a traveler, are you not?

**HIEN:** She needed the rest. To come so far and carry so much... Hien and his friend, too. Strange that they should vanish so soon.

**GOSETSU:** Hah! Haaagh!

**HIEN:** Not troubled by your old wounds, I see.

**GOSETSU:** Hm. Nor you by yours. I know I should have fled with the others after Father died, instead of blindly fighting on. It was reckless and foolish, and there was naught to be gained from it. Everything to lose, rather...

**HIEN:** We know no path save the one we walk. I myself am in no hurry to meet those who have gone before─not while I have still to make amends.

**GOSETSU:** Well said. [SWINGING SWORD EXERT]

**HIEN:** You are none the worse for your time in the wilderness. On the contrary,
I would say you have improved.

**GOSETSU:** Come now, your victories still far exceed mine. Or have you forgotten all the times you trounced me as a boy?

**HIEN:** I...feared I would not see you again.

**GOSETSU:** A life so fortuitously saved should be spent wisely. Without regret would I have traded it for our people's amnesty, had it been their will. Instead they have called for the sword, and so that is what I must be.
Until this blade is broken, I can but carve a path forward. ...Were you truly so concerned for my well-being?
You never showed it when we used to spar.

**HIEN:** How you cried when you lost. And when your mother tried to comfort you. And when you inevitably came at me once more, swinging your wooden sword wildly... Mina's little Master Shun. What a fine young man you've become!

**GOSETSU:** A man should not be addressed by his childhood name.
I've told you about that before! Ah, the mask slips! And I was so close to cultivating a winning persona.

**000:** There will be opportunity enough for putting on airs after you have returned in triumph to Doma. Now is the time to show our true character.

**HIEN:** What will you say? No secrets between comrades, eh? "Shun“, was it? So long as we win when it counts.

**LYSE:** Quite right! Which makes me think you should join us next time. I daresay you have a secret or two of your own to share! ...Yes, yes, 'tis a name my parents gave me as a child─but I should like to think I have long since outgrown it! But as you seem determined to bring it back into use, I believe a match is in order. If I win, you will be honor-bound to divulge one of your darkest secrets. Oh, you need not doubt my conviction. I have but one goal, to which I am wholly devoted. Join us next time, and you shall see for yourself!

**GOSETSU:** That massive monstrosity was quite the surprise, was it not? Who knew that the Steppe held such secrets! And with that, there is naught left to prevent us from taking part in the Naadam.

**LYSE:** You! Yea, you who have walked Bardam's Mettle. Newborn warriors of the Steppe. Our khan demands an audience. You will come.

**HIEN:** I remember those clothes. He's Oronir, isn't he? What should we do?

**000:** Ordinarily, I would politely decline. But this may be an opportunity to assess their strength, and we do have some time before the Naadam begins... If it all goes to plan, they will be fighting for us soon enough. What say you? Shall we go and greet our comrades-to-be?

**LYSE:** What will you say? Why not? If you insist...

**HIEN:** Whatever happens, we shouldn't keep Cirina and the others waiting.
Let's be ready to make a swift exit, all right?

**LYSE:** We accept your khan's generous invitation. Lead the way.

**ORONIRMAN:** Two banners... So it's not just Oronir we're dealing with...

**MAGNAI:** Most radiant brother Magnai. We have brought the ones you seek.

**HIEN:** You conquered Bardam's Mettle.

**MAGNAI:** As warriors of the Mol, aye. You are the khan here, yes? Why have you summoned us? Mayhap to propose a joint endeavor?

**LYSE:** Nay, Doman. We shall not speak as equals. Born of the Sun are Oronir, and born of the earth are you. When I learned of trespassers, I bade my warriors take their measure.
To flay them if they failed. But if by the grace of Azim they should survive their trials and emerge anointed, then bring them hither to pay tribute. Tribute, should it prove satisfactory, shall earn you the favor of the Sun. His beloved shall bask in his radiance, and their supplications be duly considered.

**MAGNAI:** So you want us to bow down and serve you. What if we don't feel like it? 

**HIEN:** The defiant will suffer in shadow. It would be an affront to the resplendent Azim himself to refuse this generous offer when by rights you should be condemned. But, in lieu of tribute... Swear fealty to the Sun. Pledge to him your body and soul. Promise to serve him unto death, and you may know his glory. A generous offer granted to but few...though perchance this is too merciful. Hm. It seems our brothers of the Buduga want you. The men only. Like the Borlaaq and women─though you know them not either, I am sure. No matter. All you need know is that you will serve, one way or another.

**MAGNAI:** That much does indeed seem plain. However, as we are but newborn warriors who know little of your customs, we struggle to conceive of ways in which we might be of service to the most gracious and illustrious Sun.

**SADU:** You make mock of us, Doman. Do not do so again. You will be given a task. It will be difficult. You will carry it out. When you have accepted this, you may ask me what it is.

**DOTHARLWOMAN:** How he died matters not.
Geser was a great warrior. He will return to us in time.

**GOSETSU:** Not soon enough, Khatun. The Naadam is nearly upon us! Mayhap we should counsel restraint until after...

**SADU:** I do not understand. If Geser is dead, how should he “return”?

**GOSETSU:** Silence. You come to spy on us knowing naught of our ways?

**SADU:** We know you are fearless. And that you are called the “undying ones”...

**GOSETSU:** That is true. None are braver than the Dotharl, for we do not fear death. With death a warrior must dance boldly. Fearlessly. For thus does his soul burn bright. Then, in death, his soul shines white─exalted. The flesh rots, but the soul endures. And ere the seasons have turned, so he shall return. When he is glimpsed in the eyes of a newborn, he is blessed with the same name, that he may grow into a great warrior once more.

**SADU:** You mean to tell me these newborn babes and fallen warriors are one and the same? Madness!

**GOSETSU:** I gave you leave to observe. Not to insult our beliefs. Have care what you say. Otherwise, do as you will.

**SYSTEM:** Left for the vultures... It seems an insult to the man. But the soul lives on, they say...these bodies no more than empty husks returning to the earth. Seen through those eyes, I suppose the sight
is almost comforting. Pardon me. When first I heard the tales, I could not help but scoff. “Another queer tribe,” I thought, “with still queerer customs.” Yet having borne witness to their rites, I cannot deny there is a certain logic to it all. A samurai will die for his lord without hesitation or regret.
But this is not because he delights in such sacrifice. It is because he has faith that his death will serve a higher purpose. There is an awakening in that instant, when the heart sings and the blood burns, and his soul...his soul finds peace. There is comfort in that... Nay, we dare not permit ourselves that luxury, my friend, tempting though it may be. Not while our loved ones yet remain in chains!

**LYSE:** Meanwhile, deep within the Dawn Throne...

**HIEN:** Well, if there is a way out, I can't see it. Shame we didn't learn much before they locked us up...

**LYSE:** 'Tis little wonder the Oronir won the last Naadam.
These people leave naught to chance.

**HIEN:** Hien...I've had something on my mind for a while, and now... In Ala Mhigo, where I was born, I found it strange that for all the people who supported the Resistance, there were just as many who didn't. But then we came to this part of the world, and met with the Confederacy and lots of ordinary Domans, and almost every single one of them seemed content to just put up with things, no matter how bad they got. They─they all had their reasons, of course, and it's not like I don't understand them, but...the thought of it made me so angry. After everything they'd been through, everything the Empire had done to them, how could they not rise up? How could they not fight back?

**LYSE:** ...People are pragmatic creatures at heart. They hold on to hope only until they taste true hardship. Then comes fear and regret. Safer not to dream, they conclude at last. For even should a day go by without some new disappointment, the next will only bring more of the same. And so they choose the more sensible option... They learn to abide the indignities and injustices, the pain and the shame─to accept them as normal. Such is the lot of most men. One cannot expect to spur them to action at a moment's notice. But if one who has known their pain can convince them to strive for something greater, and rekindle the fire in their hearts...then they will remember what they have lost. And they will rise.

**HIEN:** I had someone like that once. I didn't know who I was or who I wanted to be, and...he risked his life to show me the way.

**LYSE:** Then honor him by doing the same for others─with all your might and main! You know, when my homeland fell twenty-five years past, I was still in my mother's womb. Never have I known a free Doma! But my father did, as did many of my fallen comrades.
As do many of my people now. It may be no more than a dream to me, but if I do not chase it, then who will?

**HIEN:** ...The way you carry it all. You're just the same.

**LYSE:** Hm? ...As you?

**MAGNAI:** Oh, no, not me! Definitely not me. I meant the Warrior of Light. Out there, somewhere, doing what needs to be done... I won't have you put me to shame any longer... I'm going to seize the future I want with my own two hands!

**SADU:** I see you, soil bearers...

**CIRINA:** The soil has been scattered, and the Steppe reborn! Sanctified and unbound, she calls for a new khagan! Go forth and claim her, Dotharl, and bring death to all who bar your way!

**HIEN:** It begins, Grandmother.

**GOSETSU:** I must say, it's been a while... Is everyone ready?

**LYSE:** Hah hah hah! A samurai is always ready. You shall remember this soon enough once I have taken to the field.

**CIRINA:** So we take on all comers, and then it's off to Doma! I can't wait!

**SYSTEM:** Thank you, my friends.
Upon the soil of one and all shall our deeds be inscribed...

**CIRINA:** To triumph in the Naadam, you and your allies must race from Mol Iloh towards the ovoo in the distance, while fending off attacks from other tribes. Once you arrive at the ovoo, you must claim it for the Mol. But be warned that the warriors of other tribes can do so as well, and only the first will be crowned khagan. Prevent your opponents from claiming the ovoo and endure their assault to win the Naadam for the Mol!

**SADU:** Grant us favor, O Mother of the Dusk, and to victory guide the Mol!

**CIRINA:** The Steppe has spoken!? Then the khagan is...

**HIEN:** We have won... The Mol have won! The Dawn Throne is ours!

**SADU:** We did it... And you, my friend...you...you were magnificent.
Magnificent...and, uh...not a little terrifying.

**MAGNAI:** What a strange tale this is become. To think I suffered them to live...

**GRYNEWAHT:** On your guard, udgan. The wind warns of men in iron.

**HIEN:** Hah-hah! I thought I'd find you here, Eorzean! Dearest of all my enemies! Today's the day I finally get to kill you! And then they'll give me a shiny medal, and my choice of posting! Bloody perfect, it is! Well, go on, then! Kill her! Kill 'em all!

**SADU:** Dearest of all his enemies, eh? Congratulations. Hearken to me, honored warriors of the Steppe! Our enemies intrude upon this sacred ground! Have you yet the strength to oppose them!?

**MAGNAI:** You forget to whom you speak, Doman. We are the undying ones.
We are Dotharl.

**000:** If this be the will of the Mol and their khagan, so be it. The Sun shall abide by the law of the Steppe.

**GRYNEWAHT:** What will you say? Warriors of the Steppe─with me! Crush the imperials! Drive them before you!

**LYSE:** Impossible! She was there for the taking! What do I have to do!? I need more men...more weapons...more power! Graaaaaah!

**HIEN:** As if we'd lose to the likes of him! And we're only gonna get stronger. Stronger and stronger until we're strong enough to take back everything
they stole!

**CIRINA:** I have kept my promise, Cirina. They are yours to command.

**HIEN:** Oh! Yes, of course! Brothers and sisters of the Steppe! The Naadam is ended, and we Mol now claim the Dawn Throne. No demands shall we make of you save these: heed our comrades' words, and honor the law of the Steppe!

**SADU:** Before I fought for the Mol, I fought for my homeland─for Doma...

**MAGNAI:** To Doma would you have us go, to fight your war and win your freedom? Very well. The battlefield matters not, nor else the enemy.
In battle do our souls burn bright. And better the Mol's law than that of the Sun. Arrogant and foolhardy were their pronouncements. Already you and yours show better sense.

**SADU:** The Sun shall answer your call, Doman.
Wild as the wind the udgan and her brood may be, but they will deliver you naught. We will deliver you your kingdom.

**CIRINA:** [DERISIVE SNORT]

**GOSETSU:** Weak and few as we are, the Mol will fight for Doma too. If you will have us.

**HIEN:** Well then! I believe naught remains but to return to Doma at the head of a Xaela army, my lord! I cannot wait to see the look on Yugiri's face...

**YUGIRI:** Nor I. We shall depart as soon as our forces are assembled and rejoin our comrades. And then, my friends, we shall bring freedom to the people of Doma! Brothers and sisters, pray forgive me my absence. It has been far too long.

**HIEN:** Lord Hien! Gosetsu told us of your trials and tribulations on the Steppe. Would that I had been present to witness your victory, my lord.

**ALPHINAUD:** Our victory, Yugiri, owed as much to each of my stalwart comrades as it did to me. Now, rise─I will not suffer this excess of formality any longer. Alphinaud and Alisaie Leveilleur, I presume? I am told we owe you much.
It is a pleasure to meet you both.

**ALISAIE:** The pleasure is ours, Lord Hien. Though we were born and raised a world apart, our values are one and the same: freedom, justice, liberty. Each of which Doma shall soon enjoy once more.

**HIEN:** Hopefully. I understand you have brought an army?

**ALISAIE:** Indeed. The Xaela tribes of the Azim Steppe have pledged their military might to the cause.

**YUGIRI:** Good. We, meanwhile, have secured the support of the Confederacy, and a not insignificant number of your countrymen. The Blue Kojin, too, have expressed a willingness to join the fight─provided you agree to certain trade agreements following the liberation of Doma.

**HIEN:** The shinobi will render what aid they can. However, Sui–no–Sato refused to answer our call.

**ALPHINAUD:** No matter. What forces we have amassed far exceed my original expectations. You have my thanks.

**LYSE:** You should know that Zenos departed Doma not long after you left to find Lord Hien. We know not the reason why, but it would seem he was eager to return to Gyr Abania.

**ALPHINAUD:** What? Have you heard anything from the Resistance? There hasn't been another attack, has there?

**ALISAIE:** Tataru assures me they are quite well. You need not worry. If anything, this turn of events would seem to be to our advantage.

**GOSETSU:** But there the good news ends. Yotsuyu retains her position as acting viceroy, and we have reports that the garrison at Doma Castle is preparing for a massive operation... We suspect that the Empire's attempt to eliminate you on the Steppe may have been a prelude to a larger effort to purge the remaining pockets of resistance within Doma.

**000:** The hour of reckoning is upon us.

**HIEN:** What will you say? ...Then victory will soon be ours! ...But are we ready?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**LYSE:** If all are in agreement, I will outline my plan to retake Doma Castle. First, Lyse and the Doman irregulars will conduct a series of raids against imperial targets throughout the surrounding area, with the aim of drawing the garrison's attention. Shortly thereafter, our Xaela allies will launch a surprise attack on the castle's airborne defenses. In this way, we will prevent the enemy's airships from rendering support, and cut off one means of escape. Alisaie and I, together with the shinobi, will exploit the ensuing chaos to infiltrate the Moon Gates and disable the magitek field generators. Once the barrier is down, we will be free to cross the One River and reach Doma Castle. It is at this point that we must turn to our Confederate and
Kojin allies. They will commence to bombard the castle with cannon fire, while sailing west towards the Doman Enclave.

**ALPHINAUD:** Wait, the enclave? Why would you want them to sail away from the castle?

**HIEN:** Because the enclave is home to countless civilians. Once pressed, the imperials may well think to take them hostage, and I would fain forestall any such attempt. After we have secured the enclave, we may lay siege to Doma Castle directly. The main strength of the Doman Liberation Front, under Lord Hien's command, shall be committed to this endeavor, as will you and your redoubtable allies. The rest is simple. We scour the castle for the viceroy, we find her, and we subdue her. Without their leader, what remains of the imperials' morale will crumble, and they will surrender or attempt to flee. And Doma will be free. Your thoughts, Lord Hien? If any points were unclear or gave you cause for concern, I should be glad to go over them with you.

**ALISAIE:** Nay, 'tis a fine plan. You have a talent for this, that much is plain. We shall carry out Alphinaud's plan to the letter. Time is of the essence, as you know, so let us each see to our respective preparations. Carry on!

**SOROBAN:** May I present the Blue Kojin's emissary.

**LYSE:** Greetings and well met, old friends! The elder sends his regards.

**HIEN:** Soroban! It's good to have you with us!

**SOROBAN:** If, uh, you might humor me... Thank you for coming, Soroban. Doubtless you have already been informed of our plans and the role we would have your people play. However, I seek your counsel as a Kojin of the Blue. Be it by spell or siegecraft, could your forces destroy the underwater foundations of Doma Castle's outer wall?

**HIEN:** Hmm... Explosives, coupled with a few incantations... Yes, that might produce sufficient force. Such a thing could indeed be done.

**GOSETSU:** Then I wish to revise the plan. Instead of assisting the Confederacy in securing the enclave, I would have the Kojin advance upstream, beneath the water, and breach a segment of the outer wall. I mean to flood Doma Castle.

**HIEN:** My lord, the castle is a sacred symbol─the very heart of our nation!
To destroy it is unthinkable, unconscionable─you cannot do this!

**GOSETSU:** I can and I will if it improves our chances. By flooding the castle we remove the better part of their forces from the field and force Yotsuyu to retreat to the highest levels of the keep. Tell me that is not a worthwhile trade.

**HIEN:** But, my lord...that castle was entrusted to you by your father, and his father before him. I say to you again: it is the heart of our nation.

**ALPHINAUD:** Stone walls do not a nation make, my friend. Her people do.
And as long as we yet live, we can rebuild. So let us only think of this battle. Of victory here and now. For without that, we have no future.

**SOROBAN:** I see that you are resolved, Lord Hien, and I would not presume to gainsay your decision.

**HIEN:** I will inform the elder of your revised stratagem, and instruct our sappers to make ready.

**LYSE:** Our preparations are all but complete. Once we receive word from our Kojin allies, we shall set our plans in motion. We shall fight, and we shall prevail.

**HIEN:** You're awake. I was just, um... Well, they threw me out, actually.
Told me I needed to get some sleep, ready for the big day. Not long now, eh? I'm nervous, of course, but I also feel like...like I didn't know where I was going, but maybe, finally... Something's gonna change, you know? Really, really change. And when the dust has settled, we'll see what we've won...and what we've lost... I'm going to give it my all tomorrow. Everything I've seen and felt...I won't let it be for nothing. Right. Off to bed! Don't want to overdo it─and neither should you. Oh, but before you sleep, you should look in on Alphinaud and Alisaie.
Quietly, of course.

**GOSETSU:** Ho, another restless soul. Come, come─raise a glass to freedom.

**HIEN:** Mmm, good, good. I should be interested to know her thoughts on the matter!

**GOSETSU:** That's enough, Gosetsu. You'll not convince anyone with your drunken ramblings. We've talked about this. All of us. We are flooding the castle tomorrow, and that's the end of it.

**HIEN:** I know, I know! I accepted your decision, and I do not intend to go back on my word. Nevertheless, as the battle draws near, I cannot help but recall our many travails, and it fair compels me to speak... In all my time serving as a leader of men, there are two failures which haunt me to this day. The first, our defeat at the hands of the Empire twenty-five years past, and the subsequent imprisonment of your father. Long did I consider offering up my life in atonement, until Lord Kaien, allowed at last to receive visitors, called for me of all people... "For my unborn child,“ he said, ”for my dearest Shun─live!“ My second failure, of course, was the betrayal of that selfsame command, when in the rebellion I failed to protect not only Lord Kaien, but Lord Hien too... That I yet live, having known such disgrace, is an affront to the kami themselves... Yet you...all of you...saw fit to grant this shameful creature, this failure, another chance...to serve a greater purpose... Thank you...for pitying an old fool...

**YUGIRI:** Now, now, it is far too soon for that. Save your tears for the morrow. You may be sure we will have ample cause to shed them, be they for joy or despair. Bah! Even that sounds morose. We who yet walk the path should not think too much on the destination. When the hour arrives, we shall welcome what comes with open arms. He is right about one thing, though─we have you and yours to thank for this chance. All debts will be repaid. On that you have my word. But first, we must live past tomorrow, no? If you've no intention of sleeping, Yugiri, you may as well join us.

**LYSE:** Forgive me, my lord. I did not mean to, uh... If that is your will...

**ISSE:** Understood. Wish us luck. Right, you all know what you have to do. Are you ready?

**LYSE:** Oh, yes. Ready to show them what a good job they made of breaking us!

**E3F2GARLEANSOLDIER:** Then what are you waiting for? Move out!

**LYSE:** Why must we waste our time guarding this blasted... Hm? Sound the alarum! Fluminis is under attack! Armed insurgents have breached the perimeter! We need reinforcements! [KNOCKED OUT REAX]

**MAGNAI:** This is Lyse. Imperial forces converging on our position. Looks like we've got their attention. We'll be sure to keep them busy for as long as we can!

**SADU:** Ahh...war. To wield power, to make men kneel before you.
There is no better feeling. A pity I must share this pleasure with a feral dog of a Dotharl!

**MAGNAI:** Preening, Oronir! You fear that she will put the Sun in shade! Those are for you. Go. Claim your prey.

**SADU:** [SWINGING MASSIVE AXE EXERTION GRUNT]

**MAGNAI:** Bwahahaha! Come to me! Come to your death! With each that falls, my soul soars higher!

**HIEN:** Swiftly, brothers! Fall not behind!
Make an offering of their steel to Father Azim!

**GOSETSU:** They seem to be enjoying themselves...

**YUGIRI:** My lord! The barrier!

**ALPHINAUD:** That it should fall so soon!
Truly, our allies seem determined to surpass each other!

**YUGIRI:** The magitek field is down. I repeat, the magitek field is down!
Confederate vessels, you are clear to advance upon the enclave!

**HIEN:** The wall is breached! The Kojin, too, will not be outdone!

**E3F2GARLEANMESSENGER:** Our allies have set the stage. Now we must take the castle. With me!

**YOTSUYU:** My lady, the riverside wall has been breached! The lower levels are already flooded, and the water is still rising!

**E3F2GARLEANMESSENGER:** So I gathered. He would tear the whole thing down...all for the promise of freedom. A noble sacrifice...or the last desperate flailings of a fool. Speaking of which, how fares my brute?

**YOTSUYU:** Th-The procedure was carried out as instructed by Lord Aulus.
By all indications...it was a success.

**E3F2GARLEANMESSENGER:** Is that so? Then he may yet be of some use. Devotees of vengeance should rightly pursue their cause unto the bitter end, don't you think? Their hearts aflame with passion until the last few embers fizzle and fade, leaving naught but ash... The viceroy's orders were clear. If Doma falls, none shall be spared his wrath. Tell the men to fight as if their lives depend on it. Because they do.

**YOTSUYU:** A-As you command, my lady!

**HIEN:** Again they come to make you kneel. To make you grovel and suffer. But you have endured their worst and survived. You know their tricks.
They will not find a flower simply waiting to be plucked...

**YOTSUYU:** Have you aught to say for yourself?
For what you have done to our people─your people?

**YUGIRI:** My people, he says.
The precious lordling beloved by all come to confront the wicked witch. My parents thought me no better. They worked me from dawn to dusk, like an ox or an ass or some other beast of burden. Until, that is, my brother spied a chance to transform the family fortunes. And so I was married to a vicious old drunk who beat me as he pleased, and when I pleaded for help, I was told to grin and bear it. For the family. For him. For everyone's sake. They pretended not to notice, but they knew.
They knew. What did it matter? I was nothing to them─less than nothing! I wasn't of their flesh, I wasn't a fellow Doman, I wasn't even a person. I might just as well have been dead! And then my husband passed away one day. And so I was sold off yet again,
to pay his debts. But this time, this time, I found a way to live for myself.
To survive. As a spy for the Empire. Oh, those were the days, when the scales first fell from my eyes. No longer would I be a slave to my parents or my husband or the pleasure house.
I would be free...and receive due compensation... That would be enough, I thought...until I saw a Doman in the road, beaten and broken, and my heart...my heart skipped a beat... Lying at my feet, groaning in agony, sobbing in despair. Powerless, helpless, hopeless! A vision forever seared into my soul... Hah! There was nothing I would not do to feel that joy again! To bend this cruel, twisted world to my whims!
...Now, having borne witness to my life's work, have you aught to say to me? Heh heh... 'Twas kind of you to lend me your ear, my lord. But now it is time for us to conclude our little tête-à-tête with a final game of chance... Who shall stand, and who shall fall? Let the die be cast.

**HIEN:** This was her plan from the first─to bring the keep down on our heads!

**GOSETSU:** I will remember your words. We must flee! Order our forces to withdraw!

**YUGIRI:** Go, my lord...while you still can. I cannot hold this forever.

**GOSETSU:** No! We will not leave you behind!

**YUGIRI:** Do your duty. Deliver Lord Hien and the others to safety. Now, forthwith!
I shall manage on my own.

**YOTSUYU:** Gosetsu!

**GOSETSU:** No...no one leaves... Not you or anyone else...

**000:** ...'Tis naught this old frame cannot bear! Go now, all of you! The day is won! And the morrow beckons!

**GOSETSU:** What will you say? ...Thank you. This isn't over!

**HIEN:** Nay, thank you. For granting me new purpose...and a measure of peace. Do not despair, my friend. Never before have I felt so alive.
My eyes unclouded, my purpose clear. This is right.

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu... You never failed us. Not once. You served my father faithfully, and I am a better man for your guidance. And the Doma we build together shall be better for it too! Be proud, my friend. Be proud.

**CIRINA:** I am, Shun. More than you know.

**YOTSUYU:** Hien! Hien!?

**GOSETSU:** [BITTER WEEPING]

**CIRINA:** You cast the die. Gambling was never my vice.

**HIEN:** How merciful the gods that I should find you in time... Gosetsu!? W-We must turn back now, before it is too late!

**CIRINA:** Eyes forward, Cirina. That was his wish.

**RASHO:** ...I will deliver you to safety. The others are waiting.

**HIEN:** We brought everyone here. You are the last to arrive.

**RASHO:** I see. Thank you. We owe the Confederacy a great debt...

**E3F2VILLAGERD:** I have waited twenty-five years for this moment. You owe us naught.

**E3F2VILLAGERC:** Look! It's Lord Hien!

**E3F2VILLAGERB:** Lord Hien!

**WOUNDEDOLDMAN:** It's him!

**YUGIRI:** He lives, he lives!

**HIEN:** Some few words of encouragement would not go amiss, my lord.

**000:** Um... Right! Uh, yes. O-Of course...

**HIEN:** What will you say? Off you trot, then. You're their lord, remember. Stand tall! Well, if you won't say something, I will.

**E3F2VILLAGERC:** Ummm... Er, um...right, um, right! Off─off I go! Forgive me. This is rather more daunting than I had anticipated.
But you are right, I must be strong. Wish me luck. Hah hah! Hearing you say that, I find my courage somehow renewed.
Much obliged. We are a sorry lot, are we not. Tired, dirty, stinking of blood and sweat and ash. A people pushed to the point of breaking. And yet we won. The perseverance to endure decades of oppression. The will to carry on the legacy of those we have lost. These were the bonds that held us together and gave us the strength to reclaim our home. After twenty-five hard years, the shadow of the Empire no longer darkens these lands, and we may at last look forward to the dawning of a new day. But, my friends, it will be a day of work. So I ask you: have you yet the strength to stand? To rise up with me once more, here and now, and begin to rebuild our homeland?

**E3F2VILLAGERD:** Lord Hien!

**E3F2VILLAGERB:** Doma! Doma!

**ISSE:** Kami be praised...

**ALISAIE:** [STIFLED TEARS]

**LYSE:** This will not end with Doma. We will see to that. Right, Lyse?

**ALPHINAUD:** Right!

**TATARU:** Indeed, this is but the beginning. The tide is turning, and it shall soon bear us back across the seas, and onward unto the next battlefield.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, there you are! All packed and ready to go?

**TATARU:** To the best of my knowledge, yes. Apologies for the wait. The task of tying up loose ends invariably takes longer than one allows. Happily, however, all now seems to be in order.

**ALISAIE:** Then there's nothing left to do but to board the ship! Do try and enjoy the journey, won't you? It may be your last chance to rest for a while!

**ALPHINAUD:** That would depend on the good captain's choice of route.

**ALISAIE:** As ever, Tataru, I pray you take all due precautions while making your inquiries. Better to avoid the local authorities altogether than risk a repeat of our Ishgardian episode.

**ALPHINAUD:** And what sordid episode is this, pray tell?

**HIEN:** Naught to speak of, I assure you...

**LYSE:** (-???-)You there! Hold that ship!

**HIEN:** What are you two doing here? Shouldn't you be in Doma?

**YUGIRI:** Shouldn't you? You left with nary a word! I half-wondered if I had done something to offend.

**LYSE:** Upon learning that you had departed for Kugane, we immediately resolved to give chase. Our comrades can manage affairs in our absence, and it seemed the least we could do.

**HIEN:** You mean you came all this way just to say good-bye?

**ALPHINAUD:** That too, aye, but there was something else I felt I had to say. You helped us win our freedom, and for that I cannot thank you enough. Accordingly, after we have established an interim government and so forth, I think it only meet that we repay the favor by dispatching our own forces to Eorzea. If you would have us.

**HIEN:** We harbored no expectations of such generous aid...and as there is no telling when the Empire might strike back at you, would it not be wiser to concentrate your resources on the defense of Doma?

**ALPHINAUD:** I had a mind to pursue a more aggressive defense. To wit, we will send forth shinobi to provinces far and wide to spread word of our victory, that we might inspire others to take up arms as we did. Even the Empire has its limits. If the Garleans cannot be certain where and when the next rebellion will take place, how can they commit another force to Doma? And besides...so long as this debt remains unpaid, how am I to face myself? And Gosetsu?

**HIEN:** As you wish. I will relay your offer to the Eorzean Alliance.

**LYSE:** All of Doma is counting on you to finish what we have started. You have it in you, Lyse, to seize the future you want. Never forget.

**HIEN:** I won't, Hien─not your words or anything else. Everything that led us here, that will drive us forward─I'll carry it with me, always. And that's a promise.

**YUGIRI:** Hah hah! I will hold you to that! Go with them to Eorzea. Tell their people of our triumph, and of our pledge to stand with them.

**TATARU:** By your leave, I shall pave the way for our new alliance.

**HIEN:** Hurry up, you lot! The ship's about to weigh anchor!

**SYSTEM:** It seems our time is at an end. Go well, my friends...and may we meet again beneath a western sky.

**GARLEANLEADERC:** Meanwhile, in the Royal Palace of Ala Mhigo...

**GARLEANLEADERA:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)I always knew that woman was unfit for command...

**ZENOS:** (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)Aye. When you think of all the resources we poured into that hole.
And for what?

**FORDOLA:** The beast yet lives. Mayhap it is time I sharpen my claws. I wonder, will you walk into my parlor once more...?

**KRILE:** Fordola rem Lupis, come at the command of the lord viceroy to present the prisoner taken by the Crania Lupi!

**ZENOS:** Zenos yae Galvus, I presume? It's true what they say. You do have the eyes of a monster.
A ravenous, insatiable fiend.

**GARLEANLEADERD:** You. Give the Butcher your weapon.

**FORDOLA:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)My...? Yes, my lord!

**ZENOS:** My lord, this is─

**FORDOLA:** A reward given in recognition of your service. I trust you will prove more capable than its former owner.

**ZENOS:** I...I swear I'll not disappoint you, my lord!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALISAIE:** Pray join me in welcoming our Scion allies, but recently returned from their mission to the Far East. We have been most eager to hear a firsthand account of your time there, eventful as we understand it was.

**RAUBAHN:** Very well, allow me...

**CONRAD:** ...Such victories are rarely won without sacrifice. But the prize is worth the price. Doma free, after all these years.

**PIPIN:** Bloody hells... Flooding their own castle for a better chance at victory...
We could learn a thing or two from that lad.

**RAUBAHN:** Our agents report a flurry of communications between Garlemald and Ala Mhigo in recent days. 'Tis plain they are in the midst of deliberating their response to the Doman uprising.

**CONRAD:** Good. Every imperial unit in occupied territory will be on the lookout for civil unrest. The fear of leaving critical locations undefended will make commanders think twice about committing their forces─giving us a chance to seize the initiative.

**PIPIN:** We have a chance, aye─mayhap the last one we're ever gonna get.
While we've done our best to rebuild the Resistance, the imperials have only increased their efforts to root out sympathizers. If we keep on playing for smaller prizes, it's only a matter of time before they crush us again. And that we won't come back from.

**RAUBAHN:** A swift advance seems best for all concerned. Not least poor Mistress Krile.

**CONRAD:** Then let us waste no more time.
The campaign for Ala Mhigan liberation begins now! Our first objective will be to capture Castellum Velodyna. Take the bridge,
and the whole of the Fringes will be ours. From there, we can push east
towards the Peaks. I name this operation Rhalgr's Beacon. For as Rhalgr once sent His star to guide our ancestors to these lands, so too shall it see us home!

**MNAAGO:** It's begun, then.

**LYSE:** Good. It's the waiting that drives me mad. Standing around, knowing what's to come. I'll never get used to it.

**MNAAGO:** Calm down, Naago. You're making her nervous. We've come this far, haven't we? We just need to make it the rest of the way!

**CONRAD:** Right!

**MNAAGO:** Looks like the bastards went for the bait. The bridge is ours for the taking! Now remember, M'naago: I want you to make for the tower as soon as you see an opening and get that flag flying. We'll see to the fighting.

**CONRAD:** I won't let you down, sir!

**FORDOLA:** Come, then! Rhalgr's star shall burn bright this day!

**LYSE:** Gods damn you!

**CONRAD:** No more running. No more hiding. Let's finish this! Look! The flag!

**ARENVALD:** The bridge is ours! Ala Mhigo, Ala Mhigo, Ala Mhigo!

**ANANTASOLDIER:** [RALLYING CRY]

**FORDOLA:** [RALLYING CRY]

**RAUBAHN:** Stand your ground! It's not over yet!

**G3F1IMPERIALCENTURION:** [LOUD ROAR] Hark you, brothers and sisters! The bridge is ours!

**RAUBAHN:** Velodyna is fallen!? Impossible!

**G3F1IMPERIALCENTURION:** We have them on the run! Forward! No mercy!

**SKULLSOLDIERC:** Regroup, regroup... We have to regroup! All units─ Fall back!

**FORDOLA:** Commander! The 4th Cohort has been routed! We'll be at the mercy of the enemy's reinforcements if we don't fall back now!

**SKULLSOLDIERC:** Idiot! We have the stronger force by far! Don't be taken in by their tricks!
Or would you rather tell Zenos you lost to this rabble!?

**FORDOLA:** No, but if the snakes betray us in the confusion, we'll have no way out!
I'm begging you, Commander─give the order, or we'll all die here!

**LYSE:** ...As common traitors who drank of muddied waters. For all the good it did us. Skulls, with me! The day is theirs, and so is this bastard bridge.
Someone bring the snake!

**CONRAD:** Damn it!

**LYSE:** Let them go, Lyse! We've done what we came here to do.
That's enough for now.

**MNAAGO:** ...I suppose. It's our first victory, isn't it? And that has to be worth something.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, you've come. Welcome, friends, to my village. My home.

**MNAAGO:** How fare your people?

**LYSE:** Good, all things considered. Better than the Ananta, at any rate...
They've sent an emissary. I'll take you to her.

**VIRASOLDIER:** We're here to help. Will you tell us what happened?

**MNAAGO:** Aye. It began with a quarrel between the imperials and the Qalyana.

**VIRASOLDIER:** The Qalyana are another Ananta tribe─the strongest and the most influential. Unlike the Vira, they want no part of our troubles. They swore fealty to the Empire and were content to remain within their borders.

**LYSE:** Jussst ssso. The Qalyana forsssook their pride and the fight, and yielded to Garlemald long ago. But then a new commander was sssent to hold the black bridge.
She demanded the Qalyana sssurrender a hossstage, thisss Butcher.

**VIRASOLDIER:** Fordola. It doesn't make sense, though... The Vira are the ones working with the Resistance. Why would she threaten the Qalyana?

**ALPHINAUD:** Because she is ignorant, like all imperials. She knows not the difference between Qalyana and Vira, nor does she care to learn.

**VIRASOLDIER:** I see. All Fordola knew for sure was that the Resistance would come from
the west. She reasoned, therefore, that if the Ananta on the east bank turned their coats, she would be trapped. I take it the Qalyana had no choice but
to oblige her.

**LYSE:** No, they did not. The imperials left with the Qalyana broodmother's own daughter, Anamika. Long days and nightsss she looked out on the black bridge, weeping for her child. Until you came. The broodmother knew at once which way the winds would blow. She and her warriors met with the fleeing imperials in the road and demanded that her daughter be returned.

**VIRASOLDIER:** Bad idea... Fordola's not the kind to take threats lying down.

**ALISAIE:** You know her well. The Butcher turned her blade to Anamika and bade the Qalyana move aside. But the broodmother would not yield.

**VIRASOLDIER:** I know where this is going...

**ALISAIE:** The Qalyana sssurrounded the imperials, one of whom, whether out of fear or ssstupidity, cut the child down. There was naught that could be done.

**VIRASOLDIER:** What madness...

**ALPHINAUD:** The true madnesss was yet to come. For in her dessspair, the Qalyana broodmother cried out for her daughter to be ressstored to life.
She bessseeched Sri Lakshmi's intercession.

**VIRASOLDIER:** She summoned a primal, then and there?

**ALISAIE:** That she did, if only for an inssstant. Bereft of courage and honor,
the broodmother sssought sssolace in her faith. The imperials fled in terror at the sssight of the goddesss, abandoning these lands to the Ananta... Now the Qalyana bid usss make pilgrimage, to pay proper ressspectsss.
Yet though we Vira revere Sri Lakshmi as the holiessst of the holy, we will not prossstrate ourssselves before Her.

**VIRASOLDIER:** And so you turned to us.

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye. All who have fought with the Resissstance have heard tell of the warrior. The eikon-ssslayer.

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** I believe we have heard enough. Inconvenient though the timing may be, if a primal has indeed been summoned, we can scarce afford to ignore it.
We must needs discuss how best to resolve this situation.

**LAKSHMI:** Why, Missstresss... Why does my Anamika ssslumber ssstill?

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** Look thee on her face, sssupplicant. Thy prayer hath been anssswered. Flesh sssundered hath been made whole. Blood ssspilt runneth through her veins. Breath ssstolen filleth her breassst.

**LAKSHMI:** But she hears not her mother's words, nor sssees her mother's face!
She...she is sssilent...and empty...

**ALISAIE:** Only the vesssel may be remade. Not so the flame which flickered within.
Her soul hath been scattered to the four winds.

**ALPHINAUD:** Now do you see her promises for what they are!?

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie! Have you gone mad!?

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** Mayhap I have! But I refuse to stand by and watch yet another tragedy unfold!

**ALISAIE:** Who intrudes upon thisss sssacred ground!? Imperials thirsssting for blood!?

**LAKSHMI:** No! We come not to shed blood but to save you from the false god who would lead you astray! I understand how you feel, I do. You loved her with all your heart, but when the moment came, you still couldn't save her. The anguish, the anger...
I know it only too well. But I also know where this path leads! To embrace a primal is to condemn yourself to an endless cycle of despair. You will never know peace!

**ALISAIE:** A worm-eaten heart may find peace and ssserenity in ssservice. In beauty and grace. Thisss hath ever been my promissse. Naught elssse.

**LYSE:** You tempt them with visions of things that can never be, and leave them bereft and wanting! No illusion, however sweet, can change the fact that your daughter is gone. Remember her as she was! Do not suffer this piteous shade to tarnish her memory!

**LAKSHMI:** For every prayer that primal “answers,” it'll demand payment in kind. Do you have any idea how many more Ananta will die to feed its hunger for crystals!?

**LYSE:** They would have thee sssuffer man's ssspite and live in fear. Far better to dwell in my beauteousss dream than endure ssso ugly a reality.

**LAKSHMI:** She's wrong! We hate the Empire as much as you! If you'd just listen─

**ALISAIE:** Poor, misssguided children. I would ssspare you the tormentsss of thisss cruel and misshapen world. Come, basssk in my radiance. Let it fill your heartsss and free you from your burdens.

**LAKSHMI:** [FRUSTRATED GRUNT]

**LYSE:** Abide in misery then, fools. The Ananta are more deserving of my blesssing... Leave these lands and my dreamers be. I will not warn you a second time.

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** You did it again. You saved them. I just wish I could've been more help... So...it looks like the Ananta did have a mountain of crystals after all.
Like every other tribe. Gods, we're all such slaves to our weaknesses...

**LYSE:** You! You ssslew our Missstresss! She was our hope, our sssalvation!
Is there no end to your cruelty!?

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** Listen to me, please! I know that you're only trying to protect yourselves because you feel frightened and alone... But that's how we all feel, don't you see? If we could just turn to each other for help instead of the gods, I'm sure we could find a way to live in peace! Your crystals are important to you, aren't they? Reflections of your souls, right? Well, you shouldn't have to sacrifice something so precious to a primal...

**LYSE:** Who are you to quessstion our choice? You who fight without fear? We wish only to live in peace, and if thisss be the price we must pay, then ssso be it!

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** I know there's nothing I can say to convince you. But I hope that one day you look back and see we only ever wanted the same thing.

**LYSE:** Begone, damn you! Ssspare me your hollow words and leave me to mourn. 

**SYSTEM:** I'll go...but it doesn't mean I'm giving up. Gyr Abania is our home too, and one way or another, we're going to have to learn to live together. Come on. Alphinaud and Alisaie are waiting.

**GARLEANLEADERA:** Meanwhile, in the Royal Palace of Ala Mhigo...

**GARLEANLEADERC:** (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)Ah, the savage returns. And with her tail firmly between her legs.
Beaten by beastmen, I hear.

**GARLEANLEADERA:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)'Twas a shameful display, by all accounts. She may have curried the viceroy's favor with her bold promises, but in the end, she's just another plodding bungler like the rest of her kind.

**GARLEANLEADERC:** (-Imperial Tribunus Militum-)Strange, you would think him a better judge of character. Then again, I hear she's not averse to a more physical mode of persuasion.

**FORDOLA:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)Hah, I thought she rose through the ranks rather quickly. But no longer. If only she had been content with her lot, she might have lived to see the morrow.

**ZENOS:** Fordola rem Lupis, commander of the Crania Lupi, reporting as ordered.

**FORDOLA:** ...Why do you tremble so? Could it be that the Empire's Butcher is afraid? That she who walks with death is terrified of her own?

**ZENOS:** I am terrified of dying having achieved naught. Gladly would I give my life to win a great victory on the battlefield, had I but the strength.

**FORDOLA:** Alas, you do not. Indeed, you are weak. And born of this weakness is a blind fervor. A raging inferno which threatens to consume not only you, but everyone around you.

**ZENOS:** Yes, my lord.

**FORDOLA:** You were defeated by the Resistance on several occasions.
You misjudged the Ananta and spurred them into summoning an eikon.
Have you anything to say?

**ZENOS:** I do not, my lord. My failures are my own.
I am prepared to accept your judgment.

**FORDOLA:** And that is very admirable. However, I've had enough of this dumb show. Give voice to that hunger I see in your eyes, or I will pluck them from your head.

**ZENOS:** I...I want... I want to make them pay! All of them! Everyone who ever mocked or looked down on me─I want the power to make them pay!

**FORDOLA:** ...Hm. Very well. Then I shall give you a chance. A chance to transcend your mortal limits. Assuming, that is, you are prepared to wager your life for such power.

**LYSENARRATION:** Transcend, my lord...? I came here prepared to die. Tell me what I must do.

**SYSTEM:** I remember how they laughed. Alliance and Resistance soldiers,
eager for battle, trading jokes as we marched east towards the Peaks... Beyond this last line of defenses lay the Lochs and the city. Breaching it would be no small feat. But we beat the imperials back, just like that, and we liberated a village. The first of many...

**FORDOLA:** Meanwhile, deep within an imperial research facility...

**ZENOS:** My...my head...

**FORDOLA:** Let us see... So...she lives. Impressive...or merely lucky.
Though that too may prove a useful trait.

**DRUSUS:** My lord...what have you done to me...?

**FORDOLA:** Though we Garleans are intellectually and physiologically superior in almost all respects, we lack the hereditary traits required for the reliable manipulation of aether─hence our unique inability to wield magicks. This deficiency, for want of a better word, saw us subjected to decades of oppression by the lesser races, and we were eventually driven to seek shelter in the cold northern reaches of Ilsabard. Fortunately, said region was replete with vast deposits of ceruleum, which proved instrumental in the development of magitek: a revolutionary technology conceived to compensate for our disadvantage. It was with magitek that we grew strong─that our nation became an empire. Yet ultimately, this was an extrinsic solution to an intrinsic problem. What I wanted was not a crude device to be used in lieu of magic. Through modification of the Garlean genome, I argued that it might be possible to enhance a subject's ability to manipulate aether, effectively empowering them to wield magicks. Alas, my theories were met with consternation in the imperial court.
Only Lord Zenos, with commendable foresight and wisdom, deigned to support my research.

**ZENOS:** ...You gave me this treatment? But I'm not Garlean.

**DRUSUS:** Ala Mhigan, through and through. What you have been granted is far greater than mere magic. Before that lesser light, it is as a second sun.

**ZENOS:** I am informed that Ala Ghiri was recently occupied by the Resistance, and that an attack on Specula Imperatoris is considered imminent. This could provide an ideal opportunity to test her performance in the field.

**FORDOLA:** Your...Skulls, was it? They have joined the garrison at the watchtower?

**ZENOS:** ...Yes, my lord. By your leave, I would rendezvous with them and lead a counterattack against the insurgents.

**THANCRED:** No. Even were you to leave now, you would not arrive in time.
There is another duty I would entrust to you...

**RAUBAHN:** ...Found you.

**PIPIN:** Ho! You've improved, lad!

**RAUBAHN:** Come now, Father. You lured the fool onto my blade, and do not try to deny it!

**PIPIN:** Our work here is all but done. What of Conrad and his men?

**RAUBAHN:** They are for the main tower. The Skulls have offered fierce resistance thus far, but Conrad seems to believe he can convince them to lay down their arms...

**FORDOLA:** Then we will tend to the stragglers down below. With me!

**GARLEANOFFICER:** Report.

**FORDOLA:** Enemy forces have overrun the lower facilities, and appear to be mounting an assault on the main tower. We have already received a request for reinforcements. A unit of legionaries has been mustered and is ready to depart.
They await your orders, Commander.

**GARLEANOFFICER:** Stand down.

**FORDOLA:** Commander?

**GARLEANOFFICER:** Tell them to stand down.

**FORDOLA:** Commander, if I may! Our people─your people are still in there!
They will be slaughtered!

**GARLEANOFFICER:** You think I don't know that!? I want nothing more than to help them─to lead the bloody charge─but I have my orders! Lord Zenos said no reinforcements. He would have us use the main cannon to destroy the installation.

**FORDOLA:** What...kill our own soldiers!? You must be mistaken!

**GARLEANOFFICER:** Mayhap you'd like to ask Lord Zenos yourself? I thought not. Initiate the firing sequence. Wars are won on the backs of the dead. Theirs and ours. There is no truth but this. We must remain firm and resolute, and always, always do our duty.
Now, give the order!

**GARLEANHARPOONER:** Initiate firing sequence!

**FORDOLA:** Aye, aye, initiating firing sequence!
Release safety locks...deploy main cannon!

**GARLEANOFFICER:** Ansfrid, Hrudolf, Emelin...
For us. For our people. For our future.

**FORDOLA:** I need you to confirm the target, Commander.

**RAUBAHN:** Specula Imperatoris, main tower. Fire when ready.

**PIPIN:** What in the seven hells!?

**RAUBAHN:** Long-range artillery?

**PIPIN:** Those treacherous bastards... Their people were still fighting!
Full retreat, now! Relay the orders!

**LYSE:** Understood! All forces, retreat! I repeat: all forces, retreat!

**ALPHINAUD:** Conrad! Conrad! Speak to me!

**CONRAD:** It...it was all so sudden. Conrad had just convinced the last few Skulls to surrender, when...when we heard the bang, and...and everything started to shake... We carried the survivors to safety, but Conrad is... We have done what we can for him. All that remains is to pray.

**LYSE:** Ugh...

**CONRAD:** Conrad!?

**LYSE:** Is...is that you, Lyse? Can't...can't see a damn thing... Well, that's that, then. Time's up.

**CONRAD:** What are you talking about!? You'll be on your feet before you know it!

**LYSE:** It's all right, Lyse. I've lived long enough. But listen... I want...I want you to lead the Resistance in my stead.

**CONRAD:** Don't say another word! You'll recover─we'll recover! We'll bring freedom to Ala Mhigo together! We're not going to stop here!

**LYSE:** No...no, you won't. Everything we've built, everyone we've brought together...I know you'll show them the way... You've got it in you, Lyse. Not because you're Curtis's daughter, or Yda's sister, but because...because you're you. Because you're you...

**CONRAD:** Conrad...

**LYSE:** Lead them to victory. To freedom.

**SYSTEM:** I will, Conrad. I will. I promise.

**G3F1IMPERIALCENTURION:** Meanwhile, in the chaos of Castrum Abania...

**ESTINIEN:** Next round! Double the charge!

**GARLEANHARPOONER:** Come, Nidhogg. We are needed.

**G3F1IMPERIALCENTURION:** That's the ceruleum pipeline!

**ESTINIEN:** Impossible! How can one man─ Shoot the bastard! Shoot him!

**G3F1IMPERIALCENTURION:** Heh. My lance has slain far greater beasts. ...You're welcome, boy.

**ALISAIE:** Notify all units─I want that intruder found!
And get the engineers to fix my bloody cannon! The savages are coming!

**ALPHINAUD:** Are you all right!? Ah...I think that answers my question.
We have accomplished our objectives as well.

**LYSE:** Understood. We're on our way. Lyse's unit should be advancing upon the fire control center in the command tower. Let us join them. Lyse! Thank the Twelve you're all right.

**FORDOLA:** And you! There's the control center. Let's hit them hard and fast. Ready?

**LYSE:** They're here!

**FORDOLA:** It was you, wasn't it... Wasn't it!?

**LYSE:** Aye, I gave the order to fire.

**FORDOLA:** It was over! The Skulls had surrendered! No one else had to die!
And you killed them! Your own people! Your own comrades!

**LYSE:** You're right. I killed them. Ansfrid, Hrudolf, Emelin, all the rest─trained and fought with every last one of them. Good soldiers to a man. I gave the order that led to their deaths...and I knew exactly what I was doing.

**FORDOLA:** But why!? Why would you do that!?

**LYSE:** They died so that all Ala Mhigans could live free. That was all we ever wanted. We made a promise that we would do whatever it took so that one day...one day the imperials would learn to accept us. But everything comes at a price. And if you haven't got the means to pay, then you pay with blood. Service guarantees citizenship, but citizenship guarantees naught. It's not enough to do your part, oh no. You have to run faster, fight harder, kill more and more and more─and only then will you be equal. That's just how it is out here in the provinces. You buy your freedom with blood─there is no other way!

**ALISAIE:** Shut up! Shut your mouth! You don't get to talk about freedom!
You killed your own! They trusted you and you killed them!  Murderer! Butcher! Traitor!

**LYSE:** Lyse!

**ALISAIE:** Gotcha!

**FORDOLA:** Huh!?

**ALPHINAUD:** I know what you can do. I've already seen it.

**FORDOLA:** Alisaie!

**LYSE:** Even so, the odds are against me...

**FORDOLA:** Coward! Get back here!

**ALPHINAUD:** Hero! Lord Zenos invites you to join him for the royal hunt, to be hosted at the palace. You may bring your horde, if you like. All are welcome.

**LYSE:** She'll be all right, but we'll need to carry her. Will you help me? Thank you. Lyse, I leave matters here in your hands.

**RAUBAHN:** Uh, right...

**LYSE:** I wanted to show you this house. My house.

**RAUBAHN:** You mean...this is where you grew up?

**CURTIS:** Aye. Not much to look at, is it? Same could be said of the village. It was damn near impossible to live off
the land, barren as it was─which is why so many of us traded our plowshares for swords. Swords and uniforms, mind. We became military men. Tensions were rising between Ala Mhigo and the Empire, and there was always a need for more soldiers to watch the border. 'Twas only a matter of time before the first skirmishes broke out. It is a frightening thing to face magitek armor for the first time. But after a lot of trial and error, I found ways to bring them down. After a few victories, people even said I had a knack for it. And then one day they hit us. Hard. I was wounded and sent home to recover. Back here...

**RAUBAHN:** Will you remain silent for fear of the mad king's vengeance? Of his eyes and ears in the shadows and his knives in the dark? You who call this “living” dishonor our nation─it is but a slow death! Liberty or death. Liberty or death! If this be your creed, then raise up your hands! Raise up your voices! Together we will tear Theodoric from the throne! Together we will reclaim our freedom! Sent you home to mend, did they?

**CURTIS:** Aye, sir. Garleans got the better of us. The...the chirurgeons say I'm healing well, so it won't be long now.

**RAUBAHN:** Liberty or death, is it? Tell me, soldier: what do you think those words mean?

**CURTIS:** We...we must needs be willing to die for liberty?

**RAUBAHN:** Spoken like a true patriot. But liberty should not be the end in of itself. Liberty is the chance to build something better. A stronger, more prosperous home for our people. It's not quick or easy work, and it is never truly finished─but if you neglect it, then sooner or later, you look up to find you've traded one tyrant for another.

**CURTIS:** Well, sir, I...I've never asked for much. Never wanted to live like a king─just wish it were a little bit easier is all. For me and everyone else. And I'm...I'm willing to die for that, if that's what it takes!

**RAUBAHN:** Dying is easy, soldier. Living is harder. Rest. Mend. Regain your strength. You'll need it in the days to come...and mayhap one day we will need it too.

**LYSE:** Conrad chose you as his successor, Lyse, and I will not gainsay his decision.
I have but one question to ask.  Liberty or death. Those were Curtis's words, and his creed. Will you swear by your father's creed before your comrades and the gods?

**RAUBAHN:** Liberty or death... That's all you can hope for in war. Father understood that...and you want to know if I do too. I swear to you, here and now:
I will fight until the end, be it liberty or be it death. But the freedom we win must be for every Ala Mhigan─even ones like Fordola, though they may hate us, and the Ananta, though they may fear us. We'll fight and we'll talk and we'll find a way to make it work for all of us. Compared to all that, retaking our home will seem like the easy part.

**LYSE:** Hmm. A good oath. Then there is naught else to say.
You are indeed your father's daughter...

**000:** Sorry to have kept you waiting... Well, what do you think? I know it's a bit old-fashioned...but in a traditional sort of way. Yda wore it whenever she could... Not that I'm pretending to be her or anything! Not again. It's just...if this is the last battle we fight to free Ala Mhigo, then she ought to be a part of it.

**LYSE:** What will you say? It suits you. It's not quite your style... ...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**RAUBAHN:** I remember my father's words.
How they rang in my ears as we left Castrum Abania behind and looked out over the lochs before us. Comrades brave and true. They had come from all across Eorzea to stand with us.
To stand against oppression and tyranny. Twenty years the Empire had ruled us, but no longer.
Liberty or death. Liberty or death.

**PIPIN:** Ere we begin, I would say to you, as a proud son of Ala Mhigo, that I am grateful to each and every one of you for your part in this endeavor. Now, to the heart of the matter. The enemy appears content to remain within the city walls and await the inevitable siege. Open conflict has been sporadic thus far. Whether Zenos is biding his time until reinforcements arrive or attempting to bait us into a trap, none can say. We know better than to trust his word.

**LYSE:** Regardless, we can ill afford to present Garlemald with a chance to ready her legions. It would be in our best interests to press for a swift resolution.

**RAUBAHN:** A long siege wouldn't be good for the people in the city either.
If food becomes scarce, you know who'll starve first.

**LYSE:** Just so. Therefore, I propose we commit our forces to an all-out assault.
What say you? 'Twould seem we are of one mind. Then let us proceed to the how of it. The Immortal Flames will form the vanguard, supported by the archers and the conjurers of the Order of the Twin Adder, under the Elder Seedseer's command. Once the main host has cleared a path to the walls, we will bring forward the artillery of the Maelstrom and the Temple Knights. I would have your cannons pound the gates, and punch a hole right through the middle of their defenses!

**RAUBAHN:** What about the Resistance?

**LYSE:** Your part will be to occupy the residential district and keep civilians out of harm's way. The people are more like to trust their own.

**RAUBAHN:** Of course. You can count on us!

**ALPHINAUD:** Remember that there is a second entrance to the city proper there. If all goes to plan, we will have secured two points of entry. Once both objectives are complete, we press on into the city, surround the palace, and hunt down Zenos. As for the Scions, you will be held in reserve as an irregular unit until we have more intelligence on your captured comrade. Krile's rescue will be your primary concern, but I daresay we'll find a use for you once her freedom has been secured.

**RAUBAHN:** Thank you, General. I pray we find her quickly.

**FORDOLA:** Rhalgr's Beacon nears its end.
Soon, my friends, Ala Mhigo will be ours once more!

**LYSE:** [CRYING OUT IN PAIN]

**FORDOLA:** [ROAR OF RAGE]

**LYSE:** [HIT HARD AND SENT FLYING REAX GRUNT] No... Not after everything... I cannot lose... I will not!

**FORDOLA:** Oh, but you will. Without your tricks, you're nothing! Conrad, Meffrid, your own comrades!
I should kill you here and now for what you did! But there's no place for that kind of justice here. Not in my Ala Mhigo.

**LYSE:** Oh, how very bloody noble of you! Pffft. You'll pardon me my sins, will you? After you and your “freedom fighters” come and tear down everything we've worked so hard to build!? We were fighting for our people's freedom!

**ALPHINAUD:** You're slaves to a tyrant! There's no freedom in that!

**KRILE:** Now, my friend! Krile!

**THANCRED:** Alphinaud...? ...I knew you'd come.

**LYSE:** Touching as this moment is, it will have to wait. We should rejoin the main force at once. Lyse!

**FORDOLA:** I'm taking her back with us. Alive. She's going to answer for what she's done.

**LYSE:** Heh heh heh...listen to you, talking like you've already won. Zenos is going to tear you apart. He commands a power echoing that of the eikons.

**FORDOLA:** What are you talking about?

**LYSE:** The hunt, you stupid cow─I'm talking about the hunt! He said you'd come. And here you are, his willing prey. You and your friends are dead─just like mine. And all our misery, all our sacrifice...it was all for naught!

**FORDOLA:** ...No. You're gonna live long enough to see us win our freedom.
I promise you that.

**THANCRED:** May I live a thousand years...

**RAUBAHN:** Interrogations can wait. Let us be off!

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, the heroes of the hour! Not content with securing the residential district, you gifted me an imperial commander. What are you after, a medal?

**RAUBAHN:** The work is its own reward, General. I must say, however, that Fordola's claims were not a little disturbing. What manner of power could Zenos have acquired that might equal an eikon?

**ALPHINAUD:** Might she speak of our missing Omega?

**RAUBAHN:** Very possibly. The Empire's fondness for comparable Allagan technologies is exceedingly well documented. Have we made any progress with our own investigation?

**ALPHINAUD:** None. The search goes on in earnest, but Cid has thus far found nothing of note. Mayhap the Garleans beat us to it. If they were working desperately
to repair the machine, that might explain their decision to remain within
their walls...

**LYSE:** Ah, Lyse. I trust you surrendered Fordola into custody without incident.
We were just discussing the pilus's claims.

**KRILE:** About Zenos and his newfound powers? She hasn't said a word on the subject since we rescued Krile─even when the interrogator asked nicely.

**ALPHINAUD:** Mayhap I can offer some insight into her claims─or at least into the facility and the experiments they conducted during my time there. Though my memories of the period are somewhat muddled, there are a few things I remember with painful clarity.

**KRILE:** Thancred told us only that Fordola had undergone some...manner of treatment...

**LYSE:** Yes... It is a place wholly dedicated to the creation of enhanced beings whom they refer to as “the Resonant.” As I understand it, the process aims to
imbue a test subject with the qualities of an individual with demonstrated
magical aptitude.
This entails... This entails the m-mechanical extraction and transfusion of some manner of...primordial essence.

**URIANGER:** So that's how Fordola improved so fast. I knew there had to be something.
She wasn't half as strong or quick to predict my attacks when we first met. If it weren't for Urianger's siphon thingy, I really don't think we'd have
beaten her...

**LYSE:** My humble scheme asked far more in the execution than it required in the conception, I do assure thee.

**URIANGER:** Oh, you have got to stop doing that.

**ALPHINAUD:** In calling upon Lady Alisaie after her defeat, I was most intrigued to learn of the apparent effortlessness with which Fordola countered her attacks. 'Twas as if she knew the blade's destination ere its journey began. A most impressive feat under any circumstances, but an almost miraculous
one when considered in the context of Fordola's unfamiliarity with my
lady's arts. How then could she so perfectly predict an unknown opponent's
every move? After much deliberation, I surmised that Fordola may be possessed of a preternatural ability to divine meaning from the fluctuations of an individual's aether, and to instinctively react. To employ a metaphor, one might say that she was attuned to the whispers of my lady Alisaie's soul.

**URIANGER:** Wait! Have you not just described a manifestation of the Echo?

**ALPHINAUD:** I had no conclusive proof. The available anecdotal evidence suggested only that Fordola was uncommonly sensitive to aetheric fluctuations, and 'twas this which led me to develop my stratagem. I would fashion a device with the capacity to generate a massive disruption
in the surrounding aether. If, as I suspected, Fordola's senses were
indeed questing for the most minor of oscillations, the shock of exposure
to a more amplitudinous aetheric waveform would be akin to a debilitating
bout of aether sickness.

**URIANGER:** How...ingenious. I note that the success of your plan hinged on your device's wielder remaining ignorant of its purpose, lest Fordola divine your intent.

**KRILE:** Indeed so, Master Alphinaud.
All things considered, 'twas a most fortuitous outcome.

**RAUBAHN:** That's putting it mildly. In any event, if Urianger is correct, that would mean these Resonant have been granted the power of the Echo via artificial means. A sobering thought to say the least─and one which makes me wonder what else Zenos has in store.

**LYSE:** Whatever the viceroy's newfound powers, I know of none better equipped to face him. And face him you must. For there is now but one path forward, and it leads straight to Ala Mhigo.

**000:** And it's not as if we came unprepared. We've got all our friends and allies fighting for the same thing. Honestly, right now, I feel like we could take on anyone and win. And I mean anyone!

**LYSE:** What will you say? Victory is as good as ours! Nevertheless, let us proceed with all due caution. ...

**ALPHINAUD:** Exactly! Ohhh, I wouldn't want to be in Zenos's boots!
Not with the likes of us coming to get him!  Well, no one's saying we shouldn't be cautious!
...Though maybe I was getting a bit carried away. Enough talking! All right, all right! I get the message!
Action is what's needed now! Right─I'd best get back to the residential district. Thancred and the Resistance forces are waiting.

**KRILE:** It is time we joined the main host. Krile, in light of your recent ordeal...might I suggest that you remain with the rear guard for now?

**PIPIN:** Oh, if you insist...just this once.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, you are returned. Were your negotiations with the wolfmen successful?

**PIPIN:** The one they call the White was receptive to our words once we told him of Doma's liberation. They withdrew behind the walls to inform their brethren. If the gods are good, no blood shall be shed between our peoples this day.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hear, hear. Now...I think it's time we did something about those gates. Thaumaturges, forward! Give me hellfire! Give me Ifrit's bloody inferno! Now give me a Coerthan winter! Enough ice and snow to bury a behemoth! All cannons, fire at will! Let no man say we neglected to knock! Damn that armor! We nearly had it!

**HIEN:** Is that─?

**ALPHINAUD:** Bear witness, my Eorzean brothers and sisters!
Doma is come to pay her debts!

**HIEN:** Lord Hien!

**PIPIN:** We will deal with the flying machines!
Forward, my friends! For freedom and justice!

**ALPHINAUD:** You heard the man! All cannons, resume firing!

**ZENOS:** We're through! The way is clear!

**ALPHINAUD:** Heh heh heh heh... Ahahahahahaha! Yes, yes! Such ferocity, such tenacity! I am loath to recall how disappointed I was when first we fought...but finally, finally, after bathing in the blood and offal of your enemies, finally you prove yourself worthy prey for the hunt! It fills you even now, doesn't it? The hunger. To bite down on my jugular, to feel the warmth fill your mouth and run over even as you drink deep. Good, good! This is the beast I have longed to face! As you sharpened your claws, I too sought newfound strength! But this is no place for a final contest. Come! The heavens shall bear witness to our dance!

**ZENOS:** Confound it! Go after Zenos, my friend! We shall deal with this!

**000:** Welcome to the Royal Menagerie. The King of Ruin built this place for his foreign queen. He kept it filled with familiar creatures from her homeland. They bored me all. This fine specimen, on the other hand, is simply...divine. Your fates are entwined, are they not, eikon-slayer? This dragon, this...embodiment of unbridled despair, born of a desperate man's burning hatred for the Empire... How raw the raging tempest that churns within its breast. No myth made manifest this, but...a being of pure violence. Hah hah, mayhap you are the true architect of our design. You who fought the very soul of vengeance to the edge and watched him fall; you who let slip the Allagan hound to drive this eikon into my arms! Oh... My. Have I said too much? Forgive me, this...sensation is wholly unfamiliar to me. A question, then─and I should like very much for you to speak from the heart. If I were to stand aside, what would you do to this eikon?

**ZENOS:** What will you say? Kill it. Bind it. ...

**000:** Ah. As simple as that. But of course. You are the eikon-slayer. Such certainty is to be expected. But have I not already bound it with Omega's restraints? And does not the Seventh Umbral Calamity stand as a testament to the fallibility of such devices? Oh, how quickly we forget. Hm. You will not indulge me even with a simple reply, then? No. You think only of the fight to come. How alike we are. A pity. There is another alternative. Or there would be...had you only mastered your abilities. I speak of the Echo, of course. Does it merely render you immune to eikonic influence? Or is it rather that your influence is far greater than theirs? Granted, these implications are of no moment to a savage, who thinks only of killing the beast before him... But when I read van Baelsar's reports, I immediately saw the boundless potential of the Echo. I saw how it could be instrumental in binding an eikon to one's will. Hence my research and the Resonant─and oh so much more! All eikons must be exterminated, without exception. Such was the imperial mandate issued by my great-grandfather after he saw firsthand the destruction wrought by one such being. They are a blight upon this star, he felt, and so he began his great and just crusade. Pah! 'Twas not justice which spurred his campaign, but fear! Fear of the eikons, fear of their power. Cowardice made them march forth to battle. Pathetic! Man should fight for the joy of it. To live, to eat, to breed─lesser beasts snap and howl at one another for this. Only man has the wisdom and the clarity to embrace violence for its own sake. For we who are born into this merciless, meaningless world, have but one candle of life to burn. I know you understand this. You and I are one and the same.
Together, we could while away the quiet hours, as friend and confidant...if you will accept me.

**ZENOS:** What will you say? I accept you. I deny you.

**LYSE:** Heh heh...are we to embrace and let bygones be bygones? Do our deeds weigh so little that you would cast all aside? Come. 'Twas plain from the first how this would end. Heh heh...and yet, in doing so, you prove me right. We are warriors. 'Twas plain from the first how this would end. You live for these moments─when all hangs in the balance...when the difference between life and death is but a single stroke. I live for them too! This is who we are, my friend! This is all we are!
Ala Mhigo and Doma and Garlemald be damned! We tower above the gods! You by your gift, I by my might! And before the Resonant the gods shall be made to kneel! An ending to mark a new beginning!

**ZENOS:** Are you all right!? Zenos!

**LYSE:** [SUDDEN GASP OF PAIN] Hah...hah...hah... The hunter has indeed become the hunted. And yet...there is only joy. Transcendent joy that I have never known.
How invigorating, how...pure, this feeling.

**ZENOS:** Is that what this was all about? All the meaningless death and destruction?
So you could feel something!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Meaningless? Men die that others may live.
Those who survive are stronger for it. Not that you could ever understand. To have stood upon this great stage of fools...to have played my part to perfection... Oh, this...this moment...let it be enshrined in eternity. My heart...beating out of time... So clear, so vivid, so real... So real.

**LYSE:** Coward!

**ZENOS:** Stop!

**RAUBAHN:** Farewell, my first friend. My enemy.

**ALPHINAUD:** Where is he?

**RAUBAHN:** He's dead. By his own hand. He's dead. By his own hand.

**LYSE:** Then justice has been done.

**ALPHINAUD:** No...there's no justice in that...in that rabid animal's end.

**RAUBAHN:** Liberty or death. That so many should be forced to take up this creed to defeat such madness...

**HIEN:** We won. Forget him. The living have need of us now.

**LYSE:** Stand tall, Lyse! Now is the time to raise a cheer for all who fought for freedom! A cheer loud enough to carry to the highest heavens!

**SONGALAMHIGO:** ...You're right. Thank you. Without you... Well...you know. So let's do it together. For Ala Mhigo!

**LYSENARRATION:** O come ye wayward brothers,
Bereft of hearth and home, Beneath yon burning star there lies
A haven for the bold. Raise up your hands and voices,
Let fill your hearts with pride, Above the churning waters we
Stand strong and unified.

**LYSE:** In crimson it began, and in crimson it ended.
And then...and then we were free.

**ESTINIEN:** But what is freedom, really? We may be free to live, to love, to grow old. To have dreams and desires, and to strive for them. But in the end, we're defined by the legacy our forefathers bequeath to us. Even Zenos was once a baby in the cradle, innocent and pure.
He was made into a creature that lived only for death, not born one. Twenty years of imperial rule have left Ala Mhigo torn and bleeding. It won't be easy to heal a generation's worth of wounds, to bridge the gap.
But I won't give up, Papalymo. I won't. Because I remember the price of freedom. I remember the smoke and the ashes and the blood. I remember the screams...and the silence. And I'll do whatever it takes to honor their sacrifice. To build a home for us all. I promise you. This is the end. The end of the imperial province of Ala Mhigo, and the rebirth of Ala Mhigo the free nation. Long may she endure.

**LYSE:** Well, well, well, what a fine mess we've made. All but spent feeding that primal, eh? Well, you won't be making any mischief with that amount of aether. Still...better safe than sorry. There. There ends your hateful legacy.

**YSHTOLA:** We've been through a lot together, haven't we? I can't thank you enough. There's something I need to say to you all. That is, if you have a moment...? Good, you're all here. Good, good... "Thank you“ doesn't really suffice, does it? I'm grateful...truly grateful, from the bottom of my heart. But I know you didn't fight so hard just to hear me or anyone else say that. You fought because you wanted to help─because you believed it was right. Because you're Scions. Now, I'm obviously a Scion, but as Conrad left me in charge of things here,
I also have responsibilities to Ala Mhigo... When I put it like that, though...I realized I couldn't even pretend to be impartial anymore. So it seemed best to make it official. As long as I serve Ala Mhigo, I can't be a Scion. It might be selfish and shortsighted...but that's my decision.

**LYSE:** Am I to understand that you summoned us all─some of us still nursing wounds─to hear this?

**YSHTOLA:** Oh! I-I...I didn─ Um...

**LYSE:** Hahaha! Forgive me, Lyse! 'Twas but a jest. But this I say with the utmost sincerity: Scion or no, we are comrades.
Now and ever after. Is that not so? There you have it. Come what may, you may count on us in your hour of need. We shall never refuse you.

**GOSETSU:** Y'shtola... Oh gods, I swore I wouldn't cry...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MNAAGO:** Come to see how we're getting on? We've made good progress since we took back Ala Mhigo, but there's one big issue we still have to address... Leadership. The Domans had Lord Hien ready and willing to take the throne, but we've got no one like that here. Theodoric was our last ruler─and he wasn't called the mad king for nothing. [EXHAUSTED SIGH]

**LYSE:** Suffice it to say, our people have had their fill of kings─which means we need to find a new way forward.

**MNAAGO:** If only it were that easy. Everyone and his uncle has an opinion. For the time being, we're just going to have to keep leaning on General Aldynn and the Alliance for support, and see if we can't find a solution together. Something tells me we're going to be hosting a lot of meetings in the near future... But if that's what it takes, I'm ready to talk till my jaw aches! The Reach is yours, Naago. Don't do anything I wouldn't.

**ARENVALD:** Aye, aye, Commander!

**000:** Ah, there you are! I've been searching all over for you. Don't worry, it's nothing bad. That said, this might not be the best place to talk. Will you join me? I'll get to the point: might you be interested in a spot of adventure? After all, we were “adventurers” before we were Scions, were we not? After routing the imperials and liberating Ala Mhigo, I reckon we've earned a bit of respite, don't you? And what better way to spend it than by returning to our roots? So what say you: shall we call on Alphinaud and go adventuring?

**ARENVALD:** What will you say? Twist my arm, why don't you! It's what we do, I suppose...

**ARENVALD:** 'Twould appear this place is yet inhabited by King Theodoric's kin─or what is left of them. The work of terrible magicks, I fear...

**ALPHINAUD:** Terrible, aye, but their misfortune is our...fortune?

**ARENVALD:** Quite... By the Twelve, there is even more than I imagined...

**MNAAGO:** Oh, I can't wait to see the look on Lyse's face! Thanks for believing in me, you two!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN1:** Step back, all of you!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN2:** Like hells we will! We know who you've got in there!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN3:** We're not leaving till you hand her over!

**LYSE:** Bring her out! Bring her out!

**MNAAGO:** What's going on!?

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN1:** Someone let slip about Fordola...

**LYSE:** It's true then! The bitch really is in there! I knew it! I bloody knew it! We demand vengeance! Bring her out! Today we butcher the Butcher!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN2:** Butcher the...? Come on, you don't mean that. We'd be no better than the imperials! If you'd all just calm down─

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN3:** Calm down!? That monster and her thrice-damned Skulls dragged my man from our home and beat him to death in the street!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN1:** Aye! And my dad! That bitch has spilt enough blood to fill a loch!

**RAUBAHN:** We all know her crimes! She's a traitor and a murderer! How many of your Resistance friends have died at her hands, eh? And here you are protecting her!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN1:** So that's what all the fuss is about... Hearken to me, brothers and sisters of Ala Mhigo!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN2:** Eh? Who's this...?

**RAUBAHN:** That's...that's the Bull of Ala Mhigo!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZEN1:** My friends─you are not alone in your anger, your grief, your despair, for it is mine as well! That gnawing pain in your breast...it is enough to bring an old bull to his knees. But I ask you, brothers and sisters, to think not only of the family and friends who were cut down before your very eyes, but to think also of the ones who were abducted─the ones who may yet live! Where were they taken? What became of them? These questions demand answers! I share your thirst for justice. For vengeance. But we will gain only fleeting satisfaction if we give in to our base appetites─we will never know the truth! Now is the time that we, the people of Ala Mhigo, must decide what manner of nation we will build for ourselves, and for generations yet unborn. When they look to our example, will they see a people who held fast to their principles, or one who cast them aside when tried? I say to you, it is our responsibility to give these prisoners a fair trial, that they might answer to all of Ala Mhigo! The Garleans called us savages, and I'll be damned if we prove them right!

**FORDOLA:** I know you're right, I do, but...I can't...

**LYSE:** Well, well, well... So many visitors. Come to have a good laugh, have you? Or do you mean to put me out of my misery? To finish what you started? It's about bloody time.

**FORDOLA:** That's not why we're here, no. Do you remember what I said? How I promised you you'd live long enough to see us win our freedom? Well, I meant it. And not to mock you, either.

**ARENVALD:** You're wasting your time. All of this is pointless. There's no reason to keep me alive, and you know it! I killed your men─I killed my men! And you know what my only regret is? That I didn't kill you when I had the chance!

**FORDOLAMOTHER:** That's a lie, and you know it! You think we can't tell what you're trying to do? That we're blind? You're a fool, but you're not stupid. You're ruthless. Relentless. You'd give up anything and everything to get what you want. You didn't come this far, climbing over the bodies of your own brothers and sisters, just to piss it all away! I see you, Fordola! I see you for what you are!

**FORDOLA:** Come along, Fordola! We mustn't be late! The imperial viceroy will be attending today's banquet!

**FORDOLAFATHER:** All right... Father, what's Lord Gaius like? Is he nice? Are you friends?

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** There you go again with all your questions... Lord Gaius is a great and honorable man who looks after all of Ala Mhigo. He's very busy, and if we don't hurry, we'll miss our chance to see him.

**FORDOLA:** Filthy tinhead-lovers...

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** Father, what did that man call us?

**FORDOLA:** The little tinhead-lover doesn't know what she is, eh? A traitor, sweetheart. A backstabbing bitch who'd gladly betray her kith and kin to gnaw on what few scraps the imperials deign to toss her. Like your bastard father and whore mother!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** That's not true! My parents are good people! They've never done anything like that!

**FORDOLAFATHER:** Oh but they were quick to help themselves and their bitch spawn, weren't they? You're just as guilty as them!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** Fordola!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENB:** Traitors!

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENC:** Traitors!

**FORDOLAMOTHER:** Traitors!

**ALAMHIGOGARLEANOFFICER:** Please! You have to do something! My husband and daughter are in danger!

**FORDOLAMOTHER:** Soldiers of the imperial army are under no obligation to intervene in the disputes of Aan.

**FORDOLAFATHER:** We're citizens! We have rights!

**FORDOLA:** [GASP OF PAIN]

**FORDOLAFATHER:** Father, I'm scared!

**FORDOLA:** It's all right, it's all right. They don't understand. But they'll see in time. They'll see that this is the only way to survive.

**ALAMHIGOGARLEANOFFICER:** [SHRILL SCREAM OF TERROR]

**FORDOLAMOTHER:** Let the savages have their fun. They'll be more compliant once they've tired themselves out.

**FORDOLA:** Fordola, please! You already have citizenship! Why would you want to become a soldier!? Oh gods, what have you done to your face!?

**FORDOLAMOTHER:** Forgotten it already, have you? I'm honoring Father's memory.

**FORDOLA:** By telling the world that you're no better than a common savage!?

**ARENVALD:** Am I, though, Mother? Are any of us? Can't you see? Citizenship means nothing to them. If you're not a pureblood Garlean, you're no different from any other savage. So I'll play the part. I'll join the legion and I'll make them respect me. And when the mob see that, they'll think twice before throwing their stones. Ansfrid, Hrudolf, Emelin. It's time! It'll be hard. Humiliating. They'll try to break us─send us crawling back to our “own kind.” But we won't, no matter what. We'll bleed for them─die for them if we have to. We'll do whatever it takes to be free!

**FORDOLA:** So, you mean to play the part one last time, eh? The unrepentant traitor, whose death will serve to unite the people?

**ARENVALD:** Shut up!

**FORDOLA:** You had every chance to kill yourself. Fashion a noose from your clothes, wait for the guards to leave you alone long enough to slip it over your neck─

**ARENVALD:** I said shut up!

**FORDOLA:** But then it would all have been for nothing, wouldn't it? Whatever it takes. That's what you said.

**000:** ...Been in my head, have you? Had a little peek at my past? And what, a few stolen memories tell you everything you need to know, do they? Don't you dare patronize me! You don't know a godsdamned thing about the life I've led! The bastards that killed him, the bastards that let it happen─my father deserved better! I swore I'd do whatever it took to make them pay! Ugh... [EXHAUSTED PANTING] You...y-you... All that power...all that pain... It's too much... Too much for anyone! The things they've done to you. The lies, the betrayal, the endless fighting...yet there you stand, unbroken. How...? Why...?

**FORDOLA:** What will you say? You know why. You saw. For those I have lost. For those I can yet save. Because I choose to.

**LYSE:** Damn you... Damn you all...

**NANAMOULNAMO:** You still have time, Fordola. Think about how you want to spend it. Let's go.

**HIGHLANDERGLADIATOR:** I thank you for answering my summons in these most interesting times. You have been busy. The liberation of Ala Mhigo will have far-reaching consequences, and there is a matter upon which I would seek your counsel. I speak of Raubahn, and his future. All know the tale of his rise from penniless refugee to member of the Syndicate, and General of the Immortal Flames... Yet though he has come to call Ul'dah home, it will never be his homeland. He is a son of Ala Mhigo. And now that she is free, I thought it only a matter of time before he sought my leave to return to her. Indeed, I had resigned myself to his loss. Suffice it to say, I was...greatly surprised to hear him speak so lightly of handing over the reins in Ala Mhigo, and retaking his place at my side. I will welcome him with open arms, of course─he is my most trusted advisor...and my dearest friend. But I have known the man a long time, and beneath that steely gaze, I spied a flicker of doubt. Whether Raubahn chooses to remain in Ul'dah or return to Ala Mhigo, I only wish that he do so with a heart unburdened by guilt or regret. Yet how can he freely make such a choice knowing how much I depend on him? It is past time that I learned to discharge my duties as a sultana alone. I must go forth and see my realm with my own eyes, and hear the wind with my own ears. Might I have your company for a brief adventure? Wonderful. Allow me a moment to change into something a touch less conspicuous, and I will join you outside.

**RAUBAHN:** [CHARGING BATTLE  CRY]

**ROEGADYNGLADIATOR:** [SWINGING SWORD GRUNT]

**RAUBAHN:** [STAGGERING BACKWARDS EXERTION] [LOUD LOW FRUSTRATED GROWL] [ROAR OF RAGE]

**ROEGADYNGLADIATOR:** [SWINGING SWORD GRUNT]

**RAUBAHN:** [HITTING GROUND HARD REAX GRUNT]

**NANAMOSTEWARD:** [EXHAUSTED PANTING] [RELIEVED SIGH]

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace, you mustn't! The danger is too great! Please, Your Grace, come back! I beg of you!

**RAUBAHN:** It seems you're the one who needs looking after, Marcechamp! Raubahn!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace! I have kept the promise made.

**RAUBAHN:** So you have. And, in turn, so too shall I keep mine. With your winnings, you have become one of the six most wealthy souls in all Ul'dah. And so, as tradition dictates, Raubahn Aldynn... ...You have earned yourself a seat on the Syndicate! May your new station garner you still greater glories!

**LOLORITO:** I am honored, Your Grace, and vow to serve with every fiber of my being, from this day till my last. Long live the sultana! And long live Ul'dah!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** A personal summons from the Scions─this must be important business indeed. Though if it concerns anything so underhand as an assassination, I fear I can be of little help. Hm hm hm hm. You have made your point. 'Tis indeed unsettling to find oneself seated across from an impassive mask. There. Would this better please Your Grace? Or should I address you as “Lady Lilira,” hmm?

**LOLORITO:** Nay, the deception has served its purpose. I am glad to see you found amusement in my little jest, Lord Lolorito, but shall we proceed to the business at hand?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** By all means. I must say, I am most eager to hear your proposal.

**LOLORITO:** Simply put, I would aid the refugees camped in Thanalan in their efforts to return to Ala Mhigo. The reparations you paid in the wake of your earlier misdemeanors will be used to fund the endeavor─together with the fortune seized from the late Teledji Adeledji's estate. But this plan is not intended to benefit the displaced alone. I would make of this an investment which shall enrich Ul'dah and Ala Mhigo both. And who better to consult on matters of profit than the wealthiest man in all of Thanalan? I beseech you, then, Lord Lolorito...share with us your mercantile wisdom.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Ah heh heh... 'Twould seem Your Grace has matured beyond acts of earnest yet misplaced charity. Pray tell me more... To summarize: in return for facilitating the repatriation of refugees, and assisting in the establishment of new industry in Ala Mhigo, you ask that a proportion of all subsequent profits be promised to Ul'dah. I am impressed, Your Grace. 'Tis an elegant solution─albeit one lacking certain crucial details, specifically which industry and where.

**000:** How swiftly you identify the weakness in my plan, just as I knew you would. Your travels have taken you across the length and breadth of Gyr Abania, and you know the land far better than I. Which of the settlements you visited would best provide a home for our refugees? Which has the greatest potential to flourish, given the appropriate investment?

**LOLORITO:** What will you say? Ala Gannha. Ala Ghiri. The Saltery. What will you say? Ala Ghiri. The Saltery. What will you say? Ala Gannha. The Saltery. What will you say? The Saltery. Clearly you want me to say “the Saltery.”

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Yes, a quarry town certainly does carry the potential for profit─at least, it would do, were it situated anywhere near a lucrative market. It would cost more to transport the materials than they are worth. In my humble opinion. Yes, if a stable trade route can be established between Ul'dah and Ala Mhigo, then Ala Ghiri would once more become an important waypoint. But while such growth would greatly benefit its current residents, I am afraid it could sustain little beyond that... Ah, yes─that desolate little village on the shore of Loch Seld. I know the Saltery and its products well. The imperial invasion brought an end to their more widespread distribution, much to the dismay of many a wealthy gourmand. Myself included. Salt has ever been a transformative ingredient. And in this instance, I daresay it could transform a modicum of effort into a mountain of gil.

**LOLORITO:** The local citizens will need to be consulted, of course, but I trust the East Aldenard Trading Company can be relied upon to provide its assistance in negotiating a mutually beneficial arrangement.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Naturally, Your Grace. I shall dispatch representatives well versed in the extraction of this “white gold,” and wring every last onze of profit from its production. The loch's bounty will contribute to Ala Mhigo's enrichment, whilst easing the burden on the Bull's aching shoulders─just as Your Grace desired.

**RAUBAHN:** A deal is struck, then!

**PIPIN:** Apologies for the wait. People are screaming for the Butcher's blood again. No sooner have we broken up one mob than another forms. Thankfully, all have been amenable to reason...thus far. But it is no concern of yours. We must speak of the men Arenvald and his comrades apprehended in the Peaks.

**RAUBAHN:** By their uniforms, the captives were first judged to be imperial troops...but after further investigation, their true identities came to light. I daresay you remember Yuyuhase and Laurentius─the fugitives who conspired with Captain Ilberd in the Crystal Braves' betrayal. Aye, well...it would seem they followed him all the way to the Wall. It was they who orchestrated the slaughter of the Resistance fighters prior to the Griffin's infernal ritual.

**000:** Were it in your hands, how would you punish these men?

**RAUBAHN:** What will you say? Their lives would be forfeit. Execution is not the answer.

**PIPIN:** Hear, hear. There is no more fitting sentence for the perpetrators of such a massacre. And that is but one of their crimes. You would spare these animals? Yours is a more merciful brand of justice than mine. In any event, I thank you for your honesty. When the time comes for the Alliance to pass judgment, I'll see that your opinion is heard. Well, that concludes our business here, but there is more I would say. Walk with me. I bear a share of the blame for Ilberd's atrocities. Had I openly supported the cause of Ala Mhigan liberation, he might not have felt driven to do what he did... Things could have been different, and I'm sorry they aren't. But even after all that has happened, my homeland is free. With the Scions and the Alliance at their side, my countrymen have reclaimed what many thought lost forever. Under her new leadership, I have every confidence that Ala Mhigo will emerge from the shadow of the Empire and rise once more to greatness. Which means my work here is done. Soon, I will return to Ul'dah, and take my place at the sultana's side.

**RAUBAHN:** Father...

**PIPIN:** I'll not deny there's a part of me that wants to stay... The same part that contemplated renouncing my rank and joining you as a wandering sellsword. But I pledged my blade to Nanamo. And I will not betray that oath.

**RAUBAHN:** Is this truly what you want, Father?

**LYSE:** It is. Ever has my sword been hers to command, and ever shall it remain. Thank you for lending an ear. When all the rest are clamoring for me to stay, I trust you'll send me on my way.

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you all for coming. I am Lyse Hext, and I speak for the Resistance. Among you are village elders, refugee leaders; envoys from the Ananta and the Qiqirn. You've come from every corner of Gyr Abania to help decide the future of Ala Mhigo. But before that, I want to ask you a question. What was the first thing you noticed when you came in? For me, it was that empty throne. It has no one to sit on it now. No viceroy. No king. Would any of you like to take their place? Or should someone else sit there? Then let's sit here, in a circle. As equals. And, I hope, as friends.

**RAGANFRID:** Expertly done. Lyse has removed monarchy as a choice early in the game, and positioned them to consider a joint government. All things considered, I would say events have got off to a fine start...

**LYSE:** ...and that is Ala Gannha's stance on the matter.

**QALYANAPATRIARCH:** Thank you, Raganfrid. Another vote in favor. Next, let's hear from Shanti of the Qalyana. Tell us, how do your people feel about the idea of a republic...?

**LYSE:** The Ananta wish only that those who dwell within Gyr Abania devote themssselves to our faith... You shall all worship Sri Lakshmi! Lady of Bliss! Grace usss once more with your beauteousss visage!

**ALPHINAUD:** This can't be happening... No crystals were allowed through the door!

**ARENVALD:** We can worry about the how of it later! We need to evacuate these people right now, or the primal will make thralls of them all!

**RAUBAHN:** It's up to us!

**LYSE:** Hrrraaaaaagh! Godsdammit! The guards were already turned! Fools!

**RAUBAHN:** No you don't!

**LYSE:** The Qalyana would see us all enthralled.

**RAUBAHN:** Then they're going to be sorely disappointed. We have the Warrior of Light and Arenvald to shield us.

**LYSE:** Aye, but they can't well defend your guests and attack the primal, can they? We're stuck on the back foot.

**RAUBAHN:** Uh... All right. I think I have an idea. Keep these people safe, General! I'll be back as soon as I can!

**ARENVALD:** Bah! Whatever she's about, she'd best make it quick! Come, then! Who will be next to die on my steel!?

**FORDOLA:** Damn it all... It's only a matter of time before we miss one... Her!?

**ARENVALD:** What of it? Do you want to kill this thing or not?

**FORDOLA:** [PANTING WITH EXHAUSTION] We...we did it! We beat her!

**LYSE:** ...What is this?

**RAGANFRID:** ...I'm only going to say this once. The Ananta just summoned their primal in the throne room. My friends are fighting her, but they need help. They need someone with the Echo, and by the gods, I wish I had it. But I don't. I told you before that you still had time, but things have changed. I need your answer now. You can end it like Zenos...or you can fight for Ala Mhigo. Your choice.

**FORDOLA:** Seven hells... It's her...the Butcher!

**RAGANFRID:** It's done. Take me back to my cell.

**RAUBAHN:** You are not forgiven. Not you. You I will never forgive. But I will thank you. For standing against a primal and saving us from servitude─you have my thanks.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** A fine spot to contemplate the heavens... The meeting is over. The envoys have chosen to instate a government modeled on Ishgard's House of Commons─a ruling body of representatives elected by the people. 'Tis a fair decision, and one which signals the end of my part in all this. But I would gaze upon Gyr Abania's stars one last time before I leave... Forget something? Your Grace!? I─ There was no word...

**RAUBAHN:** Raubahn Aldynn. You are hereby dismissed as General of the Immortal Flames, and relieved of your seat on the Syndicate.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** But, Your Grace...

**RAUBAHN:** Raubahn, I am no longer a child. Stay here, in your homeland. Work with your brethren. Rebuild Ala Mhigo!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** You desire to stand alone─I understand. But remember what happened...

**RAUBAHN:** I remember full well the consequences of my naivety! And thus did I consult at length with a most trusted advisor ere I embarked upon this course!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** A most trusted advisor!? And what of me? Am I no longer deserving of your confidence?

**RAUBAHN:** What trust can there be between us when you withhold the truth from me!? Did you think me oblivious to the anguish in your eyes when you spoke of returning to Ul'dah!? For years and years, we have trusted one another, yet now you refuse to confess your heart's desire!?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I swore an oath to you that day on the sands. I pledged my sword─

**RAUBAHN:** And it has served me well. But in Pipin you have forged a new sword, as sharp and deadly as the blade you bequeathed him. I will show you a sultana who can wield every weapon at her disposal─including Lolorito and his Monetarist cronies! So follow your heart...please. You are home. You are free.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Nanamo, I...

**RAUBAHN:** Smile for me, Raubahn. I would have this parting be a joyous one.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Thank you, Your Grace. It has been an honor to serve you and Ul'dah.

**RAUBAHN:** Tomorrow you will serve Ala Mhigo, and fight for the good of all Eorzea. Am I understood?

**LYSE:** Yes, Your Grace...

**ARENVALD:** Thanks for shielding us from Lakshmi, you two. If you hadn't been there, the rest of us would be worshipping her by now.

**ALPHINAUD:** You're kind to include me, Lyse, but we both know who did most of the work. I could scarce keep track of the battle, let alone land a telling blow. No shame in admitting it. The Warrior of Light has put far better men than me in the shade.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Ahem. Did I mention that I encountered the sultana in the palace? It would seem Her Grace has come to Gyr Abania to oversee the final stages of her relocation project. She was in search of General Aldynn, and I directed her to the rooftop garden. I do hope he was still there...

**ALPHINAUD:** Are you in the habit of gossiping about the affairs of royalty, Master Leveilleur?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Certainly not, Your Grace! I was merely informing my companions─

**RAUBAHN:** Be at ease, Alphinaud. 'Twas only a jest. But I must yield the floor to Raubahn. He has an important announcement to make.

**PIPIN:** [THROAT-CLEARING “ahem”] As of yesternight, I have been relieved of my post in the Immortal Flames and the Syndicate both...

**RAUBAHN:** ...I shall be assuming my father's duties. And may I say that Tizona has never felt heavier upon my back.

**PIPIN:** 'Twould seem I am in need of employment. Mayhap one of my old acquaintances can introduce me to a mercenary company or some such...

**NANAMOULNAMO:** You may be getting on in years, Father, but you'd struggle to find a band of sellswords who wouldn't snap your hand off─your...remaining hand.

**RAUBAHN:** [STIFLED GIGGLING] Yes, the Bull of Ala Mhigo need not be put out to pasture just yet... [UNABLE TO CONTAIN HERSELF, BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER]

**LYSE:** Your Grace has developed a wicked edge to her humor. And you, Pipin, would do well not to laugh when the future may hold the same for you!

**RAUBAHN:** So...does this mean you're staying?

**LYSE:** Aye. That seems to be the way of it. I would be glad to aid you in rebuilding our nation. If you'll have me.

**ALPHINAUD:** "If,“ he says! Welcome home, Raubahn.



---------------------------------------------------------------------




---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALISAIE:** My friends! Thank you for coming at such short notice!

**SOROBAN:** We were told the matter was urgent. I take it Yugiri and Soroban are also involved?

**YUGIRI:** Ah, my presence here is but a happy coincidence. I am come on separate business─which can wait.

**HANCOCK:** My apologies. Master Hancock─pray tell our friends exactly what you told me.

**ALPHINAUD:** Of course, of course. Some few days ago, a large detachment of soldiers was seen arriving at the Garlean embassy. This seemed to me most unusual, as no personages of note are due to visit for a matter of months. So I made a few inquiries, whereupon I learned of a most curious rumor. Apparently, the soldiers were dispatched to Kugane to investigate recent sightings of a certain individual. The late acting imperial viceroy of Doma─Yotsuyu!

**YUGIRI:** I beg your pardon!?

**HANCOCK:** I, too, am loath to believe it. I saw the keep come down on top of her. We all did.

**ALISAIE:** I would not presume to question your eyewitness accounts, nor am I one to take rumors at face value. The fact is, the Garleans have no knowledge of what took place at Doma Castle─they may well be chasing after a woman who merely resembles Yotsuyu. But a woman who resembles Yotsuyu in the company of a grizzled Roegadyn samurai? I daresay that thickens the plot.

**HANCOCK:** ...Gosetsu? He's alive!?

**ALISAIE:** While I've no conclusive proof, I thought that such a possibility warranted your attention.

**YUGIRI:** Have you informed Lord Hien? Well, I think we'd all like to believe the old bear survived.

**000:** Indeed. While I dare not give myself wholly to hope, I will not deny that I have prayed for such a miracle ever since that fateful day. But regardless of my personal feelings, if the Empire has seen fit to pursue these rumors so vigorously, we can scarce afford to ignore them. I am bound by duty to ascertain the truth of the matter. Will you join me in this quest?

**YUGIRI:** What will you say? Aye. We'll find Gosetsu together. I...am not sure what I'd do if I saw Yotsuyu again.

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you. If Gosetsu yet lives, he will need our help if he is to avoid capture. I understand. Only too well. But if Gosetsu yet lives, he will need our help if he is to avoid capture.

**HANCOCK:** Gosetsu is a dear friend, and we cannot abandon him to the mercy of the Empire. Our course is clear. Hancock, is there aught else you can tell us?

**ALPHINAUD:** Alas not─but I have taken the liberty of employing one of the finest informants money can buy. You shall have the latest intelligence on the Garleans' movements and more besides.

**IKARUGA:** Right. I suggest we begin by learning what we can from the sentries. What's going on out there!?

**YUGIRI:** Travelers, are you? You may wish to postpone your plans. The Garleans have launched an attack on the Confederacy. We have no reason to believe they'll turn their attention here, but for your own safety I suggest you return to Kugane.

**ALPHINAUD:** The Garleans bear no love for the Confederacy, but with Doma lost to them, why would they attack? Unless...

**ALISAIE:** Unless Yotsuyu is on that island.

**ALPHINAUD:** Even if she isn't, our allies are under attack, and they need our help.

**ALISAIE:** *We* will help them, while *you* remain with Soroban. Arguing will only delay us. Is that clear?

**ALPHINAUD:** Fine. But you haven't heard the last of this.

**SOROBAN:** Soroban─we may need to make a swift exit. See that the boat is ready to sail at a moment's notice.

**ALISAIE:** It shall be done!

**ALPHINAUD:** What, and you're going to *swim* there, are you?

**YUGIRI:** 'Tis the quickest way. And you may rest assured I've been practicing!

**IMPERIALCENTURION:** Come!

**GOSETSU:** Lady Yotsuyu, we're here to rescue you! Please come with us!

**YOTSUYU:** Stay back, Tsuyu.

**IMPERIALCENTURION:** Are you all right!?

**YUGIRI:** Is *he* all right?

**IMPERIALCENTURION:** Gosetsu!

**YUGIRI:** Damn it! We took too long. Change of plan─eliminate hostiles! All forces─attack!

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu! Thank the heavens!

**TANSUI:** Yugiri, my friends... The kami were kind to guide your steps this way.

**GOSETSU:** It's over. The imperials are retreating. I suppose we have you to thank for that. But they would never have come here were it not for *her*. I had a bad feeling the moment your samurai friend arrived with that woman in tow.

**YOTSUYU:** Do not be afraid, Tsuyu. These people are my friends.

**ALPHINAUD:** Friends?

**GOSETSU:** Forgive me, but at the risk of souring the mood, I believe you owe us an explanation. You may start by telling us what happened at Doma Castle.

**ALPHINAUD:** Of course. I'll not begrudge you that. As you know, we were trapped inside the keep when it collapsed. But even as the roof crumbled above us, so too did the floor below. We were swept out into the One River, where we would surely have drowned had a stout wooden door not chanced to float by, offering us a raft of sorts. Exhausted, we drifted out to sea, at the mercy of the tides...which saw fit to dispense us on a desert island.

**GOSETSU:** She was with you the entire time?

**YUGIRI:** Aye. 'Twas her kimono which saved her from Hien's blade, believe it or not. Some Garlean witchcraft in the weave. But it offered precious little protection against the fall. Though she survived, she awoke bereft of all her memories, and speaking like a child.

**GOSETSU:** A trick, surely?

**YUGIRI:** That was my first thought, aye. And I contemplated cutting her down and being done with it. Contemplated it long and hard... Yet the kami saw fit to deliver us from certain death. 'Twas their will that we survive. Both of us. Together. And together we shall go before our master. He shall be the one to judge.

**TANSUI:** Judge *what*...?

**GOSETSU:** She's your prisoner, old man. Do with her as you will. Call her “Tsuyu” or whatever else tickles your fancy.

**TANSUI:** 'Twas a name given out of necessity whilst on the road. Nothing more.

**GOSETSU:** As you say. But remember this: our people suffered much at that woman's hands. When the time comes, I trust you won't let emotion blind you to what needs to be done.

**TANSUI:** You have my word.

**GOSETSU:** Well, I must be going─I've an unholy mess to clean up. You should be on your way too, before the imperials decide to take another tilt. Oh...and we'll overlook the tithe this once. You're welcome.

**HIEN:** My lord Hien. I am returned.

**GOSETSU:** Save your tears for the morrow. For we who yet walk the path should not think too much on the destination. When the hour arrives, we shall welcome what comes with open arms. And welcome it you did, even as the keep fell down around us. At that moment, in your smile, I spied a shred of hope. One which I have clung to ever since. Gosetsu. Full glad am I to see you alive and well.

**HIEN:** We have played this scene before, have we not? Though this time our roles are reversed.

**YUGIRI:** That they are. Meaning you know how I feel. Wholly at a loss for words. Welcome back, old friend! Now then, though we rejoice at your return, it seems you have brought with you certain...complications. Rise, my friend. Tell me everything. The Empire is bold indeed to send a token force to engage the Confederacy.

**HIEN:** As acting viceroy, Yotsuyu would have been privy to imperial secrets. The Garleans will not soon give up the chase.

**YOTSUYU:** Nay. It will end with her capture...or her death.

**GOSETSU:** Are you a friend too?

**HIEN:** She claims to have lost her memory, though I know not if she speaks true. I brought her here that you might decide her fate.

**YUGIRI:** Lost her memory, you say... Regardless, the people have not forgotten. Her face yet haunts their dreams. She cannot roam free. We will hold her here for a time. Place her in Jifuya's care, with the express instruction that she is not to be seen.

**YOTSUYU:** Yes, my lord. Come.

**GOSETSU:** N-No, I don't want to. Don't let her take me away!

**HIEN:** It's all right, Tsuyu. I will come with you. Be a good girl and listen to Yugiri.

**JIFUYA:** From a hound at his throat to a puppy at his heel... If this is an act, it is a remarkable performance.

**YUGIRI:** By the kami! You're Lord Hien's─ L-Leave me! Leave me, I beg of you! Say nothing of this! I was never here!

**JIFUYA:** There you are.

**GOSETSU:** Lady Yugiri. Lord Gosetsu. Forgive me my abrupt disappearance.

**JIFUYA:** You have your reasons, I am sure. Will you not share them?

**GOSETSU:** I was...I was her master. When she was yet a courtesan.

**JIFUYA:** By the kami...

**GOSETSU:** She...worked in my establishment. Her father was a regular client of mine. One day, quite without preamble, he offered to sell her to me. “She may be no maiden,” he said, “but she has some use left in her.” He sold her short. When I first beheld her, I was struck by her beauty. And yet, behind her eyes, there was...an emptiness. 'Twas as if she had given up on life. She seemed more a doll than a woman. It was no profession for her, but I knew she would be popular. And so it proved. Men flocked to drown themselves in that cold, bottomless gaze. The rest you know. She became an imperial informant, and for her loyal service won the office of acting viceroy.

**JIFUYA:** ...While you came to serve the Liberation Front.

**GOSETSU:** 'Tis said that the atrocities Yotsuyu committed were driven by vengeance. If so, I bear part of the blame for creating the monster she became. Joining the Front was meant to be my atonement. But the truth is... The truth is, I am a coward whose only thought was to escape her wrath. Then as now.

**YUGIRI:** ...I see. Then I shall recommend that you be assigned to a new post. I trust you have no objections, Yugiri?

**JIFUYA:** None. It would not do to leave Yotsuyu in his care.

**YUGIRI:** I am in your debt.

**HIEN:** Who is it that you seek to protect, Gosetsu? Idle musings. Pray pay me no mind.

**YUGIRI:** A smoke signal...? Thoughts, Yugiri?

**HIEN:** In former times, such signals were used to announce the coming of an emissary of peace─in Doma, at least. But could that truly be their intent?

**YUGIRI:** Who can say? Whatever they want, we cannot simply blast them out of the sky─not when they were so gracious as to honor one of our *cherished* traditions. I would not have it said that we Domans want for propriety.

**HIEN:** Then I shall go and reconnoiter.

**YUGIRI:** Nay, that won't be necessary. We will meet them openly. I would welcome this student of Doman history in person, whomsoever he or she may be...

**ASAHI:** As you wish, my lord. I shall arrange for a signal of our own to be fired in answer.

**HIEN:** Well! That we should be received by the lord of Doma himself!

**ASAHI:** I but afford an emissary of peace the courtesy he is due. Welcome to Doma, my lord...?

**YUGIRI:** Ah, where are my manners? I am Asahi sas Brutus, ambassador plenipotentiary of Garlemald.

**ASAHI:** He is heir to the Naeuri clan...and Yotsuyu's stepbrother.

**HIEN:** It seems I need not introduce myself─not in the presence of the famed Yugiri Mistwalker. Your skills as a shinobi are known far and wide, my lady. It is true─the former acting viceroy is my sister. Yet, bonds of kinship aside, we have precious little in common. As will soon become plain, I come not to sow strife, but to end it. I am of the Populares, a collective which represents the interests of the common man. Long have we labored to bring about reform to the Empire's provincial policy. Happily for us, our master acknowledges the need for change. Indeed, His Radiance, Emperor Varis zos Galvus personally sanctioned this mission, granting me the authority to speak with his voice. To negotiate peace with Doma.

**ASAHI:** Well then, we have much to discuss. Will you accompany me to my hall?

**HIEN:** Gladly, my lord! On behalf of my delegation, I offer you my humblest thanks. Never did I imagine that I would meet the gallant and noble lord of Doma himself, nor be welcomed into his magnificent hall.

**ASAHI:** You'll forgive me if we forgo the pleasantries. You say you are come to negotiate peace. Unless I am mistaken, such negotiations are typically conducted between *sovereign* nations. I was not aware that the Emperor had recognized Doma's sovereignty.

**HIEN:** His Radiance has yet to do so, that much is true. Know, however, that he has expressed willingness to cede Doma to her ancestral masters and treat with her as a friend. Since the days of Emperor Solus, the Empire has aggressively expanded its territory. While you may not agree with our founding father's policy of expansion, I believe there is room for discussion on the matter of his lifelong goal─to rid the world of eikons. Eikons are a blight upon this star. They cannot be suffered to exist. This you know as well as we. In his wisdom, Emperor Varis wishes to explore the possibility of an alliance to combat this common threat. On the condition that Doma renounces summoning and pledges to police the Kojin's practice of it, His Radiance would extend the hand of friendship.

**ASAHI:** Doma has never shown any appetite for summoning. And it should go without saying that we will address any threat to our people, eikon or otherwise. With regard to the Kojin, I must stress that they only resorted to summoning under extreme provocation. When the Ruby Sea was at peace, and their sacred relics safe, they looked not to their kami for protection. Yet even now there are certain parties who would destabilize the region with ill-conceived military forays. Unless they alter their course, we cannot hope to be rid of eikons.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...Quite. I can but apologize. In seeking to eliminate eikons, the Empire creates them. 'Tis an irony among ironies. One with which the people of Eorzea are well acquainted, I am told.

**ASAHI:** Indeed, many summonings are the result of persecution, the weak being driven to call upon the divine for deliverance from the strong. So it was in Ala Mhigo─the bitter fruit of Garlean oppression.

**HIEN:** A tragic state of affairs. If we are to put an end to summoning once and for all, it shall not be through might, but harmony. Yet we continue to repeat our mistakes, oblivious to the lessons of history. My comrades and I would change all that. We Populares have campaigned long and hard for a shift in imperial policy, and at last the Emperor has seen fit to lend us an ear. Alas, there is a faction within Garlemald that would obstruct our every attempt at reform. A collection of pure-blooded Garleans who seek to consolidate their own supremacy: the Optimates. Lest you wonder, theirs was the hand that loosed our forces on the Confederacy. 'Twas a regrettable incident, one that flies in the face of everything we believe, and I swear to do all in my power to prevent a reoccurrence.

**ASAHI:** That would be most welcome. But if I may speak plain─if the Empire itself is not of one mind, how can we be certain that any peace we negotiate will be honored?

**HIEN:** I cannot blame you for doubting us. Indeed, I should find it strange if you did not. And so, in the name of building trust, I would like to make a proposal: a prisoner exchange.

**ASAHI:** Hm...

**HIEN:** Under Garlean rule, no few Domans were conscripted into the imperial army. We would repatriate them in return for those of ours you captured in the recent conflict. Naturally, any exchange would include the acting viceroy.

**ASAHI:** Yotsuyu? What makes you think we have her?

**HIEN:** Forgive me, my lord. Was it not your wish to speak plain? Let us not play games. I desire only to work to our mutual benefit. The Optimates tried─and failed─to take my sister by force. I would succeed by peaceable means, thereby strengthening my party's hand. 'Twould be a lie to say I would not also be glad of my sister's safe return.

**ASAHI:** A fellow plain-speaker. How refreshing. Very well. Your proposal has merit, but I will need time to consider it.

**HIEN:** Of course, my lord. May we remain in Doma until you have come to a decision?

**ASAHI:** You shall be our honored guests. Yugiri, I leave the ambassador and his retinue in your care. See that they are well looked after.

**ISSE:** You have our gratitude, Lord Hien. We shall look forward to your answer.

**ASAHI:** (-???-)Get back! I'm warning you!

**ISSE:** Someone's in trouble! Are you all right?

**YUGIRI:** Aye...

**ISSE:** What do they want with you?

**ALISAIE:** Yugiri!? And you lot, too!? I─ I don't know. We were returning from the enclave when they came at us.

**ASAHI:** It seems they won't go quietly.

**AZAMI:** And neither will we. That seems to be the last of them. You have nothing to fear, child. You are safe now.

**ISSE:** Thank you, sir...

**ASAHI:** You saved us again. Thank you. If you're ever passing by our village, look us up. You'll always be welcome.

**ALISAIE:** Thank goodness we arrived when we did.

**ASAHI:** Indeed. But what could have prompted the Red Kojin to stray so far from the Ruby Sea?

**YUGIRI:** I presume these are the sellswords hired by Yotsuyu? If so, the answer is simple: desperation. Bereft of imperial employment, they seek other means to line their coinpurses. Another sad legacy of the Empire's mismanagement.

**ASAHI:** The Empire to which you have sworn allegiance.

**000:** Must you always be so pointed? If we are to bring about lasting change, we must look beyond narrow allegiances. You have every right to doubt me, but in time I hope you will come to see that we share a common goal. You and yours have fought fiercely to change the Empire from without, but if we are to end the cycle of conflict, the Empire must change from within. Am I wrong?

**ASAHI:** What will you say? Not about that. True reform can only come from within. The Empire will never change.

**HIEN:** I knew you would understand. You have witnessed such change firsthand, after all, during your time in Ishgard. Never? I wonder, would you have said the same of Ishgard? ...Believe what you will, but I assure you: the Empire *can* change.

**YOTSUYU:** I had her brought here in secret while the three of you kept our guest company. The world has not been kind to you, it is true. But that does not excuse your sins. You should be at the bottom of the river. Yet here you are, the living, breathing proof of my failure. A failure for which I would now make amends.

**GOSETSU:** What did I do? I don't remember. Was it really so terrible? Tell me, please! What did I do!?

**HIEN:** You speak of sins, my lord, but at whose feet do those sins lie? With the soldiers who committed the crimes, or those who commanded them to do so? With both, I would say, for all have a conscience, and all must choose. But with no memory of who she is or what she has done, what sin remains to be cleansed?

**GOSETSU:** You ask that I show mercy?

**HIEN:** I ask why the heavens saw fit to deny me my rest. Why Yotsuyu was spared not only death but the bitter memories of her life.

**GOSETSU:** You truly think it the will of the kami... If so, her life is not mine to take. It is yours to safeguard. Come the hour of the exchange, if her memories have not returned, she may remain here in Doma to live out her days as Tsuyu. But if they do, the Garleans shall have their viceroy. Though the people will protest, they will come to accept my decision when they have been reunited with their loved ones.

**HIEN:** Thank you, my lord.

**ASAHI:** Now, then. I believe we have kept our guest waiting long enough. Did Gosetsu not seem strange to you? His sympathy for Yotsuyu apart, I mean. I know his powers of endurance only too well, but after all he has suffered, even he should not be on his feet. He puts on a brave face for our sakes, but it would not surprise me if he lacked the strength to raise his blade. ...Though I suppose if he and Yotsuyu are to enjoy a life of peace and quiet, he will have little use for it. It falls to us to shape that future. One in which he need never again set foot on the battlefield. My apologies. Our deliberations took longer than expected.

**HIEN:** Think nothing of it. The time afforded me the opportunity to go on a rather rousing excursion through Yanxia. You have reached a decision, then?

**ASAHI:** We are willing to cooperate with you in combating the eikon threat, and also in the exchange of prisoners. Assuming you accept our conditions, of course. As you know, your sister is in our care. Due to certain complications, however, we are hesitant to release her into your custody.

**HIEN:** Complications?

**ASAHI:** She was inside Doma Castle when it collapsed. Though she survived, she remembers nothing of her past life─not even her name. To clarify, she is in our care not as a prisoner, but as a vulnerable citizen of Doma.

**HIEN:** Are you saying you refuse to release her?

**ASAHI:** Not at all. If her memory returns before the appointed hour.

**HIEN:** And if not, what exactly...? You will accommodate her here in Doma?

**ASAHI:** Well, I sincerely doubt she will be of any great strategic value to the Empire. She spends her days daydreaming of dango.

**HIEN:** *Dango*...? ...How dreadful. Very well. In light of our recent...misstep in Sakazuki, it seems only fair that I show you the same understanding you have shown us. ...Though I do have one, small request. Regardless of Yotsuyu's value to the Empire, she is yet my sister. Before I leave, might you permit me to speak with her in private?

**ASAHI:** Of course. Perhaps you could even bring her a plate of dango. She would be most pleased. Yugiri will see you to her chambers. I wish you a safe journey.

**RESISTANCE:** This has been a most enjoyable visit. I look forward to our next meeting. Maxima, would you take the others and see that all is ready for our departure? I simply cannot leave without first giving thanks to the Warrior of Light for accompanying me through Yanxia. Mark me, savior of the savages. There will be a reckoning.

**ASAHI:** You've nowhere left to run, traitor!

**RESISTANCE:** Ignorant savages. Killing us will avail you naught. For every imperial you cut down, a thousand more will come. Abandon this foolish endeavor and surrender. You may yet serve our righteous cause.

**ASAHI:** How dare you speak of righteousness! You who forsook kith and kin to serve conquerors! Be glad I grant you this mercy. What in the...? Reinforcements? ...No─just one. Cut him down!

**ZENOS:** Thank you. Thank you, sir!

**ASAHI:** This one is...promising. Who remains to offer us resistance?

**ZENOS:** A...a host of rebels led by Lord Kaien hold the enclave across the river.

**ASAHI:** Lord Kaien.

**ZENOS:** The king of─th-the *former* king of Doma, sir. They say he is one of the greatest swordsmen alive.

**ASAHI:** Is that what they say.

**WOUNDEDIMPERIAL:** Who...was that...?

**ASAHI:** Surely you jest? That was Zenos yae Galvus, legatus of the XIIth─the crown bloody prince! I'd heard he was strong, but that...that was frightening.

**HIEN:** That was...Lord Zenos...? Everything you are─your power, even your face─it vexes me. Go on. Lash out like the beast you are. At an emissary. And jeopardize the newfound peace between Doma and the Empire. My lord was destined to lead us unto a glorious new age. Your light is nothing to his radiance. I will cherish this moment─lock it away within my heart─until the day we meet again.

**ALISAIE:** You look troubled, my friend. Was it something he said?

**YUGIRI:** Of all the memories to witness.

**HIEN:** I had my doubts about him, but I would never have guessed he was a disciple of Zenos. My lord─

**YUGIRI:** Calm yourself, Yugiri. I set no store by him or his enlightened brethren. But if by treating with them there is even the faintest hope we might secure the return of our conscripted brothers and sisters, I must play this game. After the way I risked their lives in the rebellion, I owe them that much.

**HIEN:** My lord, you bear no blame for their fate.

**YUGIRI:** If not blame then responsibility. They were prisoners and still I chose to fight, knowing they could be executed in retaliation. But now we have a chance to bring them home. If it means bargaining with a monster, so be it.

**HIEN:** My lord...

**ASAHI:** Besides, I think he likes me. Which is more than some can say.

**YOTSUYU:** Can you truly remember nothing? Nothing at all?

**ASAHI:** Were we...friends...?

**YOTSUYU:** Yes. We were good friends, you and I. In fact, I've brought you a gift. I pray that one day soon, as you gaze into that mirror, you will remember the woman staring back at you.

**001:** It's so pretty... Who are you...? Who are you...?

**SYSTEM:** *nil*

**IMPERIALDOCTOR:** Meanwhile, in the imperial capital...

**ROBEMAN:** How are you feeling, my lord?



---------------------------------------------------------------------




---------------------------------------------------------------------

**GOSETSU:** Open wide, now...

**YOTSUYU:** Please, Tsuyu. I am not so frail that I cannot feed myself. Ah, I grow weary of the taste of gruel...

**GOSETSU:** You don't like it? Can I fetch you something else?

**YOTSUYU:** Aye. Wine! Or if that is not “wholesome” enough─I don't know...a sweet persimmon from Namai? I enjoyed them in my youth.

**GOSETSU:** A persimmon.

**ALISAIE:** Nay, pay me no mind─I am full. Besides, we have guests.

**GOSETSU:** I hope we are not interrupting your meal. We had heard you were confined to bed, and thought you might welcome some visitors.

**YOTSUYU:** Confined to─ A gross exaggeration! A trifle drained from my exertions, perhaps. But with a little rest, I shall be fighting fit again in no time!

**ALISAIE:** Take off your clothes.

**GOSETSU:** Gosetsu! Is this how you've been spending your time!?

**YOTSUYU:** My lady, I assure you, this is not─

**ALPHINAUD:** Off with them. We need to wash you─you stink!

**GOSETSU:** What are all these scars? There are so many of them...

**YOTSUYU:** A life of battle will leave its mark upon a man... Is something wrong, Tsuyu?

**GOSETSU:** It's nothing. I'm fine.

**ALPHINAUD:** Bah, leave me be, woman! I will not be fussed over like some newborn babe!

**E3F2VILLAGERE:** Greetings. Might I have one of y─ Wait! Please!
...I only wanted a persimmon.

**E3F2VILLAGERF:** Kami save us! Her spirit has returned!

**ISSE:** She's back from the dead to seek her revenge!

**YOTSUYU:** It can't be! She couldn't have survived!

**ISSE:** What did I... Wh-What did I do?

**HIEN:** As if you don't know!

**ISSE:** Good people of Namai─be at ease, I pray you! You have naught to fear!

**HIEN:** My lord, forgive me but─what is that monster doing here!? They told us she was dead!

**ISSE:** I too was surprised to learn of her survival. More even than you, I would hazard. 'Twas I who cut her down. I who left her to her fate. But it would seem the kami had other plans. By some miracle, both she and Gosetsu were spared when the keep collapsed─though Yotsuyu's preservation came at the cost of her memory.

**E3F2VILLAGERF:** You're saying she's *forgotten*? Forgotten everything she's done!?

**E3F2VILLAGERE:** Lies! Lies, my lord! She would say anything to escape punishment!

**YOTSUYU:** What does it matter!? *We* have not forgotten her crimes! And we demand justice! I beg of you, Lord Hien, draw your blade and rid us of this canker!

**ISSE:** What I saw, then. It's all true. I'm sorry! I'm so, so sorry...

**AZAMI:** You're “sorry”!? And what, we're supposed to forgive you?

**HIEN:** Here, there's no need to cry. Can't you see how scared she is? How can you be scared of her? She's not the same.

**AZAMI:** Until such time as her memories return, this woman shall be known as “Tsuyu,” and treated as a citizen of Doma. I will, however, see that she is watched at all times. Rest assured that there will be no more unannounced visits to the village. As your lord, I ask that you leave her fate in my hands, and suffer her to live. For now.

**ISSE:** Please, Isse...

**ASAHI:** All right. I'll keep my peace. As long as you're happy. That's all that matters.

**HIEN:** What a pleasure it is to see you once more, Lord Hien. Not to mention my dear sister.

**ASAHI:** A pleasure to see you too, Ambassador. Forgive us our late arrival. You have our people aboard the airship?

**HIEN:** Exactly as agreed. We would leave you in no doubt as to the purity of our intentions. I daresay it was the selfsame spirit of cooperation which prompted you to bring Yotsuyu here today.

**ASAHI:** Indeed. Before excluding her from the exchange, I thought it only fair that you see her condition for yourself. Physically, she is in fine health, but her mind is unchanged.

**ASAHIFATHER:** So I see. But all need not necessarily be lost. In anticipation of this tragic turn of events, I took the liberty of inviting some special guests...

**YOTSUYU:** (-???-)Ah, Yotsuyu! You look...well.

**ASAHI:** Of all the people...

**YOTSUYU:** Is something wrong, dear sister? These are our beloved parents. Does not the sight of them bring back sweet childhood memories?

**ASAHI:** ...Gosetsu. I have to take this to Gosetsu...

**HIEN:** Hmph. It would seem my little surprise was not sufficient. You needn't glare at me so, Lord Hien─I merely did what any loving son would do for his family. Lest you doubt, I am content to leave the acting viceroy in your care. Pray treat her as you would any daughter of Doma. Do not grow too fond of this place, dear sister. You will come back to us ere long.

**ASAHI:** We continue with the exchange as planned, then.

**HIEN:** Very good. The structure across the river should serve our needs. We shall await you there with the conscripts if you would bring your captives...?

**GOSETSU:** Agreed. Until then, Ambassador. Gosetsu, are you awake?

**HIEN:** My lord! Come in, come in... When Tsuyu returned, her eyes were red from weeping. She spoke not a word─simply sat and peeled some fruit she'd brought for me. She then claimed weariness and retired to her chamber. Tell me, what happened to upset her so?

**ALISAIE:** The ambassador arranged a surprise reunion with her foster parents. A misguided attempt to restore Yotsuyu to her senses. It was plain their presence caused her great distress, but she seemed otherwise unaffected.

**GOSETSU:** Yotsuyu was mistreated as a child, was she not? It was a cruel trick to use her tormentors like that, knowing the pain it could cause.

**HIEN:** Hmph. I like this Asahi less and less...

**ALPHINAUD:** Be that as it may, he has agreed to allow Yotsuyu to remain with us in Doma. Our primary concern now is to hand over the prisoners without incident, and bring our people safely home.

**ALISAIE:** There was one other detail at the meeting which caught my attention. I assume you all noticed the rather suspect crates within the castrum? The imperials were quick to retrieve them afterwards, but I wonder...

**HIEN:** Out with it, Brother. You fear they might contain bombs or war machines?

**DOMANMAID:** If the ambassador wanted me dead, he has had ample opportunity. No, assassination is not his intent, but we should be on our guard for other acts of treachery.

**GOSETSU:** My lord! Forgive me, but the lady Yotsuyu─she's gone!

**DOMANMAID:** Gone!?

**HIEN:** I beg your pardons, my lords. I was certain she had fallen asleep...

**ASAHIFATHER:** No, no, the responsibility is mine. 'Twas I who gave her a room instead of a cell. She may simply have wandered outside. We will organize search parties. Might I call upon your assistance?

**YOTSUYU:** (-???-)Help... Help... Help... Help me...

**ASAHIFATHER:** If only I hadn't remembered. He should *hate* me. But I will not suffer his kindness. Not after what I did to him.

**ASAHIMOTHER:** Who's there!?

**ASAHIFATHER:** <gasp> ...Oh, it's you. What are you doing out here in the dark?

**ASAHIMOTHER:** This is the enclave, is it? When the soldiers dragged us back to Doma, you were the last person I expected to see.

**ASAHIFATHER:** You're the bane of our existence, Yotsuyu! A font of misery! You couldn't even do us the simple courtesy of dying, could you! Oh no, you had to *live* and taint us with the shame of your failure! We had a perfect life in the capital! And now they're making us wallow in this muddy ruin like common swine! I don't deserve this!

**YOTSUYU:** Now, now, dear, that'll do. There seems little point in berating the girl when she scarcely remembers her own name. Our time would be better spent contemplating how we're to survive this unhappy predicament. You've kept your looks at least. I suspect you'd fetch a handsome price with the right buyer. Maybe enough to get us to Kugane and start a new business...

**ASAHIFATHER:** Ah, my beloved parents. No sooner do I wake from gentle slumber than the world returns in all its cruelty. Yes, this is how it always was. How it was meant to be. Very well. If I cannot escape my nature, then I shall embrace it. To the very depths I have sunk, my soul steeped in spite and rotten to the core. The self-righteous hide behind “justice,” but I need no such mask. Father. Mother. Was it not you who made me into this monster? Who taught me the truth of this miserable world? For years I knew naught but the taste of pain and humiliation, but the time has come to savor my vengeance against Doma. Against all my enemies. And it begins...with you!

**ASAHIMOTHER:** Yotsuyu...? What...?

**ASAHI:** No!

**YOTSUYU:** Well done, dear sister. Did I not say you would come back to us?

**ASAHI:** Brother dearest. What a surprise. You always were a cold-blooded little worm. I doubt you thought twice about sending our parents to their deaths.

**ASAHIFATHER:** Your dagger yet drips with their blood and you presume to judge *me*? To be frank, I didn't think you had the strength to slay them so cleanly. A single thrust each... I'm impressed! But surely you can't be satisfied with murdering a pair of doddering elders. You yearn for a deeper vengeance...and the power to see it through.

**HIEN:** Please... I don't want to die...

**ASAHI:** Any sign of her? ...What happened here? I knew what would happen if she recovered, and *still* I did nothing. ...You say she left with her brother? Whatever he wants with her, he was willing to pay for it with his parents' lives... But this is neither the time nor the place. We must gather the others.

**HIEN:** At last, the hour has come. The conclusion to these negotiations will mark a new beginning for Doma and the Empire─a first step on the road to peaceful coexistence!

**ASAHI:** Indeed. We are ready to proceed with the exchange when you are. Forgive my curiosity, Ambassador, but is there a purpose to these containers you bring with you?

**HIEN:** Oh, the supply crates? They are filled with materials we hoped might be of use in Doma's restoration. I meant to gift them to you at our last meeting, but we had so much else to discuss...

**YOTSUYU:** How very generous. I confess, I had not expected such compassion, welcome though it is. ...But then I was *also* surprised by the news that one of our captives had delivered herself into your custody ahead of time─a minor discrepancy I shall overlook in the spirit of the occasion.

**HIEN:** Are you perhaps referring to me, Lord Hien?

**YOTSUYU:** Yotsuyu.

**HIEN:** Orphan of the Naeuri, widow of Sashihai... ...And acting viceroy of Doma! You and your people are mine to govern; mine to punish!

**YOTSUYU:** Well, well. It would seem your shattered mind is mended. As per our agreement with the ambassador, you are free to return with him to the Empire. Your authority as acting viceroy, however, is no longer recognized here.

**HIEN:** My position is not for you to decide, little lordling. All who resist the rule of the Empire must be purged. Such was the order given to me by Lord Zenos himself! I will reign here in this putrid, pestilent swamp until the last of you has been broken! This land shall know no dawn. I will spew forth darkness and drown all in eternal night. And high above you I shall shine uncaring, cold and distant as the moon!

**ALPHINAUD:** What has she done!?

**ASAHI:** Oh, gods... This is a summoning!

**MAXIMA:** A Doman citizen has called forth an eikon in direct violation of our primary agreement. The negotiations have failed. Abandon the captives, and make preparations to withdraw.

**ASAHI:** But, Ambassador...

**MAXIMA:** Disobey me, Pilus, and you disobey the Emperor. Make preparations to withdraw─*now*.

**YUGIRI:** ...As you command.

**HIEN:** My lord! You must fall back!

**000:** You ask me to run!?

**HIEN:** What will you say? Leave this to me! A strategic withdrawal!

**YUGIRI:** Bah... Against such a foe, I would be more hindrance than help. The field is yours! Spare my pride, would you? I know this foe is beyond me. The field is yours! We will withdraw...but not without our countrymen. I want every soul accounted for. Every soul!

**TSUKUYOMI:** My lord!

**YOTSUYU:** (-???-)I knew you would not flee. I see now the strength which flows from that baleful light of yours. (-Tsukuyomi-)But I am become Tsukuyomi, goddess of the moon and divinity of night. What power can compare to such celestial majesty!? I shall plunge all I despise into darkness! And within that black abyss, even your light shall flicker and fail. Come, let us cast the stalks and look upon the fate of Doma. I see a future in which the sun sets on this wretched land once and for all!

**YOTSUYU:** You really must learn to finish the job. 'Tis true that a gaudy mirror and a handful of crystals make for a feeble summoning, but even the weakest eikon is a god of sorts. A threat that must be put down. My, my, such hostility! These beings are the sworn enemies of the Empire─I merely did my duty as an imperial officer. Will you surrender to anger, then? Slay an anointed emissary to avenge a fallen foe? You cannot, of course. To do so would burn the bridges we have labored so hard to build! Ah, but I'm forgetting: they're already ash! This *Doman* woman has seen to that! The Empire cannot ally itself with any nation that refuses to renounce summoning. I believe I was most clear on that point! It should have been mine. The power he bestowed upon her... I should have been the one to govern Doma! *I* would have repaid his faith! No one alive loves him more than I! Instead, this *harlot* betrayed his trust! *Useless...piece of...filth*! Worthless whore!

**ASAHI:** Thank you, dear brother...for this precious gift. Vengeance. These people...*our* people...they ignore the corruption which festers beneath the surface. Cast aside that which is dirty and broken. Speak not of things which would disrupt their dreary little lives. Like you, Asahi...always pretending not to see. You were the first...the first I swore to kill.

**000:** Ahhh...such bliss. I had thought my hunger insatiable...but now...now I am satisfied. You should feel honored, dear brother. I saved the last of my strength just...for you. What's the matter? The witch of Doma will soon be dead.

**YOTSUYU:** What will you say? Gosetsu will mourn you. Tsuyu deserved a kinder fate.

**ASAHI:** He will mourn Tsuyu, perhaps... Her happiness was never to be... Not in this world. I wonder... Was the fruit as sweet...as he remembered...?

**ROBEMAN:** Lord Zenos... Lord Zenos! I am at your disposal.

**ASAHI:** (-Zenos-)Asahi. You were born of Doma, yes?

**ROBEMAN:** Yes, my lord! I am honored that you would remember me. How may I serve?

**ASAHI:** (-Zenos-)You are hereby appointed ambassador plenipotentiary, and empowered to speak with the voice of the Emperor. Return to your native land of Doma, and announce your intention to sue for peace.

**ROBEMAN:** ...For peace?

**ASAHI:** (-Zenos-)Once negotiations are underway, you are to locate the acting viceroy.

**ROBEMAN:** She *lives*? That is to say─I will, my lord.

**ASAHI:** (-Zenos-)When you have found her, you will initiate a ritual to call forth an eikon. I will instruct you in the necessary steps. (-Zenos-)Yotsuyu's faith is unreliable. But as a child raised to believe in the kami, she will serve as a vessel for one of the Kojin's gods. She need only wish it to be so. (-Zenos-)The power will seem a gift, but the eikon's essence will consume her. She will be no more than a husk, a slave to whim and desire.

**ROBEMAN:** My lord, ever since the day you saw fit to save my miserable life, I have dreamed of repaying your benevolence. Upon my honor, I swear to devote myself wholly to your service. All that you command will be done, no matter the cost. B-But...I fear the subtleties of your plan yet elude me. From the reports I have heard, the champion who aids the Doman resistance would make short work of a single eikon...

**ASAHI:** (-Zenos-)The eikon is merely a message. The pacifist teachings of the Populares spread through this city like a plague, and I would remind the people of the threat we face. (-Zenos-)You will be my chosen agent─the hand which tolls the warning bell. The salvation of this world will not be won through the signing of treaties.

**HIEN:** Your chosen agent!? I will not fail you, my lord! My... My master... Lord Zenos... He will come...for you.

**GOSETSU:** You have prevailed, I see!

**HIEN:** She is gone. Wherefore did the kami spare us only to inflict this pain...?

**MAXIMA:** Death shall not want for company this day. You spared us a worse disaster, but I fear our fledgling peace with the Empire was beyond saving.

**HIEN:** Lord Hien!

**MAXIMA:** Maxima, is it not? I assumed you long fled.

**000:** I entertain thoughts of escape even now. But our negotiations have yet to reach a satisfying conclusion. The ambassador insisted that the summoning spelled an end to our mission here, but it seemed to me there was more to the tale...

**MAXIMA:** What will you say? I saw a vision of Asahi's past... Zenos was behind this plot.

**HIEN:** I have heard tell of this power you wield. And in your vision, you witnessed Lord Zenos giving these orders?

**MAXIMA:** But how can that be? Zenos is dead. He took his own life after the battle in Ala Mhigo. I saw his body with my own eyes!

**ALPHINAUD:** Forgive me, but Lord Zenos is very much alive─he granted our party an audience prior to our departure. That he was gravely wounded is certain, but his recovery appeared to be proceeding apace.

**MAXIMA:** I am afraid I share Lord Hien's confusion. The man's death was confirmed and his remains interred. These are matters of public record.

**HIEN:** ...Hmm. I have no doubt you believe what you say. But what then is the explanation? That an impostor has infiltrated the innermost circle of the imperial court? The idea is inconceivable, *absurd*...but worthy of investigation nonetheless. Our movement can ill afford to have a highly placed pretender undermining our efforts...

**MAXIMA:** Your efforts may yet bear fruit. Tell me, what is to become of our prisoner exchange? Though we have already taken custody of our conscripts, we have yet to release your imperial comrades. Do you still intend to collect them?

**HIEN:** Ah. Yes, as the late ambassador's second-in-command, it falls to me to speak on the Empire's behalf. And I am happy to confirm our intent to proceed according to the original agreement.

**MAXIMA:** Then let us be about it. 'Twould be a pity to abandon such a promising beginning.

**HIEN:** Indeed. You have my thanks, Lord Hien. As soon as our people are secure aboard our airship, we shall depart straightways for Garlemald.

**ALPHINAUD:** Tread lightly, Pilus. I sense treachery awaits you there.

**ALISAIE:** Might I accompany you to the capital?

**ALPHINAUD:** Alphinaud! Have you gone mad!?

**MAXIMA:** Impostor or no, if Zenos was instructing Asahi on the finer points of ritual summoning, then experience tells us there is an Ascian waiting in the wings. Without our knowledge and expertise, our new friends will be hard-pressed to contend with a foe for whom death is but a minor inconvenience. They need our help.

**HIEN:** Were you indeed willing to share your knowledge of this enemy, we would not shun your counsel.

**ALPHINAUD:** You truly mean to do this? In full knowledge of the danger?

**000:** I have seen the Warrior of Light risk his life on countless occasions. Next to him, I am scarce more than a distraction on the battlefield. I have seen the Warrior of Light risk her life on countless occasions. Next to her, I am scarce more than a distraction on the battlefield. But in the meeting room or the audience chamber, *there* I can make a difference. I can strike bargains, forge ties, and change minds. And where better to do these things than in the home of our old enemy?

**HIEN:** What will you say? This is your moment! I believe in you, Alphinaud!

**ALISAIE:** 'Tis not for me to stop you─but I would have you consider an alternative arrangement. Rather than braving the Empire as a simple traveler, go forth as an emissary of Doma. Such a position should offer you some measure of protection.

**ALPHINAUD:** Go, then. You've obviously made up your mind. Just try not to do anything reckless, all right?

**HIEN:** I shall be on my best behavior. Farewell, my friends.

**GOSETSU:** How often have I imagined this moment... Thank you for helping it come to pass.

**ALISAIE:** Ah, there you are.

**YUGIRI:** Gosetsu, your hair!

**GOSETSU:** My friend... What have you done...?

**HIEN:** An old man who cannot raise his blade has no place in the service of a young lord. Thus did I decide to devote my remaining days to pilgrimage. I will walk this land, offering prayers of repose for all the souls who left this life in suffering.

**000:** ...All of them?

**GOSETSU:** What will you say? Safe travels, Gosetsu! Don't leave us, Gosetsu!

**HIEN:** A fulsome farewell makes for an enjoyable journey! This is no forlorn and final farewell! Send me on my way with a smile, my friends!

**GOSETSU:** Scarcely have we said our good-byes to Alphinaud, and you leave us too. Ah, but 'tis well that my companions find their own way forward. I must endeavor to do the same.

**HIEN:** I have faith that you will find the best path for Doma without me, my lord. Pray forgive me this last act of selfishness, and grant me your blessing.

**GOSETSU:** You have earned it. A thousand times over! Go in peace, my friend. I shall make of Doma a land where children laugh and none need live in fear.

**THANCRED:** There is no better way to honor those who went before... And with that I take my leave!

**ALISAIE:** Oh dear. We seem to be missing a corpse.



---------------------------------------------------------------------




---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALISAIE:** Gods, I needed that.

**THANCRED:** I won't bother telling you to catch your breath. Whatever brought you galloping back to us, I assume it's urgent.

**ALISAIE:** Quite. Without further ado, then. After the successful uprisings in Doma and Ala Mhigo, rebels in several other provinces were inspired to follow suit. Unfortunately, they did not fare quite so well. The Dalmascans paid the heaviest price. For their defiance, the Emperor made a show of razing their capital to the ground, prompting many of their neighbors to abandon thoughts of resistance. But not all have given up on liberty. Heartened by the news of Doma's prisoner exchange, some still believe that the Empire may one day be amenable to negotiation. We have the shinobi to thank for spreading the good word. They have worked tirelessly to keep the subjugated informed, and a little knowledge can go a long way.

**THANCRED:** There is at least a spark of hope, then.

**ALISAIE:** A spark in want of kindling, yes. The Alliance has already begun supplying materiel to resistance movements abroad, many of whom would otherwise struggle to continue the fight. The support effort is being led by the sultana and the Elder Seedseer, who have both seen enough Ala Mhigan refugees to know the consequences of oppression. And for their troubles, they have quickly earned a reputation as folk heroes in certain corners of the Empire. That is all for the provinces. As for the Garlean motherland itself... Our friends the Populares have suffered something of a setback, I regret to say. Talk is rife that Doma has summoned a primal, and the Empire's more liberal voices are being drowned out in the fearful clamor for retribution.

**THANCRED:** And who do they think orchestrated this summoning!?

**ALISAIE:** Oh, any but those truly responsible. Zenos has seen to that. Speaking of whom, the crown prince is recovering *remarkably* well. Well enough, in fact, to enable him to personally tour the provinces, putting the fear of the Emperor into the hearts of any would-be dissidents.

**THANCRED:** He walks in plain sight? And none suspect him? Then it's as we feared...

**ALISAIE:** Yes. An Ascian wears his skin. ...But it was not that which brought me here in such haste. During my time in the provinces, I learned many things, yet at no point did I hear any report of a Doman emissary in the capital.

**THANCRED:** But Alphinaud should have arrived by now. Could they be holding him there in secret?

**ALISAIE:** The possibility did cross my mind─but I have reason to believe he never reached his destination. As you know, Scions assigned to covert operations, such as Riol and myself, are issued special linkpearls for communication in the event of an emergency. I mention this because it was originally Alphinaud's task to coordinate the response at headquarters─meaning he has one. And whose voice should I hear when mine recently crackled to life...?

**THANCRED:** You spoke with Alphinaud!?

**ALISAIE:** Spoke with, no. I but heard his voice─and none too clearly at that. Two words were all I could make out. “The Burn.”

**THANCRED:** The wasteland on the edge of Othard? Something must have happened to them there! There's no time to waste! We must make for the Burn at once!

**ALISAIE:** I had a feeling you might say that.

**THANCRED:** And? I can't very well sit around here drinking tea if Alphinaud is in trouble. You said yourself that this linkpearl was only to be used in emergencies. So I'm *going*, and that's the end of it.

**HIEN:** Well, far be it from me to change your minds.

**YUGIRI:** Between contending with bloodthirsty beasts and sand in my...every conceivable place, I'm quite ready to leave this wasteland. But first things first... Do you see the crashed ship over yonder? Judging by its class, it must be the vessel that bore Master Alphinaud away.

**ALISAIE:** Warmachina. It would seem they were involved in a struggle. There may be clues. We should split up and search the area.

**YUGIRI:** There's no sign of Alphinaud. Nor of Maxima and his people.

**YSHTOLA:** Hm. These were no ordinary soldiers. Over here! The insignia on this man's uniform identifies him as one of the Emperor's personal guard.

**HIEN:** Handpicked soldiers answering only to the royal family...

**ALISAIE:** That would explain why all the casualties are Garlean. They were fighting their own.

**000:** You're saying the Emperor was behind all this? That Alphinaud is his prisoner?

**HIEN:** What will you say? We don't know that yet. Alphinaud is fine, I'm sure of it.

**YUGIRI:** Aye, we must not jump to conclusions. Besides, Alphinaud is more than capable of looking after himself, is he not?

**ALISAIE:** I suggest we return to Doma to consider our options. Whatever happened here, Master Alphinaud is long gone, and any subsequent search may safely be left in the hands of the shinobi.

**YSHTOLA:** Where in the world are you, Brother? If you die on me, I will never let you hear the end of it.

**LYSE:** Lyse! What brings you here?

**HIEN:** Oh, Alliance business. We have a request for Doma─well, Hien. But that can wait. They told me you were out searching for Alphinaud. Did you manage to pick up his trail? Well, if he wasn't at the crash site, he might still have escaped. We have to keep searching!

**ALISAIE:** And we will. Alphinaud embarked on this journey as an emissary of Doma, and I hold myself responsible for his safe return. I will have our shinobi in the provinces search for him as a matter of urgency. Chin up, Alisaie. You'll get to admonish your brother for his recklessness yet.

**LYSE:** Well, someone has to do it.

**YUGIRI:** I'm sure he's going to be fine. There is one thing I'm *not* sure about, though. You said it was the Emperor's personal guard that attacked Alphinaud's airship. But the Populares would never have been able to arrange the prisoner exchange without Varis's blessing. So why would he sabotage his own mission?

**HIEN:** They may not have been acting on Varis's orders. The guard answer not only to him, but to his family. The crown prince, included.

**YSHTOLA:** When Yotsuyu summoned Tsukuyomi, Asahi was quick to proclaim that a Doman citizen had violated the terms of our agreement. That the negotiations had failed. And it is this version of events that is now being repeated across Garlemald. To hear the tale, one would think the prisoner exchange never took place. Plainly, someone is manipulating matters from the shadows. Most likely Zenos─or whoever it is that wears his face.

**HIEN:** Whichever Ascian, you mean. We all know the nature of our adversary.

**LYSE:** The servants of chaos are true to their name. Their meddling has cost Doma a chance at peace. Whoever it was that loosed his personal guard, the Emperor cannot be ignorant of these developments. We must proceed on the assumption that our treaty is indeed in tatters. But come, Lyse, you have journeyed far. Let me hear your petition.

**HIEN:** Right, so, the big news is that Ala Mhigo has agreed to join the Eorzean Alliance. To make it official, and discuss where we all go from here, the leaders of the five nations are planning to hold a meeting, and we were hoping you might come too. We've already seen what we can achieve when we work together, and the Alliance hopes to work even more closely in future. They think it's our best hope of keeping the Garleans in check─and I agree.

**LYSE:** As do I. By coordinating our efforts in the east and west, we may be able to discourage them from committing their forces to a single front. I accept your invitation. I must, however, ask for time to attend to some pressing matters here. In light of recent events, the risk of imperial reprisals is greater than ever, and I would not leave Doma unguarded. Ere I depart, I must shore up her defenses.

**HIEN:** Understood. I'll let the Alliance know. We'll wait to hear from you before setting a date. The meeting's to be held at the Royal Palace in Ala Mhigo, incidentally. Do you remember the way?

**LYSE:** Well enough. Please assure my hosts that I will not keep them waiting any longer than I have to.

**YUGIRI:** Consider it done! And thank you for agreeing to come. If we all put our heads together, we're sure to find the best way forward. For everyone.

**HIEN:** If we are to ready ourselves for invasion, we shall need manpower, provisions, and time. All of which are in notably short supply.

**YSHTOLA:** Candid as ever, Yugiri. And correct, I concede. Fortunately, I have an idea. 'Tis plain no single nation can stand against the might of the Empire. And it was only with the aid of others that Doma succeeded in winning her freedom. So I mean to take a leaf out of our Eorzean friends' book and form an alliance of our own. In addition to those with whom we already share an understanding, I would reach out to Hingashi and Sui-no-Sato, and further afield, to the myriad peoples of Nagxia and Dalmasca. I am under no illusion─not all will answer the call. Yet disparate though we may be, we are united in our desire for freedom. If our neighbors could be made to see what is at stake─Ascian machinations and all─cooperation need not be so far-fetched a notion.

**HIEN:** ...It may even seem practical. Under the guidance of our former leader, Master Louisoix, we once strove to unite the fractious city–states of Eorzea. I daresay that experience shall be of use in your endeavor.

**ALISAIE:** We should be glad of your wisdom.

**YSHTOLA:** For the record, I would have been in favor of this plan, even if it *hadn't* been my grandfather's, but I have to ask: how will we secure the time to carry it out? Not that anyone has forgotten, but the Garleans have airships. Lots and lots of airships. Should they catch wind of our plan, they could send an armada to overwhelm us before our alliance had even begun to take shape.

**ALISAIE:** ...Not if we deny them access to the skies. During our time in the Burn, the Warrior of Light and I chanced upon some Allagan ruins.

**YSHTOLA:** Oh?

**YUGIRI:** As such ruins go, they were not particularly unusual, but something about the surrounding land struck me as odd. Faint though it was, its aetherial residue was uncannily similar to that of Azys Lla. Identical, in fact. For locations so far removed to share a single aetheric signature is all but impossible. I conclude therefore that the Allagans created the floating continent with land taken from the Burn.

**YSHTOLA:** While that is a most intriguing theory, I fail to see what relevance it has to Doma's defense.

**ALISAIE:** Azys Lla was enclosed in a powerful energy barrier, impenetrable even to an Agrius-class battleship. It occurred to me that those ruins may have enjoyed similar protection. I have no proof, but the Warrior of Light *did* report seeing a structure resembling other known Allagan field generators. It occurred to me that those ruins may have enjoyed similar protection. I have no proof, but the Warrior of Light *did* report seeing a structure resembling other known Allagan field generators.

**HIEN:** All right, but even if we could put up such an energy barrier, it surely wouldn't extend beyond the limits of the Burn. So what's to stop the Garleans flying around it?

**ALISAIE:** ...Fuel. The Dalmascan capital, Rabanastre, was a key imperial refueling point in the East. By laying waste to it as a lesson to the rest, the Empire greatly hindered its own operations in the region. If an imperial fleet were to advance upon Doma, it would now have little choice but to travel as the crow flies─over the Burn.

**YSHTOLA:** I see!

**HIEN:** A word of caution. Even assuming the generator still functions, raising a barrier of such a scale will require a prodigious amount of energy. And few places are so bereft of suitable crystals as the Burn.

**YSHTOLA:** Hm... A source of energy. Tell me, did the Allagans make a habit of launching things into the sky?

**HIEN:** A curious question. Besides Azys Lla, I know of only one other notable instance: the red moon Dalamud, whose fall triggered the Calamity.

**ALISAIE:** Just the two occasions, you say... Then I believe I may have a solution to our energy problem.

**HIEN:** ...You do?

**YSHTOLA:** I *may*. To find out for sure, we would need to visit the Azim Steppe. ...Which would, I now see, present the perfect opportunity to discuss an alliance with the Xaela tribes. How very neat! What say you, then? Shall we see whither this road leads? Ahhh, I will never tire of this vista! The endless fields, the boundless skies... 'Tis a sight to make a man forget his cares.

**HIEN:** But not his purpose, I trust. Might this be a fitting moment to tell us what we are doing here?

**YSHTOLA:** Of course. During my time with the Mol, I learned some few myths of this land. One goes thus... “In the distant past, when all seemed doomed, a wayfaring soul came unto the steppe. Venturing into the northern crag, he received of Nhaama a sliver of her essence─a shard of the shining moon─and with it clove the tainted land from the earth. “The end thus averted, to these fields did the wayfaring soul return. And venturing once more into the northern crag, he buried the shard, and made unto the heavens an offering of blood.”

**HIEN:** A tainted land cloven from the earth, and an offering of blood to the heavens... Azys Lla and Dalamud.

**YSHTOLA:** That was my thinking, yes.

**HIEN:** And you believe that yonder mountains hide an artifact possessed of sufficient power to raise Azys Lla up to the heavens. ...I suppose that might suffice.

**YSHTOLA:** Worth a closer look, would you say?

**HIEN:** I would. Such an abundance of aether!

**YSHTOLA:** Are we in luck?

**HIEN:** We are. This is an Allagan artifact, most likely built to regulate the flow of aether. I strongly suspect the ancients used it to stem the flow from here to the Burn. That would explain how they were able to untether what became Azys Lla from its surroundings. But were we to throw open the floodgates, the resultant deluge would surely be sufficient to raise our wall. And in restoring the flow, we may also restore life to the wasteland. Hm...?

**YSHTOLA:** What is it?

**SADU:** While the device itself harbors a surfeit of aether, the opposite is true of the surrounding area... An effect of regulation, perhaps? A similar phenomenon seemed to be occurring in Doma... Whatever the explanation, the answer will not reveal itself here. We have seen what we needed to see. Let us return to Mol Iloh.

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, this spot shall serve as well as any. I shall enjoy this, khagan!

**SADU:** Is this truly necessary? Have you no peaceable way of making decisions?

**YSHTOLA:** Speak not of peace. You stand before proud warriors of the Dotharl. In the heat of battle do our souls burn brightest! We lay low the strong that we may rise higher! That is our way─the way of might! There is no other!

**HIEN:** ...Well, they do not want for conviction.

**SADU:** Indeed. It's what makes them such dangerous enemies...and such useful allies.

**MAGNAI:** Enough talk! It is time to fight! Yes! YES! Not since the Naadam has my soul burned so! Come! We have only just begun!

**HIEN:** Enough. You were not granted leave to set the Steppe ablaze.

**SADU:** Well, well! The sun has come out to play!

**MAGNAI:** Begone, moonstruck Oronir! I am busy.

**SADU:** Fool of a Dotharl. Have you forgotten the face of your master already? The Sun will never set! From his seat on high, he reigns over all, now and forever! Yet what should he find here but a battle to determine the fate of the Steppe─a battle waged without his blessing! This will not stand! You, Doman. You who come to petition the warriors of this land forget that all Nhaama's children are wards of the Oronir. As first among my brothers, your petition is mine alone to judge.

**MAGNAI:** These words are as wind from a horse's backside. Plentiful. But your axe sings more sweetly. Let her speak for you.

**HIEN:** Insolent child. You will learn your place.

**MAGNAI:** Forgive me, Brother Magnai, but we have an arrangement with the Dotharl. We will not abide any interruptions.

**SADU:** So be it. The Sun will pass judgment on all. Daidukul─join me.

**MAGNAI:** The Sun is in good company. We may dance alone.

**YSHTOLA:** Beg not for mercy, for you will have none. Bear witness to the power and the glory of Azim!

**SYSTEM:** Constantly at each other's throats, like rabid...dogs. Gods, I'm turning into her. Ahem. I have not the patience for this. But if we must fight, let us at least be brief. Come!

**SADU:** In the coming battle, you will fight as Y'shtola.

**MAGNAI:** Ahhh, never have I felt such bliss in defeat! 'Twas a battle to burn soul and flesh to ash. We Dotharl will lend you our strength as promised. Nhaama's power is yours to wield. What does the Sun say to that?

**HIEN:** Hmph. The Sun is not driven by base motives such as yours. But aye, they have been judged...and found worthy. It is the way of the Oronir to accord recognition and respect to the strong. You have made sufficient proof of your strength. The Sun shall answer your call.

**MAGNAI:** You have our thanks. We are glad to call you allies.

**YSHTOLA:** You. By what are you called?

**MAGNAI:** Y'shtola. Why?

**YSHTOLA:** Are you...? Are you my Nhaama?

**MAGNAI:** I beg your pardon?

**YSHTOLA:** In battle, you shone with all the majesty of the full moon's light, your healing touch the embodiment of the Dusk Mother's love. Long had I wondered if my Nhaama might not be a woman of the Steppe. Beholding you, I am all but certain! Now, look into my eyes. Could it be...? Could you be...?

**MAGNAI:** I am...not interested, little sun. Try again when you have become a man.

**SADU:** Little...?

**YSHTOLA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Little sun! Little sun! Does it pain you, little sun? Crave you salve to soothe the ache? Fire to sear the wound in your heart?

**HIEN:** We have wasted enough time here. Cirina waits for word of our success.

**YSHTOLA:** Did it work?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** It did. Aether may flow freely to the Burn once more.

**RAUBAHN:** Mistress Lyse. Commander Aldynn. It gives me great pleasure to formally welcome the city-state of Ala Mhigo to the Eorzean Alliance.

**KANESENNA:** The pleasure is ours, Your Grace. I know I speak for all Ala Mhigans when I say that we are glad of this chance to stand with our comrades of the Alliance.

**HIEN:** And we for our part are glad indeed to be able to welcome friends both old and new...

**AYMERIC:** Lord Hien of Doma, at your service. Pray accept my heartfelt thanks for your generous invitation.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Nay, 'tis we who must thank you for journeying so far. And 'twould be remiss of me not to acknowledge the part the Scions of the Seventh Dawn have played in bringing all of us together. In times of great unrest, you and yours have been our constant companions, without whom we would not be here.

**RAUBAHN:** With apologies to Lord Hien and Mistress Alisaie, it occurs to me that we have not gathered in this way since that fateful day in Ul'dah.

**ALISAIE:** The day I lost my arm and my freedom... As I lay in my cell, never did I dream that I would one day be given the chance to represent my homeland at this council. I would not even be alive had you not plucked me from the jaws of death─you, Yugiri, and Alphinaud. Would that the lad could be with us...

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I too owe my presence here to Alphinaud. In so many ways... Until such time as he returns, I mean to carry on his good work as best I can.

**KANESENNA:** Come, friends─let us leave the past in the past, and turn our eyes to the future. My lord Hien, pray tell us how things stand in the East.

**MERLWYB:** Having heard the rumors of dissent in Garlemald, I dared to dream of a peaceable solution...

**AYMERIC:** Hm. The Empire will not so easily change its ways. If the Garleans have a mind to take back Doma and Ala Mhigo, we'll be hard-pressed to stop them. Even with the might of six nations. But while we lack the strength to fight the tide, a course may yet present itself if we read the winds aright.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** The winds suggest but one course to me─one which leads from the sea unto the river and thence to the source of all our woes.

**AYMERIC:** The Ascians.

**RAUBAHN:** Indeed. All here have felt their blighted touch. It was the Bringers of Chaos who nurtured the archbishop's tyrannical ambitions... They who bestowed upon him the secrets of summoning, as they have so many others, before and since. And while they remain, we shall know no peace.

**THANCRED:** Our objective is clear. The question is how to achieve it. That our enemy parades about in Zenos's skin poses problems in itself, but ere we get to them, how are we to infiltrate the Empire and get close enough to strike?

**YSHTOLA:** While I see the wisdom in targeting the Ascians, an assassination attempt on Garlean soil would do little to aid our cause...even were it to succeed. It's time we used our enemy's preferred tactic: subterfuge.

**MERLWYB:** You have an idea?

**THANCRED:** Speak your mind, Master Thancred. None here know the enemy better than the Scions, and you mayhap best of all. Whatever it is you propose, we will give it fair hearing. On that you have my word.

**RAUBAHN:** Very well, Admiral. My proposal is thus. We dispatch the shinobi to imperial territory. There, they sow the rumor that the crown prince perished in the battle for Ala Mhigo, and that the man parading around is in fact a corpse inhabited by a servant of darkness.

**LYSE:** Well...it does have the ring of truth about it. And were the Garleans to learn that their future ruler is a puppet, the Empire would be shaken to the core.

**THANCRED:** But─at the risk of sounding stupid─would they actually believe such an unlikely story? I didn't.

**HIEN:** Ordinarily not. But prior to his miraculous recovery, rumors of Zenos's death had already begun to circulate around the Empire. Ultimately, however, what the masses believe is not our chief concern. Our true objective is to create an opening for rival factions within Garlemald to exploit.

**THANCRED:** Just as a war of succession erupted in the wake of Emperor Solus's death!

**HIEN:** A war which raged until but recently, plunging the imperial house into disarray as nephew and uncle grappled for the throne. It is no coincidence that one of Varis's first acts as Emperor was to name Zenos heir apparent─family feuds being so tiresome when armies are involved. Not all welcomed his choice of successor, however. There is no shortage of individuals who aspire to the throne─who would jump at any chance to seize power. The news that Zenos is not only dead, but a puppet to diabolical forces, would be too enticing to ignore.

**THANCRED:** The Empire would not be quick to recover from a second war of succession.

**HIEN:** I am no stranger to infiltrating imperial territory. With a team of operatives gathered from among the Alliance's finest, the plan should have a reasonable chance of success.

**MERLWYB:** Doma already has shinobi in place throughout the provinces. We stand ready to act, and act we must. What say you all?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I am for Master Thancred's proposal. We shine a light upon the Ascian and test the Empire's unity. 'Twas his plot that scuttled Doma's negotiations, was it not? Why then, if we can eliminate him, there may yet be a chance for peace. Let us wage this war of subterfuge, that we may one day lay down our arms. Gods know, we never will while the Ascians remain.

**000:** That way...sorrow... History...must be changed...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Who is this? I don't understand...

**RAUBAHN:** Ahead looms a Calamity. Ahead looms Light, expunging all form and life. Twin dooms only you can forestall. Only you.

**ALISAIE:** What's the matter!?

**MERLWYB:** There's...there's a voice...

**KANESENNA:** Spies in our midst!?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Nay. I sense no such presence.

**YSHTOLA:** Let expanse contract, eon become instant... Throw wide the gates that we may pass!

**AYMERIC:** Is it over?

**KANESENNA:** Master Thancred!

**RESISTANCEHEALER:** Twelve forfend... Bear him to a private chamber. Have every healer make ready. Swiftly!

**LYSE:** Master Thancred remains in slumber. Though his vital signs appear stable, he is unresponsive.

**RESISTANCEHEALER:** What could have done this? And why just him and not the others?

**LYSE:** I'm afraid we could not identify the cause, my lady. Our examinations revealed no wounds, nor the presence of any poisonous substances...

**ALISAIE:** Gods, that only makes it worse. You're to let us know the moment there's any change, all right?

**KANESENNA:** Thank you for coming. Knowing Thancred, he would apologize for being otherwise engaged at so crucial a juncture.

**YSHTOLA:** In gifting us a course of action, Thancred sowed the seed of all that is to follow. We have but to nurture it as best we can. To him I would say rest easy, that he may wake to enjoy the fruits of our labors. Now, the matter of the mysterious voice must not be forgotten. Will you tell me exactly what happened?

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie and I heard a voice in the moments before Thancred collapsed. It was accompanied by a severe headache─as if something were clutching at our minds. Did you experience the same thing?

**KANESENNA:** ...So, in between the voice and the pain, you felt as if you were somewhere else entirely?

**YSHTOLA:** Your testimony confirms my suspicion. That which you experienced was, I believe, your soul being plucked from your flesh. *Called*.

**KANESENNA:** Called?

**ALISAIE:** I myself examined Thancred. Reach out as I may, I could not sense in him the spark of life that is his soul. That Thancred alone was stricken so is likely due to his heightened sensitivity to the effects of aether─a consequence of his prior possession by the Ascian Lahabrea. The owner of the voice, whoever it may be, reached out to you─called your souls─and in so doing caused you and yours such pain.

**KANESENNA:** But...if that's true, where exactly are we being called *to*?

**YSHTOLA:** I know not. Yet one thing is plain: whoever waits for you on the other side is possessed of a power unlike any I have ever known.

**LYSE:** Forgive us, Lyse, but may we leave Thancred in your care for a time?

**YSHTOLA:** As if you had to ask. I may not be a Scion anymore, but I'm no less a friend. Don't worry, I'll see to it that Thancred's well looked after. Just focus on solving this mystery, all right?

**ALISAIE:** Thank you, Lyse. As the Elder Seedseer says, 'tis no ordinary individual we are dealing with. Nor can we discount the possibility of Ascian involvement.

**URIANGER:** Whoever or whatever is behind this, the sooner we find out the better. Urianger! Gods it's good to see you!

**YSHTOLA:** Would that our meeting were under happier circumstances. I judged the voice sufficient cause for concern even before you sent word of its effect on our comrade...

**URIANGER:** You heard it too, then?

**YSHTOLA:** Aye. And all but certainly at the selfsame instant. Alas, pained as I was, I could make little sense of what few words did then reach mine ears.

**URIANGER:** Who do you think is responsible? Could this be the Ascians' doing?

**ALISAIE:** That I cannot say. Not when so little is known. Ere I indulge in speculation, I would examine Thancred with mine own eyes.

**YSHTOLA:** To Ala Mhigo, then─without further delay!

**URIANGER:** One other thing. During my visit to the Far East, I observed a strange phenomenon.

**YSHTOLA:** Thou referest, I presume, to the localized reduction in aetheric density?

**URIANGER:** Well, that spares me the trouble of an explanation. Yes. I noted precisely that at two apparently unconnected locations. I take it the phenomenon is not limited to the Far East?

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed not. Of late, our agents charged with surveilling the beast tribes have spoken of little else. In every corner of the realm, they tell of places in which the aether hath grown thin. Naturally, my suspicions first turned to primal activity, but the areas thus affected betray no evidence of summoning. I must confess to being quite perplexed.

**URIANGER:** If the same phenomenon is being observed in multiple locations on opposite sides of the world, we may safely discount regional factors. Needless to say, this warrants further investigation.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed. I shall make it my task to─ The voice... It calleth to me once more...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I...I hear it too!

**ALISAIE:** Only you... Only you...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Ah! Unnngh! No...! Y'shtola... Urianger...

**ALISAIE:** Throw wide...the gates...

**MAELSTROMOFFICER:** No! NO! This can't be happening! Y'shtola! Urianger! Open your eyes! Open your eyes, I beg you... Say something...anything... Not again... Please! Not again!

**ALISAIE:** Here he is, my lady.

**GABU:** Ga Bu...it's been too long.

**MAELSTROMOFFICER:** ...

**ALISAIE:** I'm afraid there has been no change. If he can see or hear us, he has given no sign...

**000:** I see. You're still fighting. I'm proud of you. We promised that we would come and visit you together, didn't we. Alphinaud and I. I'm sorry that we haven't managed that yet. You know, with the three of us like this, does it not remind you of that night? Of the stars beyond count, twinkling in the heavens? I was feeling pretty low back then. Powerless. But I knew that my brother was close by if I needed him. And that the others would be waiting for me back at the Rising Stones. Not like now. I've seen my share of trouble since coming to Eorzea. ...Been reminded again and again of my limitations─of how little I can change about this world. And I've come to know the sorrow of parting all too well. But to have the people I hold dear struck down before my eyes, and be powerless to help them...? That─ That I cannot bear.

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? You still have me. You don't have to bear this burden alone.

**SYSTEM:** And for that I am grateful. I don't know what I'd do without you. ...No. I don't. You're right. It's pure arrogance to imagine I can solve everything by myself. You'd think I'd have learned that by now. Thank you. I don't know what I'd do without you. Well, that's more than enough brooding for one day. Come on. We have friends to save.

**ROBEMAN:** Meanwhile, in the imperial palace...

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** (-Zenos-)The Populares no longer present an obstacle. Now is the time to bring the Empire's might to bear. (-Zenos-)A word from Your Radiance is all it takes. But *one word*, and the imperial army will fall upon Ala Mhigo as a pack of bloodthirsty wolves and tear that feeble nation apart. (-Zenos-)Have you no words for me? (-Zenos-)Despite the lengths I go to─an emissary, playing the part of a fool. (-Zenos-)When first I took this face, I swore to use all of my knowledge, all of my power, to further the cause of the Empire. My deeds stand testament to my commitment. (-Zenos-)And with this adamant flesh at my disposal, I could destroy the eikon-slayer as easily as one might swat a fly. Why do you hesitate? No subtitles, reported if displayed. (-Zenos-)Our enemy is resourceful. Though victory is certain now, it will not remain so indefinitely. Deliberate if you must, but be quick about it. We will speak again when you have unburdened yourself of doubt. Until then, I take my leave...Father.

**VARIS:** (-???-)I should be the one to sigh. (-???-)I played my part to perfection. I had earned my rest. And then, thanks to Lahabrea's crowning act of idiocy, our favorite emissary sees fit to summon me back. (-???-)Elidibus was ever a worrier. A most tiresome trait, would you not agree? (-???-)What, have you no words for me either? No matter. I've long grown weary of this mummery. (-???-)Now, my dearest grandson. Let me remind you of your place, in the simplest of terms. (-???-)... (-???-)You do not make judgments─you administer them. Swiftly and to the letter. Naught else is your concern. (-???-)Elidibus may be an insufferable bore, but he is no fool. His choices as emissary seldom err. (-???-)If aught threatens the balance 'twixt Light and Dark, it falls to you to remove it. (-???-)Be it by your own hands or by your armies, you have ample means at your disposal. That is why this empire exists─why *I* built it. Oh dear. Have I touched a nerve? You always were an easy one to read. I pity you, I do. As they say, ignorance is bliss. And I know how much happier you would be not knowing the things you know. The founding father was an Ascian! And he created the Empire solely for the purpose of sowing the seeds of chaos! Don't take it personally. I merely do my duty. To bring about a Calamity requires no small amount of power. And there is no surer way to obtain such power than by collecting powerful pawns. To that end, I have labored long and hard, and I must say I am quite pleased with my handiwork─paltry though it seems in comparison to Allag.

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** You fiends are overfond of your own voices. Mark me, Ascian. Man is the master of his own destiny!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**HIEN:** Make ready, friends. We are come to the Burn.

**SUZAKU:** Everyone! Land where you can! We must wait out the storm!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**KRILE:** I'm glad you've come, though I'm afraid there's little in the way of good news. After you left, we reached out to both the Alchemists' Guild and Stillglade Fane, and attempted all manner of treatments... But the results were always the same. Whatever the answer is, it's not alchemy or conjury... Why did it have to be Y'shtola and Urianger, and not me? Out of all of us, they are the ones who could feasibly have solved this puzzle. And Alphinaud's still missing. Gods, it's all going wrong... Where do we even start?

**ALISAIE:** (-???-)A grave situation, indeed. Might I be of some assistance?

**KRILE:** Krile! I thought you busy delving into the mysteries of Eureka... Krile! I did not think you well enough to travel...

**ALISAIE:** When word reached me of the plight of our friends, I could not well stay away. As a fellow Scion, not to mention your erstwhile mentor, this is one of those times you should feel free to call on me─regardless of my personal circumstances.

**KRILE:** I... Yes, I should have thought of that. Thank you for coming, Krile. We would welcome your insight.

**ALISAIE:** And I should be happy to provide it. Now, what's this I hear about Alphinaud heading into imperial territory? That boy always did have some funny ideas. Do you remember the speech he gave when he was accepted to the Studium?

**KRILE:** “My life's goal is naught less than the salvation of this star!”

**ALISAIE:** [LAUGHTER]

**KRILE:** [LAUGHTER]

**ALISAIE:** That particular grand pronouncement has been a source of great embarrassment to him, as you know. But the fact of the matter is, he meant every word, and has lived his life accordingly.

**KRILE:** Yes, he remains altruistic to a fault. But I'm worried he was too fixated on his goals to see the dangers, as has happened before...

**ALISAIE:** You needn't be so concerned. Though his values remain the same, Alphinaud is not the blinkered boy he once was. Slowly but surely, his eyes have been opened─thanks to a certain someone. A certain someone whom he'd be mortified to learn had heard about his little speech. Mum's the word, eh? Right, I had better have a look at our patients. They're in the infirmary, I assume? I'll need absolute quiet, so it would be best if I did this alone. If you'll excuse me... All three are in fine physical health. At a glance, I would say they were merely sound asleep... ...Except for the fact that I couldn't sense the slightest trace of “them” in their bodies. It's as if their souls have taken leave of their physical forms.

**KRILE:** Ah. Yes. The Elder Seedseer made a similar observation.

**ALISAIE:** I've read the report. When you heard this mysterious voice, you described feeling as if you were “somewhere else,” yes? If we assume the aether which comprises your essence is being drawn to some other place... Then it may be possible to follow the trail it leaves behind, just as we did in our search for Thancred.

**KRILE:** I wasn't around for that. But I can't imagine it was easy.

**MATOYA:** Oh, it wasn't. But that's no reason not to try. I will have need of Master Matoya's Crystal Eye if I'm even to make the attempt, so I suggest we pay her a visit.

**ALISAIE:** Come to disturb my peace again, have you? I hide myself away in a cave, and *still* you people insist on pestering me with your problems. Oh. I mistook you for young what's-his-name, but I see now you're the sister. Weren't you supposed to be the lively one? I've seen happier faces at a rain-sodden burial.

**MATOYA:** Well, I'm sorry to dash your expectations, but the situation isn't exactly conducive to gaiety.

**KRILE:** Ah, that's more like it. Shtola used to spit and hiss like a wildcat, too. Better for a young thing like you to be filled with fire, and leave the doom and gloom to your elders. Now, what exactly does this tragic situation of yours have to do with me?

**MATOYA:** If I may, Master Matoya, we have need of your Crystal Eye once more...

**KRILE:** And Shtola is one of the afflicted, is she? Very well. She may be an ungrateful stray, but she's *my* ungrateful stray. And I'll not see her buried before I am.

**ALISAIE:** Right. Let us see what we can see. I'll begin from where our friends first fell, and cast my senses out from there...

**KRILE:** ...What is it? Did you find them!?

**ALISAIE:** Th-This doesn't make sense. How is it even possible...?

**KRILE:** How is *what* possible!? Krile, what did you see!?

**ALISAIE:** Th-The threads, they just...they just ended. And, no, I didn't lose track of them─I followed them as far as they went. It's as if─ It's as if they were cut off.

**KRILE:** Could their aether have dissipated? If it had─ Oh gods... Their bodies are just husks. It's like the broodmother's daughter all over again...

**MATOYA:** No, no, this is different. The Qalyana girl was already dead, body and soul, when Lakshmi effected her resurrection.

**ALISAIE:** Aye, let's not jump to conclusions. If their physical forms yet breathe and show no signs of wasting, then it follows that their souls must still be intact somewhere.

**MATOYA:** But *where*!?

**ALISAIE:** That's the question, isn't it, girl? Death has not taken them to the aetherial sea, yet there are no tracks left for us to follow.

**MATOYA:** We're no closer to an answer than when we started. But knowing their souls are still out there is progress of a sort. We just have to keep looking. Pray excuse me a moment. Yes? ...I remember, but─ ...What, to *Ala Mhigo*!? We're on our way! That was Lyse. Apparently, a group of Populares have defected to Ala Mhigo, and Maxima─the envoy Alphinaud left with─is one of them! I'm sorry, I realize we've barely begun here, but...

**KRILE:** Go, child, go. You've made up your mind, and life's too short for dithering.

**ALISAIE:** I'll do some digging in the meantime, and see if there isn't some other method we could use to continue the search.

**MATOYA:** Let's be off, then!

**ALISAIE:** Bah, not again... The enchantment barely seems to take, these days. I'd chalk it up to old age, but I rather doubt it's that simple.

**MATOYA:** Before they...took ill, Y'shtola and Urianger were sharing notes on a “thinning” of the aether. It seems to be happening all over.

**LYSE:** Does it now? And here I was, all set to blame my woes on that creaking mountain of refuse clogging up the Thaliak. I fear something has gone awry. Still, there's naught to be gained from starting at shadows. You can only do what can be done, and that but one thing at a time!

**MAXIMA:** I'm sorry to drag you halfway across the realm, but when Maxima mentioned Alphinaud, I thought you'd want to hear the news in person.

**ALISAIE:** Ah, we meet again...though I was hoping our reunion would be under more auspicious circumstances.

**MAXIMA:** What happened to my brother? Where is Alphinaud?

**ALISAIE:** Never fear, my lady. Your brother was in fine health when I took my leave of him, and I have no reason to assume that has changed.

**MAXIMA:** You *assume*!?

**ALISAIE:** If you will allow me, I shall endeavor to explain events. Our troubles began not long after we departed Doma. While crossing the Burn, we were fired upon by the Emperor's personal guard, and forced to make an emergency landing. As we stumbled from the wreckage, our attackers fell upon us again, and we would have perished there and then were it not for the intercession of a third party... A band of mercenaries whose leader claimed to pursue a vendetta against the Ascians. This “Shadowhunter,” as he styled himself, then escorted us out of the wastes to relative safety. Upon arriving back in civilization, I gathered my Populares colleagues and prepared to flee the Empire. Master Alphinaud, however, declined the invitation to join us, preferring to continue his investigation into the Ascian threat.

**MAXIMA:** Well...at least he's not lying in a heap in the Burn. Tell us more about these Ascian hunters. Who are they? And is Alphinaud still with them?

**RAUBAHN:** He is. As to who they are, I am afraid I have nothing to tell you. Beyond the fact that they root out and destroy Ascians, they were unwilling to divulge anything which might serve to identify them. They would not even reveal their next destination...but Master Alphinaud asked to accompany them all the same. Since parting company with your brother, we've been engaged in a game of cat and mouse with the Emperor's guard. We made our way through province after province, finding the army busy “restoring order” wherever we went, until we finally arrived here in Ala Mhigo. I cannot thank Commander Aldynn enough for giving us such an unexpectedly warm welcome.

**MAXIMA:** I'm not inclined to turn away refugees, no matter which land they call home. And if they can tell me how things lie in Garlemald...all the better.

**LYSE:** On that subject, there is much I would tell you. During the course of our journey, we heard tales that an entire rebel army had been slaughtered in the space of a single night. It would seem my former comrades grew tired of putting down uprisings in the conventional manner, and chose instead to bring a formidable new weapon to bear. Details were sparse, but the rumor alone was enough to dampen the flames of rebellion. I have also heard reports that several companies have withdrawn from their designated provinces and begun marching westward. It is my assessment that the Empire's forces are mobilizing for a large-scale military engagement.

**RAUBAHN:** Westward? You mean they're getting ready to invade Ala Mhigo!?

**LYSE:** We knew this was coming. But not that it would be so soon.

**RAUBAHN:** We've barely even begun to shore up our defenses! They won't stop an invading army!

**LYSE:** ...No, they won't. Dispatch messengers to the Alliance leadership requesting reinforcements. And send word to our officers in the field to hasten completion of those border fortifications. Prepare to meet the imperials head-on! No matter how quickly we act, we still want for time. When the enemy comes into view, our best recourse will be to open negotiations with their commander, and see that the ensuing proceedings take as long as possible.

**ALISAIE:** Would you and Alisaie head to Doma and let Lord Hien know about this? I'm sure he'll want to hear about Alphinaud too.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Consider it done. We'll send word when─

**ALISAIE:** ...Untold sorrow... Must be changed... Ahead looms a calamity... Eon become instant. Throw wide the gates.

**LYSE:** You heard it too? Well, at least we're both still standing.

**ALISAIE:** Oh, thank the gods─I thought we'd lost you for a moment there. Why does this keep happening!?

**HIEN:** I wish I knew. Nothing we've tried has brought us any closer to an answer... We'll keep working on it, but first we need to go and see Lord Hien. 

**IRONWORKSENGINEER04500:** It seems the engineers have matters well in hand. Should the barrier work as we intend, Doma will be free to reinforce her allies in Ala Mhigo without fear of weakening her own borders. Honored friends, the time has come to put your hard work to the test! Start the generator!

**ALISAIE:** Node one is operational. Nodes two to eight are reporting similar energy levels. The barrier is forming! ...One thousand yalms. Two thousand. Three thousand. Expansion remains smooth. No fluctuations detected. ...Four thousand. Five thousand! Target altitude reached! The barrier is holding steady at five thousand yalms! We've done it!

**HIEN:** ...Is that an imperial airship? Of all the rotten timing...

**ALISAIE:** But this is a gift, Mistress Alisaie. They can test our new wall for us! Seems solid enough. Though I was hoping for a fireball.

**HIEN:** By the gods... It's Alphinaud! What are you─ Let me go! He has my brother!

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Lower the barrier!

**ALISAIE:** (-Shadowhunter-)Be at ease, girl. The lad is not dead─merely locked in slumber.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** No, not him too...

**000:** (-Shadowhunter-)We could identify no cause and found no remedy. Thus I sought to return him to Doma─and into the arms of Lord Hien himself, it would seem. (-Shadowhunter-)It is a day for fated reunions... (-Shadowhunter-)Would you not agree, adventurer? Or should I address you as the “Warrior of Light”?

**SHADOWHUNTER:** What will you say? Gaius van Baelsar... The Black Wolf...

**ALISAIE:** Aye. Gaius van Baelsar, the Black Wolf. That was the title I was given. One I have long since relinquished. Stand down. The legatus of the XIVth Imperial Legion died in Castrum Meridianum. I am no more than Gaius Baelsar, a man without rank or allegiance.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Impossible! There's no way you could have survived!

**ALISAIE:** Do you remember how it unfolded? How I was deceived by Lahabrea? How I was convinced that reviving the Ultima Weapon would allow me to bring peace to Eorzea? The Ascian used me, as he used so many others─all to further the restoration of his wretched god. Yet even with the might of Allag at my command, you bested me. And as the Praetorium went up in flames, I was content to burn along with it...for a moment, at least. A moment of folly. To surrender my life thus would have been to betray all who died for my cause. It was for them that I dragged myself free of the rubble, and swore vengeance on the Ascians. The Black Wolf has shed his pelt, never to return to Garlemald or her legions. I live now only to exact revenge. My principle quarry was to be Lahabrea, whom I gather you have since ushered unto oblivion. But so many more remain. Long has their kind lurked in the shadows, laboring to sow chaos throughout our world. I would see each and every one dragged into the light and put to the sword. Are the Scions not of like mind?

**SHADOWHUNTER:** In this single respect, perhaps...

**ALISAIE:** Then I shall continue the partnership the boy began, and share what intelligence I have acquired. Among the Ascians, the black-masked ilk are subordinate to those who wear red. This, you already know. Yet among the red there exists a hierarchy. Those set adrift with the shards clearly stand below those still joined to the Source. Nabriales, who once dared to intrude upon the Rising Stones, belonged to the former group. And while he was indeed a dangerous foe, his powers were inconsequential next to the Paragons of the Source. The first was Lahabrea, who plagues us no more. There is also the white-robed Elidibus; and the elusive Emet-Selch, about whom little is known.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** We have files on Lahabrea and Elidibus, but I believe this “Emet-Selch” is new to us...? As I assume my brother told you, we have evidence to suggest that an Ascian now walks in the body of the crown prince. Have you identified this interloper?

**ALISAIE:** Elidibus seems the most likely culprit. As “emissary,” it is his role to maintain the equilibrium between Darkness and Light. Your many deeds in Hydaelyn's name have upset the balance, and I believe he seeks to restore it by throwing his considerable power behind the Empire. As a leader of the Ascians, he is one of our primary targets. It was on the trail of this very prey that the boy and I came across the scene of a failed uprising. In the absence of a single Garlean casualty, we inspected the bodies of the rebels, and the lack of any external injury drew my immediate attention. They had been slain by Black Rose─an alchemical invention of the imperial army. When I yet served as legatus, I ordered its production halted and all stockpiles destroyed. Toxic gas is not a tool of conquest, but of extermination.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Toxic gas!? This must be the new weapon Maxima warned us about─something deadly enough to sweep away all resistance in a matter of hours. Gods, you don't think they're planning to use this in Ala Mhigo, do you?

**HIEN:** Put your fears to rest. We infiltrated the production facility, and destroyed all existing stores of the chemical along with the plant itself. Even should they rebuild the operation, they will not soon manufacture another batch. Regardless, I would draw your attention to a directive we discovered in the plant's records. The document was marked with a recent date, and authorized with the signature of one Zenos yae Galvus.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** A dead man signing the death warrant for thousands. 'Tis bad comedy.

**ALISAIE:** But the tale does not end there─within that same facility was a chamber filled with devices of Allagan design. Cloning technology, we realized. And what should we find in each and every incubator...but a young Emperor Solus. ...All of which prompts the question: were the Ascians responsible for these abominations? Or was it the will of the Emperor? I must know which hand guides the Empire. Though I have given up my rank, I am yet a son of Garlemald...and I will fight for the future of my homeland. It is time I returned to the hunting of shadows. We should focus on our common foe─to reopen old quarrels now would serve no purpose.

**000:** You saved my brother's life, so I'm willing to let sleeping dogs lie. But in truth, it's not my decision to make.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** What will you say? You're right. There are more important matters at hand. We'll settle this another time.

**HIEN:** There was a time when I scorned those who placed their faith in false gods─even as I, in my blinkered conviction, placed mine in Ascian promises. Unlike yours, my strength of will─and my restraint─was found wanting. We shall meet again, Warrior of Light.

**SYSTEM:** So that was the infamous Black Wolf. An unexpected ally, to say the least... Well, I am content to leave the fine-tuning of the barrier to cleverer minds. Let us bid our friends from the Ironworks farewell and see what can be done for Alphinaud back in Doma.

**IMPERIALENGINEER:** Meanwhile, at the Black Rose chemical plant...

**VARIS:** Our supplies of Black Rose have been ruined, but the new plant is already under construction. We should have the first batch ready in time for the offensive, Your Radiance!

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** See that you do.

**VARIS:** Ah, yes! The infamous “Black Rose.” If I recall correctly, Gaius did not much care for the invention. A ruthless and indiscriminate weapon indeed, this airborne poison. It seems you *are* capable of making decisions worthy of your bloodline.

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** With no gift for sorcery, we Garleans must look to magitek to even the odds. If it spares the needless deaths of our soldiers, and serves the cause of this empire, there is no method I would not employ.

**VARIS:** How very noble of you. Truly, though, I must commend you for embracing your role as emperor. You play the part of the determined ruler well. Sometimes, even *I* catch myself believing! A silent agent of death... Now that I think on it, Black Rose may well possess the perfect aspect. Slowly but surely, the deluge of Light has worked upon the aether here in the Source, and the gas should be most susceptible to its influence... Well, I shall leave you to your own devices. Go forth and bloody the land with your grand and glorious war.

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** ...While you do what, precisely?

**VARIS:** Need you ask? I will be doing what all Ascians do.

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** I am well aware that your kind exists only to usher in the next calamity. But you seem oblivious to the harm your singular agenda causes to the Empire. You cannot have forgotten the events which followed your mortal demise. Our homeland was plunged into civil war for your failure to name a successor. The edifice you so carefully constructed was but a hair's breadth from collapse!

**VARIS:** Are you truly so naive? You thought me oblivious to the consequences? Of a departure so painstakingly timed?

**SOLUSZOSGALVUS:** ...It was by *design*!?

**LYSE:** Well, of course it was! Though I will admit the resulting panic exceeded even my wildest expectations. But how can you be surprised? Throwing the world into disarray was the very purpose for which this nation was, as you say, “so carefully constructed.” Now, if you have no further questions, I must be on my way. Since we may not meet again in this lifetime, it would be remiss of me not to offer a word or two of gratitude. I really must thank you for this surplus of vessels. I can mold any host into my own image, but having bodies tailor-made for me in this fashion is so much less tiresome! You dabbled in Allagan cloning techniques, yes? It certainly is a compelling─not to mention entertaining─field of research. And of all the options available, you chose the founding father on whom to experiment! You have a twisted streak to you, Varis. Like grandsire, like grandson, eh? If events play out as planned, this will become something of a family enterprise. You will be the capstone of this world; I, the anchor in the shard. And together, we will give the lie to this star's fraudulent existence! Hm hm hm... Hah hah... Ahahahaha!

**HIEN:** Welcome back, you two. Greetings, Lord Hien! Glad you could join us!

**RAUBAHN:** Glad to be here. I would have come sooner, were our own defenses not in question. But I am pleased to report that our soldiers are assembling for deployment to Ala Mhigo as we speak.

**ALISAIE:** We are grateful for your support. Thanks to the efforts of our allies, it won't be long before we've established defensive positions on this front as well.

**LYSE:** Ahem, we have some good news too... Alphinaud has come back to us. As for the bad news...

**RAUBAHN:** So, Alphinaud won't wake up, Gaius van Baelsar is alive and hunting Ascians, and the Empire is planning to poison us all with toxic gas. Does that sound about right? Ordinarily, any one of those things would have left me in shock, but the way things have been lately, it's all starting to seem pretty normal. Getting back to your report, are we sure this “Black Rose” is the weapon Maxima was talking about?

**LYSE:** It fits the description. And it seems we have Alphinaud to thank for sparing us an early demonstration of its effectiveness. I've a feeling this won't be the last time his bravery in the Empire will serve us here in Eorzea. The threat of an unknown weapon has had us all on edge... But now that we know what we're dealing with, we can take steps to defend against it.  As for Gaius...I'm not sure what to think. Am I happy he's alive? Not in the slightest. Am I happy he's hunting Ascians? Aye. I'd have to say I am.

**HIEN:** Oh, speaking of Garleans-you-didn't-expect-to-see, we have a tale of our own, as it happens. When we sent envoys to the imperial army to request talks, they returned with the message that “Varis zos Galvus” would be attending.

**RAUBAHN:** The Emperor himself? Well, Varis did sanction the Populares' peace mission... ...But knowing that an Ascian walks in his son's skin, I do not see how we can trust him or anyone from that nest of vipers.

**LYSE:** The Alliance would proceed with negotiations regardless, if only to give ourselves more time to prepare. We do, however, require your cooperation...

**ALISAIE:** Ah, right, yes... So...as a condition for the talks to go forward, the Empire has requested that a member of the Scions be present. There'll be a representative from each Alliance nation, of course, but I'm afraid we have to ask that you come along too.

**LYSE:** Gods, Lyse...you know how much I hate politics. But then what choice do I have? Alphinaud and the others aren't going to do it... Very well. I shall attend as the Scions' representative.

**000:** In case you're wondering why I didn't ask you, the Empire also requested the presence of “Eorzea's champion”...

**LYSE:** What will you say? I'll be there. I'm not fond of politics either...

**RAUBAHN:** That's settled, then. We don't know what Varis means to bring to the table, or why he wants you there, but having you close at hand will make all the difference. Oh, you're not, are you? Come on. If Alisaie can put on a brave face, then so can you. Now, we don't know what Varis means to bring to the table, or why he wants you there, but having you close at hand should make all the difference.

**LYSE:** The meeting will take place on the border. Anticipating an early assault, we mean to position the bulk of our forces nearby.

**VARIS:** The Alliance leaders should already be on their way. Once you're ready, we can head out and join them.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Esteemed representatives of the Eorzean Alliance─on behalf of the Garlean Empire, I thank you for inviting me here today. As this parley was convened at your request, I invite you to speak first.

**VARIS:** Very well, Your Radiance. I, Nanamo Ul Namo, seventeenth in the line of Ul, should be pleased to oblige you. As recent events in Ala Mhigo and Doma have made plain, the subjugation and exploitation of neighboring nations is not a sustainable policy. Should this day end in war, you may very well defeat us, but you will never extinguish the people's desire for freedom. Though it may not be in our lifetime, there will be another revolution, another war, and the cycle will continue. Doma has entered into a concord with the nations of Eorzea. A partnership wherein we recognize one another as equals. Garlemald could be afforded similar treatment. You need only set aside your ambitions and join us in paving a path towards peace.

**LYSE:** Hmph! You will not win me over with sophistry, Your Grace. As you know only too well, this *alliance* lacks the strength to keep the peace within its own borders. Even now, your struggles with the beastmen continue unabated. Divided, you sow this fertile soil with the seeds of your differences and reap naught but discord and chaos for your trouble. Eorzea must be united under one leader, one purpose. I would offer you both and bring an end to your strife.

**HIEN:** With all due respect, Your Radiance, the only thing that you offered the people of Ala Mhigo was fear and hopelessness.

**LYSE:** The citizens of Doma can also attest to the meager alms of imperial rule. There is no purpose to be found in a life of oppression, each day more uncertain than the last.

**VARIS:** Our people are willing to die for their freedom. A great many already have. And countless more will, if we don't put an end to this madness here and now.

**RAUBAHN:** We brought order and stability to your lives. This madness and bloodshed is of your own making. You broke the peace, not Garlemald.

**VARIS:** Peace? Order? You kill our peoples, despoil our lands, take everything that is ours. And what? You expect us to lick the boot that grinds our faces into the dirt?

**AYMERIC:** I expect you to weigh the costs. To recognize that countless lives have been lost on both sides in pursuit of a greater good─and to not squander all we have achieved in a fit of petulance.

**VARIS:** Your Radiance, I fear I can personally attest to the dangers of pursuing one's vision with such righteous fervor. For a thousand years, the Holy See of Ishgard waged war with dragons. A thousand years of sacrifice, of sorrow and hate, in which we bathed in the blood of friend and foe alike. Had it gone on any longer, we may well have drowned. Yet we have chosen to raise ourselves out of this bloody spiral, and have since made peace with our former enemy.

**MERLWYB:** So I understand. No doubt the dragons were more receptive to your overtures in the wake of their leader's demise. You speak of peace, yet use war to achieve it. Your father would not have bothered to obscure his intent with honeyed words. He understood that strength is all that matters in the end. Without his clarity of vision, I can but wonder what will become of Ishgard and her people. There was a time when Garlemald too lacked a leader of conviction. Weak and unable to wield magic, we were at the mercy of the strong, from whom we sought refuge in the bitter cold of the north. Were it not for the discovery of ceruleum, and the subsequent development of magitek, we might never have gained the power to take back that which was rightfully ours.

**VARIS:** You speak as if your people were the first to have been driven from their homes. Limsa Lominsa was built by wayward souls in search of a place to call their own. On the shores of Vylbrand we found it, and from those humble beginnings did we grow and flourish. And all without robbing our neighbors of their liberty.

**KANESENNA:** So sayeth the pirate. Am I to believe that you simply asked the kobolds to yield up their lands, and that they were happy to oblige you? That you did not drive them out like rats in the hold of one of the many ships seized by your “privateers”? I will concede that, after centuries of exile, reclamation may be mistaken for invasion. Nevertheless, it is not─and those who till stolen soil have no right to object when cast out in turn.

**VARIS:** Your uncompromising nature rivals that of the Ixal. They too lament circumstances which they themselves perpetuate. Were they but to embrace peace, we would welcome them with open arms. Indeed, some few have done just that, and now receive of the Twelveswood's bounty. Would that your people might learn from their example.

**ALISAIE:** [LAUGHTER] You would dare compare us to the birdmen? You who thought to invoke the Twelve and threaten all of creation? I came here in the hope of finding some speck of common ground, but I see now these discussions will accomplish nothing. Despite what you people may believe, I am not wont to choose the sword over the olive branch. 'Tis but a pity men are loath to accept one without first being shown the other.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Wait, I beg you! This meeting was supposed to be a chance to find a way forward together, not to bemoan the missteps which brought us here. Please─if you truly consider violence a last resort, there must be a way we can come to an agreement.

**VARIS:** As Mistress Alisaie says, we did not come here to bicker over the past, but to discuss how we might strive towards a brighter future. Emperor Varis, may I suggest a short recess, that all present might compose themselves prior to beginning anew?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Very well. I pray this intermission will suffice to move these talks in a more constructive direction. Now then. Who would have the floor?

**MERLWYB:** Before we resume, I wish to offer you an apology. After you graciously accepted our invitation to discuss an armistice, we have done naught but rebuke you at every opportunity. I believe I speak for all of us when I say we are deeply sorry for our discourtesy.

**RAUBAHN:** I'll admit, your familiarity with our affairs surprised me─and served to remind me how little I know of yours.

**HIEN:** I think all here can understand the desire to reclaim one's homeland. But why expand further─that is my question.

**LYSE:** If I may─the answer can be found in the imperial doctrine they took great pains to impart to my people. Recognizing the threat eikons pose to the world, Solus zos Galvus decreed that they were to be eradicated. To this end, he began a campaign to unite all lands under the Garlean banner. Or so we were taught. Yet the Emperor only reached the Burn─the barrens said to have been laid waste by eikons─after conquering all the lands that lay between. What is more, I am quite certain the practice of summoning was not nearly so widespread in the days before the Empire's founding.

**VARIS:** When you put it like that, it all starts to sound like an excuse, doesn't it? But to distract from what? Why are you really waging this war?

**LYSE:** ...Finally, you ask the right question. I can but hope you heed mine answer and at last accept the righteousness of our cause. My goal is this: to return the world to the way it once was. The way it was always meant to be. In doing so, mankind will be made whole once more. No longer will we suffer from the dissension born of our differences. There will be but one race─a perfect race─as we were when time began.

**VARIS:** What in Rhalgr's name are you talking about?

**MERLWYB:** I am talking about the origins of this star. Of the Source, and its thirteen reflections. At the instant of the great sundering, 'twas not only the world that was shattered, but mankind itself. Thus were we divided into myriad races, each with its own unique imperfections. That is why man looks upon his neighbor and feels fear and hatred. Why he wages war. Why he kills his brother. You all in your own way have proven as much today. The peace you seek is but a fleeting solution to a fundamental problem. One which calls for more drastic measures. To bring about everlasting peace, our worlds must be rejoined. That is the goal the Empire would see realized─the glorious future unto which we shall one day shepherd mankind.

**KANESENNA:** A rejoining of worlds...?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** I have heard this tale of the Source and its reflections before...

**AYMERIC:** Are these not the selfsame desires as the Ascians?

**VARIS:** Emperor Varis! Do not trust in their words. They will lead you to your doom. My father thought to use them, but in the end he succumbed to their temptations. He embraced summoning like so many other pawns before him. Do not tell us you mean to do the same!

**ALISAIE:** [LAUGHTER] To be a pawn, free from the burden of choice, would be a blessing... But I foreswore that privilege the day I learned that the Garlean Empire was built by the hand of an Ascian.

**VARIS:** What!?

**000:** Yes. My grandsire, the former emperor, is of their number. And who better to build an empire capable of bringing about the calamitous change we desire? Would you condemn me for this alliance, for bowing to the will of these shadowy masters, when the prize is true and lasting peace?

**VARIS:** What will you say? Your prize is a lie. Your masters, demons. I will stop you and the Ascians. No matter the cost.

**LYSE:** I come not to conquer, but to liberate─to free man from the prison of divergence. Imagine a world united. One perfect race beneath a single standard. An army before whose might these servants of Darkness and Light would fly as leaves in a storm, never again to meddle in man's affairs. We would be the masters of our own fate! I bid you join me! Not as subjects of Garlemald, but of a new nation! And together we shall win freedom for ourselves and generations yet unborn!

**RAUBAHN:** You want to trigger another half-dozen calamities? You can't be serious!

**MERLWYB:** Have you forgotten how many died? There will be no one left!

**KANESENNA:** Do you truly imagine we would aid you in your bloodletting?

**VARIS:** It is unthinkable! Unconscionable!

**ALISAIE:** And what is the alternative? To be as cattle waiting for slaughter. I would have us work together, that we might take fate into our own hands.

**VARIS:** Into *your* hands, perhaps... But what of the other worlds, Your Radiance? With every calamity, you obliterate a star and every soul that dwells on it!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** To the Ascians, we are all but tiny, momentary specks within an indifferent universe. We cannot hope to oppose them until we have been made whole once more.

**VARIS:** Are these truly the words of Garlemald's ruler? The flaws and foibles which you so abhor are what make us who we are. Every nation─even yours, Emperor Varis─is made whole through the combination of these imperfections, the strengths of one compensating for the weaknesses of another. While it is true that man succumbs all too often to anger and avarice, he may yet overcome his baser instincts through the forming of bonds with others, fostering community and cooperation. That the protector of an empire should not only reject these fundamental truths, but seek to change them at so dear a cost to life is indefensible. Such a man is not fit to govern.

**000:** And you, Warrior of Light? Would you refuse me as well?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** What will you say? I cannot condone such a loss of life. We can defeat the Ascians as we are.

**VARIS:** It would seem the Alliance is of one mind on this matter.

**LYSE:** You Eorzeans never cease to disappoint me. Though I suppose I have only myself to blame for expecting more from savages. This discussion is at an end. I bid you make ready for our next meeting. It will not be at the negotiating table.

**RAUBAHN:** I'm not sure what I was expecting from our meeting with the Emperor, but it wasn't that. Still, at least we know now what he's really after!

**HIEN:** Aye, a future built on a mountain of bodies. I too want the Ascians dead─but not at any cost.

**RAUBAHN:** The last of the reinforcements from Doma arrived not long ago. I pray it will be enough. Given the Emperor's stated goal, this is a battle we can ill afford to lose.

**HIEN:** If the Garleans come in force, we may not have much say in the matter...even with our combined strength.

**RAUBAHN:** We knew from the first that the odds would be against us. But if there is even the slightest chance of victory, we must do everything in our power to seize it.

**HIEN:** We must seize it, full stop.

**RAUBAHN:** Hear, hear!

**ALISAIE:** The two of you are to join an irregular unit and support the main host. I won't bother asking if you're minded to fight.

**RAUBAHN:** After coming this far, how could I not? And for once, there's no one around to countermand me. Not that they would. Not even my brother. But we all know who'll really make the difference. Ready to frighten some Garleans?

**HIEN:** I wouldn't want to be on their side.

**ALISAIE:** Might I ask you to accompany the Doman contingent? They are strangers here, and your presence would do much to raise their spirits.

**YUGIRI:** We would be honored.

**RAUBAHN:** When our people stride out with you in their midst, I daresay the Eorzeans will feel an ilm taller themselves. High spirits have a way of spreading.

**ALISAIE:** Ah, what I wouldn't give to join you. But my duties as field commander will not allow it. I leave the front lines in your capable hands. Comrades! Ready your arms! The hour of battle has come! May the Crystal guide us to victory!

**HIEN:** Since the others couldn't be here, we'll have to fight twice as hard. If Alphinaud wakes to find the imperials have won, I shall never hear the end of it. It's strange... I thought I would be terrified when the fighting started. I *should* be terrified. But with you at our side, I can't help feeling everything is going to be all right. So please... Don't you dare leave me alone. No matter what happens, we have to survive. Together. We did it! I daresay they'll be reeling from this!

**YUGIRI:** You were truly inspiring in battle, my friend. I'm determined not to be outdone, but there seems to be no one left to fight...

**ALISAIE:** A tactical withdrawal, perhaps?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** We should give chase. Finish them off while we have the chance. Imagine the others' surprise when they wake to find the war already won.

**ALISAIE:** The Light...will expunge all life... Only you...can forestall the calamity... Throw wide...the gates...

**HIEN:** No! Not now... Not...like...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**SEIRYU:** Is it sanctum you seek, my wayward children?
Or perhaps you are come in search of power. That which lies at your feet─that blessed bauble─can grant you both.
You need but will it so. Now take up your salvation and begone.
Mortal agency in matters divine shall not be suffered. I am your mother. I am your maker! I. Am. Ivalice!
Consign me unto darkness and your light will be forever lost!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**PANICKEDFIGHTER:** There have been several skirmishes along the border, but as yet, neither side has delivered a decisive blow. We had long assumed that the Garleans would overwhelm us in a straight fight, but we seem to be gaining ground, albeit slowly. As to why that might be... The most likely explanation is that they have yet to commit all their forces. Still, we're winning, and our latest intelligence suggests the Emperor has retreated back to Garlemald. In light of this, we're considering launching an offensive, with the aim of pushing the front line forward, and giving ourselves some room to breathe.

**RAUBAHN:** Commander! The imperials─they've broken through our defenses to the east.

**PANICKEDFIGHTER:** What!?

**RAUBAHN:** Our scouts say their forces are being led by Lord Zenos! Lord Hien and Commander Hext have taken their troops to provide support, but we don't know how long they can hold out.

**000:** So they've been biding their time, waiting for his arrival, have they? Very well. Send word to our allies, requesting reinforcements for the front line. Should the worst come to the worst, I may need to enter the fray myself. But what of you? Do you still have the strength to fight?

**RAUBAHN:** What will you say? You need only say the word. So long as you leave the Ascian to me.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Much obliged. Given the choice, I'd take you over a hundred soldiers. He may not *die* as such, but to see Lord Zenos fall on the battlefield would deal a heavy blow to imperial morale. I'll see to it the men stay clear.

**RAUBAHN:** Why won't they open? Please... I bid you, open...!

**SYSTEM:** What's wrong? Is it the voice again? Are you sure you're in a fit state to do this? May Rhalgr grant us strength... Give them hell, lass. I, for my part, will defend this place to my dying breath.

**HIEN:** Meanwhile, at the border of Ala Mhigo...

**YUGIRI:** [GROAN]

**HIEN:** Fall, fiend! [PAINED SCREAM]

**LYSE:** Yugiri! [PAINED SHOUT]

**RESISTANCEFIGHTER:** Damn you! [PAINED SHOUT]

**HIEN:** [PAINED SHOUT]

**ROBEMAN:** Magic? With a Garlean body? That's hardly fair... Still, he must be stopped...no matter the cost...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Zenos-)Ah, Bringer of Light. It has been too long. (-Zenos-)No words to mark our reunion? ...So be it. (-Zenos-)Equilibrium must be restored... And only your death will redress the balance. (-Zenos-)Your Mother chose Her champion well. (-Zenos-)Yet for all your strength, you will still fail. [DERISIVE SNORT]

**ROBEMAN:** Please... I beseech you...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Zenos-)Hm? Someone calls to you... (-Zenos-)Too late, alas.

**000:** (-???-)At last, I've found you. Please! There is no cause for alarm! ...Though, I confess, this is not where I had intended to meet. But the place of our meeting is of no consequence─like the war you wage. Win or lose, the path you walk leads only to oblivion. The better path leads you here. To me. I have need of your strength.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Who are you!? You have to send me back, now!

**AYMERIC:** I am afraid such questions will have to wait. We have precious little time, and your work is not yet done. The battle is over. The danger passed. But your work is not yet done. Go to the Crystal Tower. I have left something for you near its base. It will serve as a beacon of sorts. One which I pray will help you on your journey. All you need do is find it. I will take care of the rest. Soon we will throw wide the gates... And the path to the First will be yours to walk at last.

**000:** You're awake. Thank heavens!

**AYMERIC:** What will you say? What happened? Where is Zenos?

**000:** Do you recall the confrontation with Zenos? You were the first to come to the aid of Mistress Lyse and the others on the front line. I see you recall that much, at least. In the midst of your duel, it is said you faltered, and that the crown prince seized the opportunity to deliver a mortal blow. Yet before his blade could find its mark, he was distracted by the arrival of a second adversary who bore you away from the battlefield and into the hands of our chirurgeons. Lest you wonder, he left before you awoke. As is his wont. Estinien never was one for emotional farewells. Though Zenos bested all before him, the battle clearly took its toll, for he retreated shortly after your rescue. Seeing this, the remaining imperial forces decided discretion was the better part of valor and pulled back, allowing us to reestablish our position. We have since received word of renewed unrest in the provinces, doubtless inspired by the efforts of the Eorzean Alliance and our Far Eastern allies. Nor does the good news end there. We have also come into possession of intelligence suggesting unrest within the imperial court. This would certainly explain why both the Emperor and Lord Zenos appear to have abandoned the fight. A long-awaited ray of hope in these dark times.

**AYMERIC:** What will you say? Is Alisaie all right? What of the Scions?

**TATARU:** Yet to awake, I'm afraid. But, please...concentrate on your own recovery for now. You have carried the hopes of some half-dozen nations─and we are all eternally grateful for your efforts─but no one is without their limits. Not even you. Leave this fight to us, my friend. You have earned your rest. Ah, but before I forget... I was asked to deliver a message as soon as you awoke. A reminder that you are not alone, though many of your allies have fallen. When you are well and rested, you are to return home, where friends will be waiting for you. Now, if you will excuse me, I must return to the front. May we meet again soon. Under happier circumstances.

**SYSTEM:** By the Twelve, I don't believe it!  [SOFTLY SOBBING] I rushed back as soon as I could. I swear, my heart nearly stopped when I heard you'd collapsed like the others. What in heavens' name is going on? “Win or lose, the path you walk leads only to oblivion.” ...Well, that's helpful. And what else did he say? The better path leads to him? Hmm... If his is the voice you've all been hearing, perhaps the others are with him. Ser Aymeric said the fighting had reached a stalemate, didn't he. But if that monster masquerading as Zenos comes back... Thancred, Y'shtola, Urianger, Alphinaud, Alisaie... You're going to need all of them on your side to defeat him. And I forbid you from going to face him on your own. Do you hear me? So if you must leave... Go and find the others. Bring them home. As for where to start, you said the stranger had left a beacon for you at the Crystal Tower, right? Well, it's not as if you haven't been there before...but I'm guessing “near its base” doesn't narrow things down very much. But how are you to find it now that the tower has been sealed shut? But I'm sure I remember hearing that the tower was blocked off? There has to be a way... If anyone would know, it's Cid and the researchers of Saint Coinach's Find. Don't you worry. We'll find that beacon for you.

**ROBEMAN:** Meanwhile, in the imperial palace...

**VARIS:** (-Zenos-)...I pray you have good reason for abandoning the front.

**ROBEMAN:** How could I remain there while the rumor that my son is possessed by a demon spreads like a sickness here at home? I will not be made to fight for the throne a second time. But what of you? Did you not tell me you would destroy Eorzea's champion with the ease that one might swat a fly?

**VARIS:** (-Zenos-)A minor setback. She will not escape me again. (-Zenos-)Where is your grandsire? I would have words with him.

**ROBEMAN:** How should I know? Do you hide from each other's sight as well? I imagine he is doing what all Ascians do.

**VARIS:** (-Zenos-)Hmmm... He must have found a way to take advantage of this turmoil.

**IMPERIALENGINEER:** Men are not pawns to be played with, Ascian. You underestimate us at your peril. This war will not be decided by you and yours. Man must choose his own fate, and I, for my part, will do all within my power to see Garlemald emerge victorious.

**KATANASOLDIER:** Pray forgive the intrusion, Your Radiance, but the requested preparations are now complete. We stand ready to begin production of Black Rose, upon your order.

**IMPERIALSOLDIER04505:** My enemy. My friend. Had I been but a step faster...

**KATANASOLDIER:** Bloody savages! [PAINED SHOUT]



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**BIGGS:** Look how many people there are! Should we get to it, then? Pick up anything that seems the least bit “device” like, and we'll make ourselves a pile.

**TATARU:** Well if it isn't the hero of the hour! Maybe you'll change our luck─we've found bugger all without you.

**BIGGS:** Biggs! Wedge!

**WEDGE:** Aye, aye, well we could hardly say no to a call for aid from the Scions. Jessie collared the chief for some other business, so we'll be working twice as hard to make up for his not being here.

**TATARU:** Thrice as hard, even!

**BIGGS:** Thank you─both of you! I'm sure we'll find that beacon in no time!

**WEDGE:** Hm. I'm not seeing anything out here. D'you reckon you could squeeze in there, Wedge?

**TATARU:** And get stuck halfway!? No thank you.

**WEDGE:** I could try if you like!

**TATARU:** Tataru, no! We couldn't ask you to do that!

**BIGGS:** Oh, I'll be fine! This receptionist is not afraid to get her hands dirty!

**WEDGE:** Sorry, I-I meant to say─the scholars haven't finished their preliminary assessment of the site yet, so we're not supposed to venture too far in. ...Hm, what's that you got there? Now *that* looks promising!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Uhh...isn't that the Ironworks' symbol? ...Counterfeiters?

**BIGGS:** Now...*now* I have you!

**WEDGE:** You all right?

**TATARU:** What's happening!?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (PANICKED WHIMPERING)

**TATARU:** Stay with me! Focus on my voice! Let expanse contract, eon become instant...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...Wait, this must be it! The device! This is *supposed* to happen!

**TATARU:** Throw wide the gates that we may pass!

**MEMORY:** Safe journey, Warrior of Light. Find our friends, and bring them home!

**MINFILIA:** 聞いて

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Your time has not yet come.

**PEDDLEROFNORVRANDT:** From endless dreams, I awake. Something vague...yet urgent...calls me to action once more.

**000:** Rare to meet someone out here who's not a peddler themself. What brings you into the wilds this time o' night?

**PEDDLEROFNORVRANDT:** What will you say? What do you mean, “this time of night”? But it's bright as day...

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** (CHUCKLE) Well, if it ain't the oldest joke in the book. Me grandad─gods rest his soul─used to tell that one to the barman at kickin'-out time. "An' when, pray tell, did we last have a dark night? Ye rotten old drunk ye!“ he'd reply. (SIGH) "Over a hundred bleedin' years ago, that's when!“ Hm! You've got that look down to a tee. I'd almost think you meant it... Ahhh, got to you, did they? Poor beggar. That explains it, then. ごくり Well, I've roads to travel and wares to sell, but you─you'd best hurry along to the town nearby. Just head east through the trees, and aim for the shining tower. You'll find the place soon enough. 'Tis the biggest settlement for malms around. Go on, now, friend. They'll take good care of you in the Crystarium.

**LYNA:** To dizzying heights it rises, the gleaming spire, its tip threatening to pierce the blinding canopy. There it will all begin anew. Between Dark and Light, the pure and the corrupt─the one true struggle...

**000:** (-???-)Halt. (-Curt Gateguard-)Every face in this city I know. Yours I do not. (-Curt Gateguard-)This is the threshold of the Crystarium, stranger, and I am its gatekeeper. If you would enter, you will answer my questions. (-Curt Gateguard-)From where do you hail?

**LYNA:** Where are you from? Gridania. Limsa Lominsa. Ul'dah. The Source. ...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Curt Gateguard-)Do you take me for a fool? No such place exists. (-Curt Gateguard-)"The Source“? What is this cryptic nonsense? (-Curt Gateguard-)You will not say? Then I have even less reason to trust you. (-Curt Gateguard-)Had you given me an honest answer, I would not have barred your way─we care little here for a person's place of origin. But instead you chose concealment, and I will not suffer you to pass... Hah! (-Curt Gateguard-)That one had eaten. It must have gulped down the whole hand, ring and all...

**LYNA:** (-???-)Everything all right, Captain?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Curt Gateguard-)Quite all right, my lord. Just a stray sin eater, and a weak one at that.

**LYNA:** I see. Weak or not, we should be on the lookout for more. But I see you've met my guest. I will escort her to the Crystarium myself...if you've no objections?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Curt Gateguard-)Another of your mysterious friends, is it? I should have known. (-Curt Gateguard-)Very well. I'll inform the others your guest is to be given the run of the city. (-Curt Gateguard-)Pray forgive my less-than-cordial welcome. May the rest of your stay with us be a pleasant one.

**000:** Come with me. I will answer whatever questions you have when we are somewhere more private. Right, then. Before we plunge into the wheres and wherefores, let me first thank you for answering my summons. I had intended to bring you directly to my personal quarters, but I fear my aim was...slightly off. That you were still able to make the crossing unharmed is...a great relief. And so we come to the question of where. The realm in which you now find yourself belongs to one of the thirteen reflections or shards─the First, to be precise─even if its inhabitants are largely oblivious to the fact. As to wherefore... Having been awarded the rather grandiose title of “Crystal Exarch,” I─in my capacity as caretaker of the Crystarium─thought to seek the aid of you and your companions.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you ask? Are the other Scions here? Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Ah. That...is a question with no simple answer. But all shall be explained in due course, I promise you. ...An inkling, yes. I can only beg your forgiveness─matters here forced my hand. But all shall be explained in due course, I promise you. Let us begin with the glaring skies up above. Here in the First, the world has been all but consumed by primordial Light. It began a century ago, by this realm's reckoning. A luminous flood swallowing everything in its path. More than nine-tenths of this star was lost. And the fortunate few who survived are hounded by abominations born of that catastrophe even now. "Sin eaters,“ we call them. The creature you saw earlier was one such monstrosity. It was to save the First from this menace that I learned to bridge the rift between worlds─that I might call upon the aid of the greatest of heroes. Though it meant depriving a world of its champion, I had to try─for in saving the First, you would bring salvation to the Source as well. But what manner of host harangues his guest in the middle of the road? Let us continue our talk within the Crystarium.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Such a proud and vibrant city... The sole sanctuary for the living in a world all but resigned to oblivion. Each stone was laid with hope; the town itself a symbol, a monument to defiance in the face of death. No would-be hero could fail to answer its call. For who among us does not yearn for salvation?

**000:** Welcome to the Ocular, my private study. We can speak here without fear of being overheard. I have much to explain, but the truths which I must touch upon in doing so would cause only distress and confusion to the people of this world. Pray keep that in mind. Now, I am sure you are desperate to know the fate of your fellow Scions. To put it simply, they are here in the First... Their arrival, however, was not as recent as you may imagine. Here, time flows at a different pace from that of the Source. In the space of a single hour in your home world, an entire year might pass in the First─and the reverse could also be true. The pace fluctuates without rhyme or reason, and it cannot be predicted. That said, we seem to be entering a period of near-equivalence, and thus, for the moment, you need not overly concern yourself with the passage of time. As for your companions, however... Y'shtola and Urianger have dwelled here for three winters all told, while Thancred's count stands at five. Even our more “recent” arrivals, Alphinaud and Alisaie, have lived in the First for almost a year. My intention had been to summon only you, but the art of reaching across worlds has proven exceedingly difficult to master. Thus it was that my *fumbling* hand closed upon those to whom your fate is most closely bound as well. As they were not the object of my summons...their transference was...incomplete. Though they may appear to possess corporeal bodies, they are, in truth, merely spirits that one can see and touch. Consequently, while you yourself will be able to pass between worlds with relative freedom, they will not. Much as it grieves me...they are stranded here, unable to return.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Then find a way to send them back. What have they been doing all this time?

**000:** We spent every waking hour searching for a way to reverse the summoning. In the beginning, at least... As you may have surmised, however, our efforts met with little success. And then we all but abandoned the endeavor once Urianger shared with us the vision he had witnessed during his journey through the rift. In that chaotic no-man's-land between realms, time and space warp and blend in...unexpected ways. What Urianger saw...was the future. That which would one day come to pass. In his vision of tomorrow, the First was rejoined with the Source... This collision of worlds brought about the Eighth Umbral Calamity, and the deaths of countless multitudes. Amongst those who perished, Urianger clearly saw the fall of the Scions' mightiest champion. He watched you die. And thus did the Scions embrace their exile, and began searching this world for a means to forestall the coming catastrophe in yours. Their souls are stranded in the First, yes, but they have fought on, desperate to save their home─and you─from destruction. Nor have their efforts been in vain: for it was they who finally established that the elimination of the sin eaters will indeed serve to prevent the calamity. Considering the...circumstances of our meeting, you would be forgiven for doubting my version of events. And so, before all else, I would suggest you track down your comrades, and hear the tale from their lips. I shall, of course, be happy to assist in these reunions─and you need not make any decisions regarding your involvement until you are certain of where you stand. Meanwhile, I promise I will not rest until I have found a way to help your friends return home. What say you? Have I earned your trust for the moment, at least?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? For the moment. Aye, but I'll see you keep that promise. For want of a better choice...

**FEOUL:** Excellent. You will not regret this. With that settled, we shall have to see about getting you ready for the road. Traveling across the rift has no doubt left you weary─I will arrange for a room where you might rest in comfort. While it's being prepared, perhaps I can show you around? This is the Musica Universalis, the commercial heart of the Crystarium. Aught you might need to prepare for your journeys can be purchased here. Ah, yes─you must be curious about the currency. Fear not! The gil you carry will serve you well enough. Each nation once minted its own coins, but 'twas all a jumbled mess following the Flood. After much debate, the local merchants eventually elected to revert to the old ways, wherein a coin's value was decided by the worth of its metal. As for a unit of measurement, we agreed upon the term “gil.” A word borrowed from coins uncovered within the Crystal Tower here. And as our traders peddled their wares across the land, so too did our usage of gil become common practice. From what Y'shtola tells me, a standard coin from the Source equates to exactly one gil here─or near enough not to matter. Our way of life has benefited greatly from the artifacts we recovered from the tower... ...Some of which may be familiar to you. But I fear it would not be practical for us to provide *everything* to which you are accustomed. You shall need a means to access the commodities of your home world... [Are you there, my friend?]

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-???-)Yes, I'm here, of course I'm here! What amusements do you have for me today?

**FEOUL:** My dear Feo Ul, paragon of pixie-kind. For you, I have the most vital task. This fine gentleman is a friend from a distant realm. This fine lady is a friend from a distant realm. And we have need of a means to ferry things back and forth from her home. Might you be able to...assist us in this matter?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** You came from beyond, didn't you!? From beyond the rift! How wonderfully exciting! What a brave and reckless and marvelous thing you did! You've the heart of a pixie, you do! After careful consideration, I have decided to grant you my assistance. Make a pact with me, and the fun can begin! But answer me this, traveler: did your garments come with you when you crossed over? Your teeth? Your nails? Just as I thought! Then you've a good, stout connection with your home, through which all your belongings great and small may easily pass. From this moment forth, I will be your [beautiful branch], and you my [adorable sapling]. Like the branch which sprouts from the sapling, our bond will flow unbroken from one to the other! Raise your hand. 'Tis done! We are bound now, dearest sapling. Come, come, then! Make your request! Tell me your desire! I wish to visit this world of yours!

**000:** Mayhap a message to your friends in the Source to inform them of your safe arrival?

**FEOUL:** Who will you contact? Send a message to Tataru. Send a message to Krile.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Consider it done!

**SYSTEM:** As you heard, that was Feo Ul of the pixies. Their kind possess an affinity for magic akin to that of arcane beings. They rarely show themselves in populated areas, but Feo is insatiably curious even by pixie standards, and seems to have taken a liking to the Crystarium. Right, we were going to organize a room for you, weren't we? Come along.

**000:** (-???-)...You...? (-???-)I know you... You're the Warrior of Light from the Source!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? The Warrior of Darkness...? And who are you?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-???-)What? Did you just... You can hear me!? (-???-)Oh, gods, how long has it been...? (-???-)...Aye...aye, that was what I called myself in your world... The “Warrior of Darkness.” My real name is Ardbert. I used an alias in the Source. A daft one, looking back... (-???-)...“And who are you?” she says. An enemy not worth remembering, apparently... My name is Ardbert. In the First, I was a Warrior of Light, but in the Source you knew me as the Warrior of Darkness. If you recall my tale, it was my comrades and I who caused the Flood. We thought our home doomed. And so we listened to the Ascians─let them guide us to the Source, and tried to hasten their godsdamned Ardor. I remember when we fell, defeated by you and yours. I remember our audience with Minfilia─how she listened to our pleas, and returned our souls to the First. The Flood was poised to swallow Norvrandt... Minfilia and my friends, they...they surrendered what little they had left to hold it back. Just faded away...leaving me to bear witness. Tell me, do you know the year? How much time has passed since we caused the Flood? A hundred years... A hundred long years... My hands find no purchase. My gestures catch no eye. And my pleas, be they whispered or screamed, reach not a single ear... I am a shade, cursed to do naught but drift. I feel as if I've been walking forever... I hardly noticed when my mind and body began to fray at the edges. Then “bang,” my senses were sharp again. I felt like a fish being reeled in, and before I knew it, I found myself in this room. Why is it that *you* can see me? What are you even doing here, come to that? You were summoned to save the First? A waste of time. This world is beyond saving─like those who try to save it. Muddled as my mind may be, I've not forgotten that. But if fate has brought me to you─the one person in this godsforsaken world who can see and hear me─then perhaps there is a reason I endured. If I can find out why I was left behind, then maybe...maybe I can bring this journey of mine to an end... Well. I'll be watching, Warrior of Light. But do me a favor. Be careful out there. This world has had its fill of heroes.

**000:** Ah, how did you find your new quarters? I trust you were able to rest?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Well enough, thank you. I had a ghostly visitor...

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** That is good to hear. Should you want for anything, pray let me know. I...was not aware the room was haunted. And...you *were* rather tired... Well, should you receive another visitation, be sure to let me know. Now, let us return to the subject of the Scions' whereabouts. This map shows the lands of Norvrandt, the only area to be spared the Flood of Light. The Crystarium is here, in the region known as Lakeland. To the north is the faerie kingdom of Il Mheg. That is where you will find Urianger. To the east lies the once-prosperous civilization of Rak'tika. Y'shtola is stationed there, in the heart of the forest. Alas, neither location can be reached without considerable difficulty. As such, I would suggest you first seek out one of the twins─each of whom is stationed but a short flight from the Crystarium. Alphinaud is on Kholusia, an island off the western shore. It is home to a city called Eulmore, where the rich and privileged while away their days in idleness. For his part in furthering our cause, Alphinaud journeyed there to meet with the citizenry and forge alliances. From what I hear, he has since kept himself busy gathering information around the main settlement. Alisaie, meanwhile, traveled south to the arid wastes of Amh Araeng. They lie upon the very edge of the inhabitable world, where the Flood of Light was halted. Those who dwell there live in constant fear of attack by the sin eaters. In contrast to her brother, Alisaie felt that her energies would better be spent learning about the enemy. And thus she sells her services as a guard, both to hone her skills and gather information on our foe. So, will it be Kholusia or Amh Araeng? It matters not which you choose to visit first. Simply inform me once you have made your decision, and I will see to it that you are provided with a suitable mount. Ah, but you must be wondering about Thancred. He has taken up with...a new companion, and is presently engaged as a wandering hunter of sin eaters. Being ever on the move, his whereabouts are often difficult to ascertain, but I am certain your paths will cross ere long.

**ALPHINAUD:** The whistling breeze, mute. The pounding surf, frozen. Time itself takes a breath... At Light's edge, all is perfectly still. The world captured in a painting; locked in a moment. Music, faint and fleeting, drifts coastward on the lifeless air... And in the distance, beyond the broken earth, a city beckons...

**THEVA:** (-???-)And how is business today, Mistress Theva?

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, frenetic. Look. I have a new customer.

**THEVA:** ...'Tis good to see you, my friend. The barley seeds you wanted. They should produce a better harvest than the last.

**ALPHINAUD:** What, just like that? Oh, Alphinaud, you really are a dear. Well, I'd best be tidying up some of those empty shacks before the pests move in. Keep an eye on the place while I'm out, eh?

**000:** It seems an age since last we spoke. Not since the prisoner exchange in Doma. And Yotsuyu... It has been even longer for me, of course, if you count the days I have spent here. But the time has only added to the relief I feel, seeing you safe and well.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Me? I was more worried about you. We thought we'd lost you.

**GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE:** Hah! Alisaie said much the same thing. I don't think I've ever had such a scolding. But I believe an exchange of news is in order. Come─tell me of your arrival, and all that came before! I see. Both the Exarch and Alisaie told me what they knew of events, but I had stubbornly clung on to the hope that all-out war might yet be avoidable... And poor Tataru─she must be sick with worry. We must endeavor to return as soon as we may...  'Twould be nice to bring her good tidings for a change. But before we bid this world farewell, we must first ensure that it is not rejoined to the Source. We must prevent the Eighth Umbral Calamity. Urianger's vision of the future has, I fear, every chance of coming true. By his description, the catalyst for the Calamity was a formless and deadly weapon employed by the Garlean Empire. Which can only mean one thing: Black Rose. Gaius was telling you the truth. When we were on the trail of the Ascians, we saw evidence that the gas was being manufactured once more. Gaius was adamant that the project had been scrapped. But so long as there are wars to be waged, there will always be those determined to win by any means. And thus simply destroying the existing stores of Black Rose would do little to alter fate's course. In that sense, our involuntary journey here to the First was something of a boon. Together with the Exarch, we've developed a theory as to how we believe the Rejoining will be set in motion. I am sure Urianger himself will cover the subject in more detail... But I can tell you the process requires that both worlds─the Source and the First─be facing an existential threat. One being sin eaters, of course. They are a menace that I would dearly love to remove, and not just to avert a calamity. I may be a stranger to this world, but I will not stand idly by and let innocent people be slaughtered. That is what brought me to the gates of Eulmore. Ignoring its pretentions as a kind of capital city to what remains of the world, it is nonetheless a center of power and authority. If any solutions are to be found, I believe our search should begin there. What say you, old friend? Hungry for another adventure? And so we take to the road once more! That gate up ahead is known as the “Open Arms,” and Eulmore itself lies beyond. This, meanwhile, is the aptly named “Gatetown.” The dwelling place of the many desperate souls who hope to be chosen to live in the city proper.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh! I thought I recognized you. Brought a new friend, eh? Heh heh heh heh... I'll bet you've got a trick or two up your sleeve. Maybe even *three*! Care to show me?

**GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE:** He's not here to compete. Leave him be. She's not here to compete. Leave her be.

**CLOWNOFBLUE:** What!? I was only making conversation!

**CLOWNOFRED:** (-???-)Ladies and gentlemen! Your attention pleeease!

**CLOWNOFBLUE:** Greetings to our hopeful petitioners, one and all! Eulmore extends its warmest regards! Let it be known that a lady of distinction wishes to dine on fish divine!

**CLOWNOFRED:** We seek a master culinarian who can guarantee seafood perfection! Dazzle the matron with your delicious dishes, and life in the city will be yours to enjoy. Even on days when fish is not on the menu!

**GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE:** Who among you will answer the call? Name yourself or another, we mind not at all!

**GATETOWNMAN:** Fish, is it?

**GATETOWNWOMAN:** Was there anyone?

**ALPHINAUD:** What about that girl?

**CLOWNOFRED:** Do you recall how I said Eulmore was a center of power and authority? Well, that is not the only reason for its fame. It is also known as the “city of final pleasures.” The noble and the wealthy who survived the Flood gathered here to live out the rest of their days in decadent abandon. A poor man could sooner pass through the eye of a needle than Eulmore's gates. The only way the commonfolk can enter this perverted paradise is if they fulfill the whim of one of the privileged. And so they are picked over like market produce...

**CLOWNOFBLUE:** Ohoho! What a catch! We'll not be throwing this one back! Having seen your all-too-obvious charms, we welcome you with open arms! Come, join us in the city of splendor, and live out your life in an ecstasy of endeavor!

**CLOWNOFRED:** Ah, just look at those expectant faces! What could you *possibly* be waiting for!? Well, well, what have we here!? An extra share of meol to celebrate our newest resident!

**CLOWNOFBLUE:** For you!

**GATETOWNMIDDLEAGE:** Enjoy!

**GATETOWNMAN:** Ah, at last!

**GATETOWNWOMAN:** Thank goodness.

**ALPHINAUD:** Over here!

**KAISHIRR:** “Meol” is a foodstuff which Eulmore routinely doles out to the people of Gatetown, and apparently a staple for its citizens as well. Many here rely on it to survive in these times of scarcity. Yet the whole arrangement just seems... Well, let us just say it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. There you are! The thief who claimed the harvest on *my* behalf. Hand it over.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Blue-haired Mystel-)Wha─ I...I... (-Blue-haired Mystel-)Forgive me, I just─ I have to get into the city! (-Blue-haired Mystel-)I have no family, and all my friends have already been chosen. (-Blue-haired Mystel-)No one here gives a damn about me. When the meol gets handed out, I'm lucky if I get a smell of it! (-Blue-haired Mystel-)No matter what I do, they won't call out my name! I'm so tired─I'm so *bloody* hungry... (-Blue-haired Mystel-)I thought maybe I could steal your idea─get in that way...

**KAISHIRR:** ...What is your name?

**ALPHINAUD:** Kai-Shirr...

**KAISHIRR:** Tell me then, Kai-Shirr─must it be Eulmore or nothing? What of the Crystarium? They may not offer charity, but you would be fairly compensated for any work you did.

**ALPHINAUD:** No, no, it has to be Eulmore! That's where all my friends are. We made a promise that we'd live together in paradise...

**KAISHIRR:** ...I was to make my deal with the Ondo at the Clave. Listen carefully, and I shall tell you my plans for the business, and how best to arouse the Eulmorans' interest.

**ALPHINAUD:** You'll give me your place? Just like that?

**KAISHIRR:** I'm giving you a chance, nothing more. What comes of it is entirely up to you.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...I understand! Oh thank you, thank you!

**000:** This was but one path─there will be others. But for young Kai-Shirr, it was the difference between life and death. I do not regret my decision...yet I will admit that a part of me wonders if it was for the best. We strive to bring swift salvation to this world, that countless lives might be saved─not least your own. Even if it came at the cost of one man, should I have forged on regardless...?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? That's not who you are. Quite possibly. Meaning we'd better hurry up and think of a new plan.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** I suppose not... Were Estinien here, he would most likely scoff at my soft-heartedness. “Same old Alphinaud. Ever the slave to sentiment.” But I thank you for your kind words, nonetheless. Let us see to it that both these stories have a happy ending. Indeed. We will find another way, I promise you. Shall we return to Wright, then? Is that...? I can't be sure, but I-I think someone's in trouble! Come on, they may need our help!

**DULIACHAI:** Redemption is beyond us. The lament of all but saints and fools...and the comfort of the lords and ladies of this accursed place. Once, they held fast against the madness, only to embrace the coming cataclysm and delight in the end of days. Perhaps in rapture they seek to lose themselves and the misery they share... Or perhaps for them alone the promise of eternal pleasure really does hold true.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ooh? Who's this then?

**CHAINUZZ:** Lord and Lady Chai, pray forgive our intrusion. I am given to understand you were in search...of an *artist*?

**DULIACHAI:** Ahh, you must be the new, uh...

**CHAINUZZ:** Oh, goodness me! What an adorable boy! That silken hair, those pearly cheeks...oh, and you even smell wonderful─like a bed of flowers! I approve of this one, dearest! I am *positive* he will paint us the most delightful pictures.

**DULIACHAI:** I, um, er, y-yes... Ahem. Well, as long as he paints better than that talentless wretch we sent packing last week...

**ALPHINAUD:** Wonderful, wonderful! Welcome to Eulmore...um, er...

**CHAINUZZ:** Alphinaud, if it please you, my lady. And this...is my assistant.

**ALPHINAUD:** Your...assistant? I've heard of folk bringing in family members, but this seems a bit irregular. Aren't you a little young to have a protégé?

**DULIACHAI:** We are family in all but name, my lord. Though we share no blood, we have stood by each other through life's many challenges, resolved to prevail together─or not at all. Of all people, 'tis he who best understands my work. With his unique insight guiding my hand, the art I create is sure to satisfy your expectations. Of all people, 'tis she who best understands my work. With her unique insight guiding my hand, the art I create is sure to satisfy your expectations. Once the picture is begun, of course, I shall have no need of constant encouragement. And so I wondered, rather than her being in your way, might it then be permissible for my assistant to explore the city she has so longed to see? Out of gratitude for her *priceless* contribution to my art, I thought it only fair that I make this humble request on her behalf.

**CHAINUZZ:** Oooh, did you ever hear of such devotion! Of *course* your assistant must have her wish! She shall be free to roam to her heart's content! ...Isn't that right, darling?

**ALPHINAUD:** Uh... Oh, yes. Yes, of course, dearest. Q-Quite right.

**KAISHIRR:** That's him. That's Vauthry! He is attended by sin eaters...? But how does he keep them from attacking?

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Mercy... Mercy...

**VAUTHRY:** By the Twelve! Kai-Shirr! What happened to you!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Who are these impudent louts? I do not recall requesting their presence.

**VAUTHRY:** Lord Vauthry! What is the meaning of this? Why is this poor man bleeding to death on your floor!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Why? You ask me why? Because criminals must be punished, and this man is guilty of fraud. He came to us claiming to be a man of business, yet his subsequent conduct has shown him to be anything but! Eulmore is a city built on love for one's fellow man. Those who have naught to give and live only to take are a blight upon our society! To atone for this crime, I ordered that he fling himself from the balcony. And he had the *temerity* to weep! “Please, my lord! Anything but that!” What then is a man of mercy to do, but offer the sinner another way to show his contrition?

**VAUTHRY:** "Another way“ meaning what, exactly!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Sin eaters are part of Eulmore's society. But they must be fed with aether─*living* aether. So─I demanded an offering of flesh! Carved by his own hand, from his own hide! And still! *Still*, he could not do as I asked! A wholly unsatisfactory performance!

**VAUTHRY:** 'Tis true that Kai-Shirr won his place here by fraud. But his actions were driven only by a desire to share in your paradise. That you would cast him out I could almost accept, but to humiliate him thus? To demand his very *life*!? Is this truly the way of Eulmore!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, you dim, deluded child... Have you ever paused to consider what it takes to maintain such a paradise in this barren, broken world of ours? The guarantee of safety and stability. The knowledge that if one only abides by the rules, one has naught to fear. I alone can offer these things, for I alone can command the sin eaters. And thus am I alone the voice of justice─and any who oppose me villains to be punished!

**VAUTHRY:** And people call this paradise...

**ALPHINAUD:** *You* were granted a place in my city for a particular skill. What was it?

**VAUTHRY:** ...Painting.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oho, an artiste! Then you shall paint a picture for me. Of Eulmore. If I find your art *pleasing*, then I may excuse this display of insolence. Who gave you permission to tend to that criminal's wounds!? I told you to paint me a picture!

**KAISHIRR:** What you need is a mirror, not a painting. It will capture the horror I see before me far better than I ever could. Can you walk?

**VAUTHRY:** I think so...

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Did...did that little worm just insult me? (TWO LONG SCREAMS) I─I─I'll kill them! I'll─I'll kill them all! I'll enslave their minds! I'll─I'll torment them─torture them! Then tear out their hearts!

**000:** Amh Araeng. From this parched earth the nation of Nabaath Areng once rose. When I journeyed here, long ago, I spoke with a sun-weathered elder. He told me Amh Araeng meant “majestic land” in the language of his people. And so it might still be...were it not for the Light's unrelenting onslaught...

**CASSARD:** What will you say? So this is a Mord...? That's a kobold! What beady eyes...

**GHENGEN:** Master Ghen Gen, this is the friend of the Exarch I was telling you about.

**CASSARD:** Very good, very good! Though friend or no, all are welcome in Mord Souq.

**GHENGEN:** "Souq“ is Mordish for ”city.“ As things stand, this souq boasts the largest and busiest marketplace in all Amh Araeng. You'll find ore from the mines here, of course, but all manner of other things too─many of them rare. As I told you before, not many visit Amh Araeng by choice, but Mord Souq's a different story. Merchants come from malms around to purchase the relics the Mord dig up.

**CASSARD:** Aye, that they do, for Mord do not dismiss the spoils of the earth. We clean them and polish them and reveal to the world their true value! That is why they come here! Come from far away! Come with much money! And so our souq is always busy, busy, busy! No such thing as a thing no one needs!

**GHENGEN:** You say that every time, Master Ghen Gen! Some sort of family motto, wasn't it? Or perhaps a Mord philosophy─for which we should all be very grateful. Would that everyone was so willing to take in refugees regardless of race or creed. Now, then─if you intend to spend any time here, you'll want to gain the trust of the locals. And there's a little custom all newcomers are expected to observe...

**CASSARD:** The cracking of the coinpurse! You buy one thing from the market. Price can be low or high, just as long as you buy!

**MORDMERCHANTA:** ...As the good Mord says. In fact, the Exarch sent a little something to cover this very expense. A Voeburt gold piece, no less! The first I've held in years.

**MORDMERCHANTB:** Voeburt gold!? *Real* Voeburt gold!?

**MORDMERCHANTC:** Here, newcomer! Crack your coinpurse with me!

**MORDMERCHANTA:** No, no, you want my goods, newcomer! I have jars and pots, all smooth and shiny!

**MORDMERCHANTB:** Over here!

**MORDMERCHANTC:** Come and look!

**GHENGEN:** You buy! You buy!

**ALISAIE:** Enough of that! Calm, I say! This one must still journey through the barrens. Nothing bulky! Nothing heavy! No *pots*! Nothing better for the road than a full belly. Spend that piece at Rhon Ron's place, yes? Eat for three before you leave!

**000:** (-???-)Get back here! Is that!? It can't be... Hah!

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? Impressive! You almost lost that one.

**TESLEEN:** Just a lesser sin eater. Nothing to write home about. I had it under control! ...Right up until the moment I didn't. I'll do better next time. I knew you'd turn up sooner or later, but I had been hoping for *sooner*. How are you? We've fought them to a standstill, then... The Exarch did say that the Empire seemed to have drawn back when he last looked in on the Source. But without knowing for sure how fast time was passing there, I couldn't help worrying that a lot might have happened since then. I'm heartily relieved to hear that it hasn't─just as Alphinaud must have been. As you can imagine, both he and Urianger were desperate to hear the news from home when I arrived. I haven't actually seen Thancred and Y'shtola yet, but they will have heard all the latest developments from the Exarch by now─or should have, at least. When I think of how frantic Tataru and the others must be, I want nothing more than to rush back and reassure them... But we still haven't found a way to reverse the summoning. And even if we had, we couldn't just ignore Urianger's vision. He may use ten words where one would suffice─and they may often obscure as much as they reveal... But on this matter, he was as clear as day. I do not doubt for one moment that he saw what he claims. Nor how difficult it must have been to speak about them. The Eighth Umbral Calamity and your death aren't exactly topics for idle conversation. As much as I might want to go home, I don't want to go home to that. We can't allow the Rejoining to happen, which means we have to save the First from the sin eaters. That great wall of white is a remnant of the Flood. A hundred years ago, the balance in the First tipped decisively in favor of Light. From that moment, it rose and swelled with each passing day─and then, without warning, it burst forth like water from a broken dam. ...A colossal wave of pure Light, drowning everything in its wake. Only Norvrandt was spared. For the most part, living things are composed of aether of various different aspects. But when exposed to such a flood, their aetheric harmony is shattered, and their natural form breaks down. Then they either perish...or are warped into mindless abominations. Yes, that's how the sin eaters came to be. They were once living creatures─or people─that were caught in the path of the Flood. Once the change is wrought, there is no going back. In that instant, they are gripped by an insatiable appetite for aether, and will happily gorge themselves on any living thing within reach. But even that is not the worst of it. The stronger sin eaters can plant Light in us like seeds in soil, corrupting our aether, and triggering the birth of new monstrosities. They are creatures of base instinct that exist only to feed and to multiply. They feel no pity, know no remorse, and are utterly deaf to reason. Which is why they must be destroyed. Every last one of them. The infirmary is full of the sin eaters' victims, left here to spend their final hours waiting for the change to overtake them... Look, over there─where the wall is broken. Do you see what lies beyond? That's what the land became after the Light flooded in. An empty white nothingness. Life cannot exist in such conditions. The primordial Light would wreak havoc on the body's aetheric balance. That nectarine you bought...it's Halric's favorite fruit. Most of the patients, Halric included, survived the attacks of powerful eaters. But their fate was sealed all the same. The monsters' corruption has entered their bodies, and their very essence is being subsumed by Light. The twisted state of the world itself just makes matters worse. Under normal circumstances, a person's aether naturally tends to equilibrium, but for these poor souls, the opposite is true. Sooner or later, every single one of them will turn. Tesleen and the patients, they all know this. They know what has to be done before the change goes too far─before the eater within takes over. The preferred method is mixing poison into their favorite food. In my time here, I've borne witness to a lot of last meals. I feel just as helpless as before. No matter how hard I fight, it's never enough. But it's a war I mean to wage, nonetheless. ...Speaking of wars, do you remember how I made you promise not to leave me, and then promptly collapsed? Well, let's just say I had a few choice words for the Exarch concerning the timing of his summons... But even if the fault lay with someone else, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd abandoned you on the battlefield. So I swore that I'd make up for my absence there by making a difference here. And that's what keeps me moving forward...even when things seem hopeless. On which note, it's time we headed back. The longer we keep Tesleen waiting, the harder this will be for her...

**ALISAIE:** Speak up if you'd like another helping. I made a little bit more than usual today.

**TESLEEN:** And you've added something special to the broth, if I'm not mistaken?

**000:** Aye, well, it's not often we have visitors from the Crystarium, so I may have thrown in a few extra bits and bobs.

**TESLEEN:** What will you say? You needn't have gone to the trouble. I'll have another bowl, then!

**ALISAIE:** Oh, it's nothing, really! And we do so rarely have guests. That's what I like to hear! Give me a moment to warm up the pot. In a place like this, you learn to take what moments of happiness you can get. I remember when I first came here with my mother. She was showing the early signs... I knew there was no way to save her, but I just couldn't face what needed to be done. That's the way of it for most people─why they travel for malms to stay here. Beaten, broken souls come to wait out the inevitable. To receive the mercy of a painless death. When my mother finally left this world, I was mad with grief, but also thankful that her passing was a peaceful one. It's never easy, ending a life you've cared for. Even when you believe they go on to a better place. I often find myself wishing the Warrior of Darkness would come and do that part for me.

**TESLEEN:** The Warrior of Darkness...?

**ALISAIE:** You've never heard the tale? I'm not sure where it began, but every child in Norvrandt could tell you a version of it. "Warrior of Darkness, servant of death,
take care of our souls at our dying breath... “Let sinners and eaters of sin go with thee,
That all may return to the sunless sea.” ...Well, that's the version I was taught anyway. It's just an old bedtime story─he's certainly never deigned to visit us here.

**TESLEEN:** Which is a good thing, surely? He sounds rather ominous.

**JOURNEYSHEADPATIENT:** Do you think so? I always liked the idea that he treated every soul the same, even the sin eaters.

**JOURNEYSHEADNURSE:** They're coming...

**ALISAIE:** Tesleen! Have you seen Halric!? I swear, I only took my eyes off him for a moment...

**TESLEEN:** Any sign of him!? No luck, then. But he surely can't have gone far. We should keep looking. The sin eaters are out in force, and if we don't find him soon, you can be sure they will. Did you see the size of that thing? It must be one of the nasty ones. Wherever it's going, it can only mean trouble. After it! There it is! Is that─ Oh...oh no! Halric!

**ALISAIE:** We have to run!

**TESLEEN:** Tesleen, no!

**ALISAIE:** We all deserve happiness...wherever we can find it... The time left to you...is precious... No one should die...in pain... Mother...Mother, I... (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING)

**TESLEEN:** Oh no, no... No, no, no, no, no!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Forgive me...Alisaie...

**ALISAIE:** And so you return. Have you gained a better understanding of the crisis now faced by the First?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** "Better“ is not the word I would use. Some lands may have been spared the Flood, but the survivors live only to suffer. There seems no end to the horrors inflicted by the sin eaters.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. Those abominations are a calamity in their own right. And I can well imagine how hopeless the task of eradicating them must seem to you. But after countless battles and untold sacrifice, we have identified a potential weakness. Sin eaters are drawn to serve the strongest of their kind─a class of creature we call “Lightwardens.” And from what we have been able to ascertain, only a handful of these entities exist. Just as an ant colony will perish in the absence of its queen, we believe that the death of a Lightwarden will cause the lesser creatures within its sphere of influence to disperse.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I have a feeling Eulmore might have something to say about any concerted action we take against these monsters. Vauthry's command over the sin eaters is integral to Eulmoran society. In seeming to guarantee his people's safety, it guarantees their obedience. He will not take kindly to us depriving him of such useful allies.

**000:** Agreed. Thus we will need to occupy or otherwise divert his forces whilst we proceed with the business of eliminating the Wardens. Until we have done so, all other considerations must be set aside if we are to forestall the Eighth Umbral Calamity.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Are you sure that eliminating the Wardens will be enough? I'm not sure I follow...

**ALISAIE:** Your uncertainty is understandable, given the circumstances. Perhaps a more detailed explanation is in order. To begin at the beginning, then... In the ancient past, a single star was divided into fourteen worlds. This is the Source─your home. These others are the thirteen shards, in whose number we find the First. Though physically separate, they retain a connection to each other, and with the Source especially. Now, let us assume that a given element in one of the shards attains abnormal ascendancy. Just as water will flow from the highest point to the lowest, the excess energy will begin trickling into the Source... And such an influx of aether will of course exert a palpable influence. If the element in question were fire, then drought and wild fires might ensue. If it were ice, one might expect the weather to turn bitterly cold. As aether continues to pour in, such phenomena will become more and more extreme, until eventually, a single untimely event triggers a disaster which “cracks” the barrier dividing the two worlds. What was once a trickle now becomes a deluge, sweeping the shard along to be rejoined with the Source. At the same time, the element which held sway in the shard is unleashed in full, its energies amplifying the original disaster to truly catastrophic proportions. An earthquake thus magnified might strike with enough force to shatter continents; a tidal wave might swell to a size capable of drowning entire nations. These devastating events are what we refer to as “Umbral Calamities.” Seven times has a calamity befallen the Source; seven times has a shard been absorbed. At present, the Light-drowned realm of the First stands perilously close to meeting the conditions for a Rejoining. It is the sin eaters who are to blame for the Light's continued dominance. In addition to attracting their lesser kin, the Lightwardens I mentioned earlier radiate aether, saturating every corner of their territory with Light. Even here in the Flood-spared region of Norvrandt, their influence is strong enough to banish night from the sky. Thus, if we are to restore balance to the First and head off a potential calamity, it is imperative that we put each and every Lightwarden to the sword.

**ALPHINAUD:** We've been doing our best to take the fight to the enemy ever since we first heard the Exarch's explanation.

**LYNA:** Though we have yet to claim any meaningful victories, if truth be told. Apart from being confoundingly elusive, the Lightwardens possess a troublesome quality which compelled us to delay our plans until such time as you arrived.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Forgive the interruption, my lord, but Holminster Switch is requesting reinforcements! They say the sin eaters are attacking in force, and the village could soon be overrun.

**LYNA:** Alert the guard. We should be prepared in case the fighting reaches the Crystarium. You have command of our forces in the field, Captain, but hold off on entering the town until I arrive. That goes for Alphinaud and Alisaie as well.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** My lord!

**LYNA:** Pray, lend us your strength. Such a fight will provide you with far greater insight than any explanation I could offer.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** It's releasing its aether. Fall back! We cannot let it touch us. Quickly, my lord, we must withdraw!

**CRYSTARIUMMAN:** That will not be necessary, Captain. ...Though I appreciate your concern. The eternal Light of these creatures has confounded us for nigh on a hundred years. For each we have put down, another has risen up in its place, born of the selfsame aether relinquished by its predecessor. But now we have a way to contain that corruption. The blessing of Light! And the hero who wields it now stands before you! The blessing of Light! And the hero who wields it now stands before you! Behold! The monster's power is broken! And the world twisted by its touch returns to its rightful form!

**CRYSTARIUMWOMAN:** The sky!

**CRYSTARIUMOLDMAN:** It can't be...

**CRYSTARIUMGIRL:** What's happening...?

**MOREN:** It's so beautiful...

**LYNA:** The sunless sea... The Warrior of Darkness has come!

**ALPHINAUD:** Is that...what I think it is?

**LYNA:** The night sky, as it should be.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Who *are* you people? You killed a Warden, then bathed in its aether as if it were a spring shower, and now the sky...? The legends are true! My lord...?

**000:** How many years have I waited for this moment... For the one possessed of Her blessing. For you. You have vanquished the Lightwarden of Lakeland, and for the first time in a century darkness has returned to the mantle of night. Without the ever-present Light to sustain them, the sin eaters will have no choice but to retreat. ...Yet our victory is far from complete. Though darkness has fallen here, the other Wardens yet bask beneath burning skies, feasting upon what little life remains. Even should it cost me all I have, I would see each and every one of them slain, that this world might be spared from oblivion! Not only for the First, but for the Source as well! Save one and we save the other! But...be that as it may...I concede it was wrong of me to summon you to this fight against your will. I swear on my life, I will one day atone for that deed. But for the present... I beg you stay and see this fight to its conclusion. Cast down the Wardens, and restore Darkness to the First!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? I will become the Warrior you need. It sounds like a glorious adventure! It seems I've no choice but to fight.

**ALISAIE:** On behalf of the First, I offer you my deepest thanks.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I understand there is much at stake here, Exarch, but why do you risk yourself so readily? It must have been a dangerous drain on your aether to summon even one person across the rift.

**ALISAIE:** I do it for my people, of course─to give the Crystarium the tomorrow it deserves.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** That is true *now*, yes─but the city had yet to be built when you first called forth the Crystal Tower. I'm simply curious to know what prompted you to commit yourself so completely to this particular course.

**ALISAIE:** There are...things which we can ill afford to lose. And...I sensed from the first that I had a part to play in preserving them. Forgive me. I fear the events of the day may have taken their toll. Despite appearances, I am an old man─one burdened with many...difficult memories, some too painful to recall.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, then I'm sorry for pressing you. It's a family failing, I'm afraid.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Hmph. One which has served us well, more often than not. Needless to say, we will continue to fight at your side until the last sin eater is defeated.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Come then, my Warriors of Darkness─let us gather the surviving villagers, and make our way back to the Crystarium.

**000:** So it's your lot's turn to be the Warriors of Darkness, is it? It's funny how things work out.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? Been watching, have you? These are my “private” quarters...

**RYNE:** Well, I did warn you. I followed you to Eulmore and then on to Amh Araeng. And I was there when you slew the Lightwarden. Aye, I know. Just the place. In case you've forgotten, you're the only one who can see me. If we had one of our little chats in public, people might start thinking you'd lost your wits. Those white-haired twins who were with you... I remember them from our battle in the Source. Are they your friends, then? Through thick and thin? Aye... Then I suggest you keep them close. It's when you charge ahead trying to save someone else that you end up losing those you love. Not that you need telling. I'll bet you've lost plenty. But I wonder...what will it cost you this time? I don't remember when it was that I learned regret wasn't worth the bother. You get numb to it all over the years. The lost comrades, the broken promises, the abandoned principles─just more nagging burdens to ignore.

**SYSTEM:** (-???-)So this is what the Light was hiding...  (-???-)She's here. I must go to her.

**GARLEANGENERAL:** Meanwhile, inside an imperial magitek facility in the Source...

**ESTINIEN:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)Intruders! Fan out and find them!

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Out of my way!

**ESTINIEN:** (-???-)Stay your weapon. We are not your enemy. When the alarum sounded, I wondered what we had done to betray our presence. But I see now we were not the only intruders. Ser Estinien, I presume─the dragoon who plucked the Warrior of Light from the jaws of death. Your armor is most distinct.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Much as yours once was. But even without it, I see a former legatus still has eyes and ears in unexpected places. "Van“ Baelsar, in the flesh. Though I understand you prefer ”Shadowhunter“?

**ESTINIEN:** Hmph. You are in contact with the Scions, I take it.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Hmph. Through no choice of my own. They tracked me down, and conscripted me to their cause. I swear their receptionist was trained as a spy. Not that anyone can escape that Baldesion woman once she has caught the scent of your aether...

**ESTINIEN:** If they have resorted to using freelancers, I must assume their attempts to wake the afflicted have failed... And what of their champion?

**SHADOWHUNTER:** ...Away on other business. Thus it has fallen to me to root out any trace of the Empire's new weapon.

**ESTINIEN:** If it is Black Rose you seek, you are too late. My people have already completed your mission here. Yet this is but one factory among many. When they caught wind of our efforts, they built additional facilities to ensure production continues unabated. There will be no one left in the lands they conquer. No citizens to conscript, no skills to exploit, nothing the Empire needs. And they will call it *victory*.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** ...What exactly does this Black Rose do?

**GARLEANGENERAL:** The gas is described as a poison, but its actual effect is more arcane in nature. It was created to disrupt the aether in living beings─to bring the flow of their life energies to a standstill. Inhaling even the tiniest amount will cause all bodily functions to cease, much as a potent venom will stop a man's heart. Released over a city, Black Rose could conceivably kill every inhabitant, and all without damaging a single structure.

**ESTINIEN:** (-Imperial Pilus Prior-)Search every corner! Rouse the barracks if you have to! I want this facility secured!

**SHADOWHUNTER:** I have more questions, but now is not the time.

**ESTINIEN:** Ser Estinien. I have an offer for you, but I will make it only once. Since it would seem we seek the same answers...you are welcome to join us.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Hah! From what I hear, you need all the help you can get. In case you don't know, Varis himself confessed that your empire was a creation of the Ascians.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALISAIE:** You are come at a good time. As you may have heard, we have something of a quandary on our hands. Laxan Loft, here in Lakeland. Eulmore has sent one of its airships. They have questions for us concerning the death of the Lightwarden. Their emissary makes his way here even as we speak.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I suppose the sky does rather give the game away.

**LYNA:** Indeed. 'Twas inevitable they would come knocking. The only question was how soon.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** My lord. I am come with the Eulmoran emissary. May I show him in?

**RANJIT:** A moment, Captain, if you would. Everyone, gather round. I do not wish to show our hand prematurely. Forgive me this liberty. Vanish! Enter. Well, well... The commander of the Eulmoran Army himself. To what do I owe the honor, General Ran'jit?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** The Lightwarden is dead, Exarch. Were your people responsible?

**RANJIT:** You are clearly in some haste, my lord. But before I address your question, you must allow me one of my own. What is Eulmore's interest in this?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** His Benevolence Lord Vauthry is gravely concerned that the actions of an ignorant few may jeopardize relations between man and sin eater. Should it transpire that the Crystarium is guilty of abetting the villains responsible for this outrage... My lord has decreed that it suffer the same...retribution.

**RANJIT:** I see. Since you have been so candid, I too shall speak my mind. Regardless of who is responsible, the Crystarium *rejoices* in the Lightwarden's death, and welcomes the return of the night sky. If Eulmore considers this tantamount to aiding those you term “villains,” then by all means carry out your retribution. Know, however, that even should every innocent soul in the Crystarium perish, nothing can stop that which has been set in motion.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** <sigh> Folly. The death of one or a thousand thousand sin eaters changes nothing. The world is dead, and writhe as we might, like maggots in its rotting corse, it will *not* be reborn. Only by my master's grace may we live out our days in peace. But I waste my breath. You have made your stance clear. I shall relay your words to Lord Vauthry. In the meantime, you would do well to counsel any here who have done more than merely “rejoice” in recent events to throw themselves upon Eulmore's mercy. Promptly. One last matter. We are searching for a young artist and his assistant. Know you of whom I speak?

**RANJIT:** An artist and his assistant... No. I cannot say I do.

**ALISAIE:** What a pity. Should they *reveal* themselves to you, I bid you hand them over at once. My master is most eager to *see* them again.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Am I imagining things, or did he just stare straight at us?

**ALPHINAUD:** I fear he did. The general is not a man to be trifled with. He is a warrior of fearsome repute who has led Eulmore's army since before Vauthry's time, when the nation still spearheaded the fight against the sin eaters. One does not command the world's mightiest army, and for so long, without possessing exceptional instincts.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** If Eulmore chose to send such an individual, we must assume this talk of retribution is more than an idle threat. While we are grateful for your support, my lord─we cannot in good conscience put your people in harm's way.

**LYNA:** 'Tis noble of you to say, Master Alphinaud, but my people have been in harm's way since long before you arrived. Eulmore has ever yearned to rule over what remains of the world. Even should we surrender the Warrior of Darkness to them, they would find some other pretext upon which to invade. The people of the Crystarium know this only too well, which is why, when the time comes, I am certain they will fight to the last man. If truth be told, I would not have been surprised had Ran'jit declared war here and now...

**000:** He may have reason to delay. According to reports, the Eulmoran forces at Laxan Loft were observed taking a prisoner. A young woman believed to be none other than the Oracle of Light─Minfilia. It may be that General Ran'jit wishes to convey her to Eulmore before commencing hostilities. Having mentored generations of Minfilias, it would not surprise me if he had made her capture his chief concern.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Wait, is this *the* Minfilia? I'm sorry, “generations of Minfilias”?

**ALISAIE:** Ah, of course. How remiss of me. I had intended to speak to you of Minfilia. There is, however, much to say, and precious little time in which to say it... I think it best that you seek out Moren at the Cabinet of Curiosity. He will be able to enlighten you. Alphinaud, Alisaie─would you care to accompany your friend? You doubtless have insights of your own to offer on the matter.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** All right. Though I'm still not sure I understand it all myself...

**GLYNARD:** In the meantime, I will set about making provisions for war. You are doubtless eager to attempt Minfilia's rescue─and with your combined strength, you may well succeed. But as I said earlier, I do not wish to show our hand unless absolutely necessary. 'Twas not merely the night sky that you restored to us, but hope─hope for the future of Norvrandt. Unlike you, we cannot contend with the Lightwardens. But so long as hope burns in our hearts, we will fight on regardless. This I will prove to you. My friends, I thank you for gathering at such short notice. There is something I would ask you all. As many of you are aware, I received an emissary from Eulmore a short while ago─in the form of General Ran'jit. To my dismay, the general condemned the slaying of the Lightwarden, and warned me in no uncertain terms that, should the Crystarium cast its lot with the Warrior of Darkness, there would be war. Let none be mistaken: we would be hard-pressed indeed to resist the might of Eulmore. Some would even call it suicide. And yet my heart cries out to fight. Better that than relinquish the hope that swelled in my breast when I beheld the night sky for the first time in a hundred years. ...Or so says my heart. My mind, meanwhile, reminds me that to follow my heart would be to risk everything we have accomplished thus far. Clearly, this is not a decision to be made lightly─nor less alone. And so I put the question to you all. What should we do?

**BRAGI:** My lord, you already know our minds. It brought tears to our eyes to witness the night's return. The whole of Norvrandt deserves the same, and not just because some children's story tells us so.

**KATLISS:** Eulmore's influence is far-reaching. Should war break out, trade would be subject to restrictions. The flow of goods will dry up, and we will struggle to make do with what little trickles through... But make do we will.

**MOREN:** Aye, we can weather such hardships! Is that not the very thing the Crystarium was built for? We have always taken pride in our ability to sustain ourselves─not just to endure, but to thrive!

**CASSARD:** "When all falls down around you, rise up.“ Those were your words. "There may come a day when all hope seems lost. But even should the rest of the world give in to despair─we shall not. "We shall fight on, that our children and our children's children might know a better tomorrow.“

**GLYNARD:** Rousing words apart, I never much cared for those Eulmoran bastards anyway. No better than common swindlers, most of them. Wouldn't know a fair deal if it came up and kissed them on the arse!

**CASSARD:** Trust you to spoil the moment!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (BIG LAUGH)

**KATLISS:** It appears we have a consensus. Let it be known that the Eulmoran host at Laxan Loft has taken the Oracle of Light captive. They fear the power she holds over the sin eaters, and doubtless intend to imprison her once more. So I move that we rescue the Oracle, grant her a place among us, and let *that* be our answer to Eulmore's ultimatum!

**CASSARD:** Hear, hear!

**LYNA:** Hear, hear!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** In planning a strategy for the rescue, I open the floor to you all.

**ALPHINAUD:** And there you have it. If Eulmore wishes to denounce us as villains, then we shall embrace our villainy. Will you do so as well?

**LYNA:** (SIGH) We will not be outdone. Consider us your partners in crime.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** My lord, our proposal is as follows: we begin by deploying amaro to occupy the skies over Lakeland. They should serve to delay the airship's departure. At the same time, we scatter dream powder from the air. Not all will succumb to its effects, but it should thin the enemy's numbers, affording us an opening to swoop in and liberate the Oracle.

**ALISAIE:** Very good. See to your preparations.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And what exciting crimes would you have *us* commit? Speaking for my fellow villains, I'd say we're capable of most things─though we draw the line at indolence.

**EULMORESOLDIERA:** If excitement is your desire, then I bid you join the guard. Captain Lyna will give you your orders.

**EULMORESOLDIERB:** Keep moving! Eh? What now?

**EULMORESOLDIERA:** The Crystarium at a guess. Desperate fools. It'll take more than a handful of overgrown lizards to ground us!

**CRYSTARIUMGARDPICKET:** Oh, you've got to be─ Sound the alarum!

**LYNA:** Captain, the powder has taken effect!

**RANJIT:** It is time. Let us free the Oracle from their clutches!

**THANCRED:** You, boy. You bear a striking resemblance to the artist my master seeks. By all means, keep your counsel. You will all have ample time to confess your crimes back in Eulmore.

**RANJIT:** (CHARGING ATTACK)

**THANCRED:** (PARRYING ATTACK)

**RYNE:** (REELING FROM BLOW)

**RANJIT:** Thancred?

**THANCRED:** So! *You* are the wretch who stole her from us...

**RANJIT:** And what if I am!? What!? (REELING FROM BLOW)

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Pathetic. Vermin such as you are not worthy of the Oracle.

**RANJIT:** Break!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Fool! You would see your city razed?

**RANJIT:** I would sooner see it razed than conquered. Suffice it to say, we are ready to receive you.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What now, Exarch? Will you face me yourself?

**EMETSELCH:** I think not, General. I've quite exhausted my tricks. If you mean to give chase, I will not stand in your way. But you would do well to tread warily. For your quarry goes to a place where even Eulmore dare not bare its steel... Il Mheg, the faerie kingdom.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** (-???-)To think that mountain of indolence still had the energy to unleash his hounds... (-???-)Even the most pointless of conflicts may alter a world's course... And now the plan has gone awry. (-???-)But how...? How did the so-called Crystal Exarch bring the hero of the Source to the First? (-???-)As if I didn't have enough on my hands already... (SIGH) (-???-)Then again...with a soul such as that... (-???-)Mayhap there is another way. One which does not require bloodshed...

**THANCRED:** Not so long ago, here in the shadow of the northern ranges, lay the great Kingdom of Voeburt. A nation with a proud history...that the sin eaters cut short. Just like all the rest. Since that time, these lands have become a haven for fae folk. Dreamers frolicking amidst the ruins of a forgotten realm.

**ALISAIE:** We should be safe enough here. It's good to see you again, my friends. I don't know about you, but it feels like *years* since last we met. Five of them, in my case.

**THANCRED:** Why, it only feels like *one* to me. But long enough to warrant a more convivial reunion, either way. What brought you to Laxan Loft?

**ALPHINAUD:** The girl, Minfilia. She and I were traveling together, hunting sin eaters. But as we were nearing Lakeland, she abruptly ran off on her own. I found her too late to stop the Eulmorans from taking her prisoner. And as I was considering rescue options, I observed that the Crystarium was on the move. So I consulted the Exarch, who apprised me of the details of the operation─and issued me certain instructions. Should the situation take a turn for the worse, I was to see you all safely to Il Mheg. And here we are.

**THANCRED:** Urianger has called this place home for a while now. Yet we have never called upon him, I am ashamed to say. 'Twas only at the Crystarium that we met.

**ALISAIE:** Hardly surprising. This is not the sort of place one visits on a whim. Happily, having trespassed on Urianger's hospitality for a spell, Minfilia and I have an idea of how things work around here. Sooner or later, the Eulmorans will come after us. But before they do, the Exarch bids us accomplish two things. First, rendezvous with Urianger. And second, eliminate the Lightwarden of this land.

**RYNE:** So...Minfilia. What made you leave Thancred behind─if you don't mind me asking?

**THANCRED:** You. The hero from another world. I was asleep when I felt it. A presence. Someone I was meant to meet. They were close, and...and I knew I had to go to them. But with all the commotion in Lakeland, I was afraid that Thancred wouldn't...let me...

**RYNE:** And would I have been wrong? Had I arrived a moment later, you would be back in your cell in Eulmore. And now we have Ran'jit snapping at our heels! You really have outdone yourself this time.

**YSIALA:** I'm sorry. Thank you for saving me.

**SULUIN:** (-???-)Awww, poor thing, being scolded so.

**OULSIGUN:** Poor thing!

**ALISAIE:** Poor, poor thing!

**SULUIN:** Who said that? Show yourselves!

**YSIALA:** (-???-)Come now, put away that frown and have some fun with us!

**OULSIGUN:** Yes, let's have some fun!

**THANCRED:** Lots and lots of fun!

**RYNE:** Ugh, which way was it to Urianger's?

**THANCRED:** We've been there so many times, but I'm not... I can't... Why can't I remember?

**SULUIN:** Damn it all. We're already caught in their spell!

**YSIALA:** (LAUGHTER)

**OULSIGUN:** (LAUGHTER)

**THANCRED:** (LAUGHTER)

**SULUIN:** [I've found you. The game is over.]

**YSIALA:** Nooo, we are found! How did this mortal know our trick!?

**OULSIGUN:** Wait, I recognize their souls! These two have been here before!

**YSIALA:** Look, look─twins! How adorable!

**OULSIGUN:** Awww!

**THANCRED:** Play with us!

**SULUIN:** We have neither the time nor inclination to play. We have come to see Urianger.

**OULSIGUN:** Ohhh yes, Urianger! The peculiar one! In return for a place in Il Mheg, he agreed to a riddle contest with us! For seven days and seven nights! Without any sleep! Ahahahahahaha!

**THANCRED:** Ah, that was so much fun! We *must* do it again!

**SULUIN:** I'm sure he'd be delighted. Now, if you'd be so kind as to lift your spell...

**YSIALA:** Shall we?

**OULSIGUN:** Should we?

**ALISAIE:** Would we?

**THANCRED:** What now?

**SULUIN:** I don't know. But this is their home, so we must indulge them.

**THANCRED:** Right, we've made up our minds! We will lift our spell on one condition: that you first lend us a helping hand! Or two. Or three! Once you've helped solve all of our troubles, we'll let you see Urianger. Pixie's honor!

**FEOUL:** Well, there you have it. Pixie chores. I suggest we split up.

**ALISAIE:** Grrr...unnngh... You...you! You're late! Late, late, late! I've been waiting for you to summon me ever since you came here! Waiting and waiting and waiting! But my sapling didn't so much as utter my name! Such a heartless thing she is! Cold and cruel and *heartless*!

**ALPHINAUD:** Another self-important little brat. Just what we need.

**FEOUL:** Hmm. Reminds me of my childhood. Alright, I'm sorry! It was a joke! Honestly, just a joke!

**SULUIN:** But just now, you called for me so earnestly, so fervently... I couldn't possibly stay angry at you. Very well! As your lovely branch, I will lend you my strength!

**FEOUL:** Well well well! If it isn't Feo Ul, the [Madbloom]! It's been too, too long!

**YSIALA:** Not long enough for you to think of any new games, though, apparently! If I were you, I'd be *bored* of myself. Now, let me make something clear: that mortal is *mine*! No matter what you do, she will *never* be yours. Never, never, *ever*!

**FEOUL:** Awww, not even a bit? But...what about the others? Surely we can keep them?

**OULSIGUN:** No, no, no! You can't keep them either! They're for *my* amusement, and mine alone! And if you lay so much as a finger on my sapling, I'll scatter the contents of her bag all over your precious village! There'll be cold, hard metal! Furry, festering food! Stinky, sweaty smallclothes! And...and all manner of other terrible, unmentionable things! How would you like that, hmm!?

**SULUIN:** All right, all right... But will you not at least let us play with the twins? Just while the others go and see Urianger?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye, aye, that's all we ask! And we promise we'll play nicely.

**YSIALA:** ...It seems we won't be joining you.

**ALISAIE:** Aye, haha! We'll reveal the hidden [truth] to you at once!

**THANCRED:** So this is the true Il Mheg...

**RYNE:** How are you feeling?

**THANCRED:** Better. I think I remember the way now.

**FEOUL:** Apologies for the delay. Shall we go and see Urianger?

**THANCRED:** Your lovely branch is useful, yes? So whenever you're in trouble, you must remember to *make use of me*!

**URIANGER:** Urianger! Are you in?

**THANCRED:** Unto a world weary of heroes, a hero wends her way... The Exarch did send word that thou wouldst seek me out, but ne'er did I imagine thou wouldst arrive so soon... Full glad am I to see thee once more, my friend, and none the worse for thy travails.

**RYNE:** Run along, Minfilia. We will meet you outside.

**THANCRED:** But...

**URIANGER:** Another one for you to imbue, if you'd be so kind.

**000:** I take it thou hast met with our other comrades already? Hmm. That Master Alphinaud and Mistress Alisaie now travel in thy company is of great comfort to me. As for the rest... It beginneth in earnest... The hunting of the Lightwardens, and perforce the war with Eulmore. Hark thee, then, to my words, and through them behold the vision that I did glimpse─that of the Eighth Umbral Calamity. As I drifted hither to the First, traversing the boundary 'twixt reality and potentiality, I did bear witness to events yet to come... There I saw the combined forces of Eorzea and the Far East offering fierce resistance to the legions of Garlemald. So fierce, in fact, that they did begin to push the enemy back. Ilm by painful ilm, at first, then yalm by yalm, and malm by malm in time. Yet the joy they felt was short-lived, for in so doing, they did force the Empire's hand. Faced with defeat, the Garleans turned to a weapon most vile─Black Rose. Its potency defied all reckoning. Once released, the gas took on a life of its own, wreaking untold carnage not only in Eorzea, but in the provinces of the Empire besides. From fighters upon the front lines to babes in their beds, none were spared. And as the casualties became too numerous to count, so did the fabric of civilization begin to unravel. Nor did the land itself escape unscathed. For spreading from the site of its release, Black Rose brought death to the very soil. To survive amidst the chaos and upheaval, men came to live by the sword, the rule of law giving way, inevitably, to the rule of might. Thus was the spark struck and the fire kindled, and swiftly did it spread, as a blaze in a field of straw, to engulf every corner of the world. Nations worthy of the name did then cease to exist. And those souls brave and true, who might have risen to restore order... ...were no more. For the weapon spared not one. Not even thee. An endless age of war, begotten by the blight of Black Rose... Such is the legacy of the Eighth Umbral Calamity which I did behold. No matter the cost, we must forestall this tragedy. To that end, I have labored during my sojourn in this world, discovering in so doing the answer to a pressing mystery. That of Black Rose's inexplicable potency. Come. Dost thou recognize yonder chart?

**URIANGER:** What will you say? It's a chart of the elements. It's...something to do with magic.

**THANCRED:** Indeed. 'Tis a rendering of the elemental wheel, such as one might find in classrooms across the Source. As the chart maketh plain, our world is composed of six elements, in addition to which there exist two poles in fundamental opposition. Astral, the active; umbral, the passive. As a reflection of the Source, the First naturally compriseth the selfsame forces, yet curiously, there is a notable divergence in their nomenclature. To be specific, the denizens of this world employ not the terms astral and umbral. Thus was I moved to inquire what names said forces had been assigned. A simple question which yielded a most unexpected answer... Upon demanding the name of the pole aligned with activity and growth, I was told that as life's myriad colors combine to produce black, the people of the First had called it “Darkness.” At this did my mind begin to race. Yet 'twas only when I asked what name had been given to the pole aligned with passivity that mine eyes were opened to the truth. Peace and tranquility being as purest white unmarred by color, I was told, it had been given the name of “Light.”

**URIANGER:** That's umbral light and astral darkness, yes? ...I'm no aetherologist, but it strikes me that the nomenclature of the First is rooted in the generation of the two forces, while our own appears to focus on their effects. Which makes one wonder...have we had it backwards all this time?

**THANCRED:** 'Tis indeed a compelling question, and one which beareth closer examination. Yet what knowledge we already possess sufficeth to explain the chain of events. The phenomenon of aetheric thinning observed in the Source is the consequence of Light─the power of stasis─flowing in from the First to stifle the movement of aether within the land. And according to Master Alphinaud, Black Rose slayeth by halting the circulation of aether within living beings. Should such a weapon be unleashed even as the First were rejoined, replete as it is with Light...

**URIANGER:** ...We would have a disaster of untold proportions on our hands. A calamity. Well...at least we have a better grasp of what we're facing. Our objective, however, remains unchanged. We are to eliminate the Lightwarden of Il Mheg. Speaking of which, were you able to ascertain its whereabouts?

**RYNE:** Aye. 'Tis all but certainly ensconced within Lyhe Ghiah, the castle which standeth in the midst of the lake. To enter said stronghold, we must needs turn to the pixies for aid. Fortunately, I have become quite adept at courting their cooperation. Henceforth shall I accompany you, and do all in my power to ensure that my vision doth not come to pass. 'Tis done. The pixies shall be well pleased with these gifts. Ah, lest I forget... White auracite, newly forged for thy use. Our mission being to thwart a Rejoining, we will most assuredly cross paths with those who crave the contrary. Our eternal enemies. Thus did I choose to abide in this aether-rich land, the better to fashion a trap for the Ascians' essence.

**THANCRED:** May I come in now?

**RYNE:** You may indeed─assuming you've finished.

**THANCRED:** I did as you asked.

**URIANGER:** That's my girl. Thank you. I should probably explain. Though my body remained behind in the Source, its limitations saw fit to accompany me. Which is to say, I cannot manipulate aether. I took up the gunblade for its defensive advantages, but on account of my little impairment, I cannot imbue the ammunition myself. Luckily for me, Minfilia has quite a talent for it.

**RYNE:** Minfilia. Once we set forth, we are not like to return for some while. If thou wouldst choose tomes to take with thee, let it be now.

**URIANGER:** Really? May I?

**THANCRED:** Of course, my dear. Yet have care thou dost not add overmuch to thy burden, lest I incur Thancred's ire. Hast thou spoken to her of thine encounter with the Minfilia of eld?

**MINFILIA:** Well, I suppose now is as good a time as any. As you know, I freed young Minfilia from captivity in Eulmore some three years past. Not long after, the two of us journeyed to the south of Amh Araeng. To the edge of the Empty, where the Flood was halted. 'Twas there that she awakened. The Minfilia of old. My Minfilia... Tell me, tell me! What must I do to bring you back!?

**THANCRED:** (-Oracle of Light-)My dearest Thancred... As I am now, I am no different from an Ascian. This child is but a vessel. (-Oracle of Light-)One of many I have used, that I might spread word of Her enduring blessing and preserve the flame of hope. (-Oracle of Light-)In my name, each has died never having lived her own life. (-Oracle of Light-)I have taken enough from these children. I will take no more.

**MINFILIA:** But what of your suffering? Your sacrifice!? This isn't fair! I will not stand for it─I cannot! There must be something we can do. Tell me!

**THANCRED:** (-Oracle of Light-)Should the day come when this child grows weary of fighting, and wishes to cast it all aside... (-Oracle of Light-)Then shall I take up her burden. (-Oracle of Light-)But should she wish instead to become the master of her own destiny... (-Oracle of Light-)Then shall I bequeath to her my all. (-Oracle of Light-)Imbued with the strength that I reserve for rebirth, she may come to wield my powers as her own.

**MINFILIA:** And what of *my* wishes!? What of F'lhaminn's!? What of all the people who love and care for you and want nothing more than to see you again!?

**THANCRED:** (-Oracle of Light-)It is not their decision to make. (-Oracle of Light-)It is hers. This child's. This Minfilia's. (-Oracle of Light-)You have ever watched over me, Thancred. (-Oracle of Light-)Now I ask that you do the same for her. Protect her. Teach her. Stand by her as you stood by me. (-Oracle of Light-)There is much and more she does not know. She needs a guide to show her the ways of the world, or she will never find her own path. (-Oracle of Light-)When the time comes, you will find me here. Until that day...

**RYNE:** Minfilia, wait!

**THANCRED:** What...what happened?

**000:** ...And then she was gone. Minfilia─the girl─claims to have no recollection of any of it. I've told her many things─where we came from, what we fight for. But of that day, I have not spoken.

**URIANGER:** What will you say? How do you want this to end? ...

**RYNE:** With the coming of another possessed of the blessing of Light, the First hath begun to rise up in defiance of its fate. The question remaineth, however... Who shall take up the flame of hope which Minfilia hath borne for so long? Whether we will it or no, the choice must soon be made.

**URIANGER:** I'm sorry I took so long. It was so hard to choose. In the end, I settled on just the one.

**SOMEONEOFFUATHA:** That is well. Now, if all is in order, let us set forth for Lydha Lran.

**SOMEONEOFFUATHB:** (-Amused Fuath-)Hah hah! Well fought, well fought!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHC:** Bravo!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHD:** Amazing!

**BOSSOFFUATH:** Jolly good show!

**URIANGER:** Ohh! You do not hold back... But I would have it no other way! Seldom have I enjoyed such sport!

**BOSSOFFUATH:** We have satisfied thy demands. Wilt thou now satisfy ours?

**SOMEONEOFFUATHA:** Of course! Of course... There it is, the relic you seek! Yours for the taking. Have care you do not break it, though, yes? Ah, but you, my friend... You are mighty indeed...and pleasing to the eye besides!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHB:** (-Amused Fuath-)More! I want to see more of her!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHC:** (-Mischievous Fuath-)Yes, yes! I could watch her forever!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHD:** (-Enthusiastic Fuath-)Why don't we just make her one of us?

**SOMEONEOFFUATHA:** (-Delighted Fuath-)Yesss! One of us!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHB:** One of us! One of us! One of us!

**SOMEONEOFFUATHC:** One of us! One of us! One of us!

**BOSSOFFUATH:** One of us! One of us! One of us!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Wahaha! What a fine idea! Why ever didn't I think of that!? You may have the crown...but in exchange, we will have *you*!

**RYNE:** Wake up! Wake up, damn you! Oh, you're alive! Thank the gods. I don't know where you learned to breathe underwater, but it's lucky you can. I'm sure you had your reasons, but the first rule of dealing with the Fuath...is do *not* deal with the Fuath. It's said that they are born from the souls of the drowned. Were it not for your little trick, you'd have joined them. Your friends are safely back on dry land, in case you were wondering. They'll be searching for you, I expect. That's the royal capital of the Kingdom of Voeburt down there. It's seen better days. They were a stubborn lot, the Voeburtites. Set in their ways. But once you got to know them, you couldn't find a more welcoming people. It always froze over in winter, being up in the mountains. So we'd pull up our chairs round the fire and trade tales over steaming bowls of lamb stew, while the street lamps burned hot and bright outside... All dead and buried now. Them and anyone else who might remember. Everything we did...everything we *gave*... What was it for? I wond─ I *hope* you'll have a better answer than this when all's said and done.

**000:** Oh, thank goodness. There you are. Those Nu Mou were rather frightening. I'm glad you're safe.

**RYNE:** What will you say? I'm glad you're safe too. I see you use daggers. You don't need to worry about me.

**OLDTITANIA:** I haven't seen much actual combat, so I was a little nervous, but I'm happy I could help. Thancred taught me─but I'm still a novice. No. Of course. How silly of me. You're a hero... The Minfilias before me battled sin eaters as part of the Eulmoran Army. But that had all changed by the time I was found. They held me captive so that I wouldn't follow in the others' footsteps. I'd still be in my cell now had Thancred not spirited me away. When he found me, I knew nothing of the world. I didn't know how to live, let alone fight. Thancred once told me that if the efforts to summon you failed, it would fall to me to face the Lightwardens. I realized then that it was the only reason he kept me close─as a contingency. The truth is, he can't stand to be around me. Because I'm not her. I'm not his Minfilia. ...Once, we journeyed to Nabaath Areng together. To the place where the Oracle appeared and stayed the Flood. As we drew near, I felt as though...I was fading away... I shut my eyes and covered my ears, and then... And then... I'm not sure what happened after that. I have a vague feeling that I said something to him. Only it wasn't me at all. It was *her*. Afterwards, Thancred didn't say a word. Only kept to himself and brooded. There's nothing I can do for him. Nothing I can offer but my presence─though it only reminds him of his loss. She should be the one to live on. That's why I tried to find you─because I *knew* that was what she wanted. But now that you're here...I'm not entirely sure what it was she intended me to do. Was I meant to tell you something? Or bring you to someone? Or some*where*? I can feel the answer at the edge of my mind, just out of reach─ Ahhh! What...what is that!?

**RYNE:** Why? Why did you imprison us? Such boredom...such *tedium* have we suffered. It is unfair! *Unfair*! Come. Come and play with us...

**SETO:** It came from the castle. This is everything I have. Please see it delivered to the Nu Mou. I will bear word to Thancred and the others.

**URIANGER:** Ah! My medallion! You found it! Oh, I know not how to thank you. It is my most treasured possession─a gift from a dear, departed soul. He was a traveler, and together we journeyed to the ends of the world and back again. When I was young. In those days, I could not speak, but we found joy in each other's company nonetheless. Oh, the memories... This medallion he found during an adventure─fashioned it into a necklace for me, his “partner in crime.” I had not the words to tell him then, but it filled my heart with pride. I was so, so happy... His name was Ardbert, and he was my friend.

**SETO:** *Ardbert*, thou sayest...?

**000:** Everyone blamed him for the Flood. Him and his comrades. Some few spoke up for them─of the many whose lives they had touched. But as the years went by, their voices were drowned out by those who only uttered the adventurers' names as a curse... It was too much to bear. And so I left behind men and their lies and came to this place. Ardbert was a trusting soul, constantly being drawn into the troubles of others. Yet in spite of this, he never thought twice when he saw someone in need. He always tried to help. It was no different then. The world needed heroes─it needed him. And yet... He was a good man. He deserved to be happy. I wish I could have told him that, at least...

**SETO:** What will you say? I'm sure Ardbert knows how you feel. Keep your medallion safe. ...

**OULSIGUN:** You remind me of him. Your kindness... When we amaro were created, we were granted the ability to perceive souls. Thus did we recognize our masters. That ability has long since faded from our kind. But due perhaps to my reversion, I can see your soul. Faintly but surely. It is reminiscent of Ardbert's. Strikingly so. Of course, you are you, and no one else. We are defined not by the soul we are born with, but the path we walk. Nevertheless...I cannot help but feel that this is more than mere coincidence... ...Which is why I will place my faith in you. The relic─it is yours.

**THANCRED:** There's trouble! Terrible trouble!

**OULSIGUN:** Has something happened at Lydha Lran?

**THANCRED:** Together with the twins, we were playing tricks on some nasty mortals to stop them from setting foot in Il Mheg. At first they ran off screaming, which was lots of fun! But then a scary, bony, *wrinkly* old mortal came along and spoiled everything! None of our tricks seem to work on him, which is no fun at all, and now they're getting closer and closer...

**URIANGER:** Ran'jit. If he manages to find his way in, all our efforts will have been for naught.

**THANCRED:** As thou sayest. Should we be discovered ere our mission here is complete, and the Lightwarden yet liveth, our task will be rendered nigh impossible. If we are to prevail, we must needs divide our forces. Thus do I propose the following... Whilst thou salliest forth to meet with the Lightwarden, we shall join in the effort to obstruct the trespassers. Should we succeed in staying their advance, all the better. Yet even should we fail, if we can but delay our enemy's arrival long enough for thee to secure victory, our plan may still be deemed a success.

**RYNE:** So the moment the lights go out, we all beat a hasty retreat, yes?

**THANCRED:** Let me come with you! I have the blessing too!

**RYNE:** No, Minfilia. You'll only get underfoot. Now, come.

**FEOUL:** I wish there were more I could do. Please be careful...

**ALPHINAUD:** You have freed our fallen king. Not that I expected any less, my [adorable sapling]. The dress, the crown, the scepter, the shoes─the time has come for these relics to serve their true purpose. For they are not only keys to the castle; they are also blessings to be bestowed upon the new king. The way into the castle is opened when it is time to relieve the reigning monarch of the throne. And the brave soul who does the deed has the honor of taking their place. However...should you ascend the throne, you will become one of us, never again to live as men do. My adorable sapling. My precious mortal. We fae folk live forever, but such is not your virtue. To strive for a dream you will never see─to sow seeds that others might one day taste the fruits of your garden─that is the beauty of your kind. Burn bright and shine as only you can. These blessings, your lovely branch will accept in your stead. [Rejoice and revel, for the Kingdom of Rainbows is forever young.] Now, shall we attend to those unwise enough to trespass in our realm?

**SULUIN:** Confound it! How did they get here so fast...?

**YSIALA:** (LAUGHTER)

**OULSIGUN:** (LAUGHTER)

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** (LAUGHTER)

**YSIALA:** Damn these pixies and their tricks!

**ALPHINAUD:** (CRYING OUT IN PAIN)

**RANJIT:** How in the seven hells!?

**YSIALA:** Listen well! We come in pursuit of villains who have fled to this land. You know who and where they are. Now, show yourselves and answer me...before I lose my patience.

**ALPHINAUD:** Owww! Stop! It hurts, it hurts! (CRYING OUT IN PAIN)

**RANJIT:** Enough! Lift the enchantment!

**RYNE:** Minfilia. Willful child. How many times must I come to collect you?

**RANJIT:** I won't return to Eulmore! And I won't let you hurt my friends!

**ALISAIE:** What is this stance? Where did you learn it!? No Oracle I trained would make such an unseemly show of herself! Know your shame, girl! You are powerless! You have no life nor purpose save that which our master sees fit to permit!

**THANCRED:** (ATTACK GRUNT)

**RANJIT:** (ATTACK GRUNT)

**THANCRED:** (BLOCKING GRUNT)

**RANJIT:** Who are you to dictate her purpose? To lock her away and deny her a life!? If she was powerless, it's because of you, you sanctimonious swine. But no longer.

**ALISAIE:** Fool. Defiance only begets more suffering. It is through acceptance alone that one may find solace in this godsforsaken world.

**ALPHINAUD:** Look─the sky!

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** She's done it! The Warrior of Darkness has triumphed!

**RANJIT:** General? What are our orders? What do we do!?

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** We do what we came to do. Subdue this rabble, and find the Warrior of Darkness.

**SULUIN:** Forward, men! Take the villains captive! Are you deaf!? I said─!

**YSIALA:** (LAUGHTER)

**OULSIGUN:** (LAUGHTER)

**SULUIN:** (LAUGHTER)

**YSIALA:** [The king is returned!]

**OULSIGUN:** [Make ready the feast!]

**EULMORESOLDIERC:** [Make ready the feast!]

**EULMORESOLDIERA:** What's...what's happening!? Water? That wasn't there before... (SCREAMING)

**EULMORESOLDIERB:** (SCREAMING)

**SOMEONEOFNUMOUA:** (SCREAMING)

**SOMEONEOFNUMOUB:** [The night is delightful. Dance we shall!]

**EULMORESOLDIERA:** [The night is delightful. Sing we shall!]

**EULMORESOLDIERB:** (SCREAMING)

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** Help meeeeee!

**RANJIT:** What's the matter with you!? Get a hold of yourselves, damn it! General, they come in greater numbers! We must retreat!

**ALISAIE:** All who stand with the Warrior of Darkness shall face justice! My master demands it.

**ALPHINAUD:** I see... Well, it's a good thing Feo Ul volunteered to become king in your stead─for all our sakes.

**FEOUL:** We are grateful for your timely aid, Feo Ul─or should I say, Your Majesty.

**RYNE:** 'Twas the first night in recent memory. We all of us but wished to make the most of it. That's something you must remember about us fae folk. Though our existence may be eternal, we exist only for the present. We live in the here and now, paying no mind to futures that may or may not be. To wit, we are not driven as men are. We cannot fight for such causes as men do.

**FEOUL:** Does that mean you won't aid us against the sin eaters?

**000:** Not unless the mood takes us. But if it was to repay a debt? Well then, that's another matter. To take back as much as is taken. To create as much as is destroyed. To give as much as is received. Such is the way of Il Mheg. By this law, we shall lend you our strength─in return for the beautiful sky you have restored to us. In times of need, do not hesitate to call.

**FEOUL:** What will you say? I'll be sad to lose you. What about our pact?

**ALPHINAUD:** Silly sapling, I shall remain at your side! Even should my body be in the castle, 'tis a simple thing to have a little part of me accompany you. Treat them as you would your [beautiful branch].

**ALISAIE:** All seems well at the Crystarium.

**EMETSELCH:** Yes. Eulmore was plainly more concerned with finding us. How flattering.

**ALISAIE:** (-???-)You certainly took your time. I had half-resolved to complete the task myself.

**URIANGER:** And you are?

**EMETSELCH:** Were one to study the annals of Garlean history, one would find yonder visage on many a page. Though by rights its youth should long since have faded.

**ALISAIE:** (-???-)Well, well, we have a historian in our midst. That spares me a lengthy explanation. (-Solus zos Galvus-)I am Solus zos Galvus, founding father of the Garlean Empire. And, under various guises, the architect of myriad other imperially inclined nations. (-Solus zos Galvus-)As for my true identity... I am Emet-Selch. Ascian.

**THANCRED:** Gaius spoke of you! A native of the Source...

**EMETSELCH:** Equal in rank to Lahabrea. And you came all this way just to introduce yourself to us?

**THANCRED:** Behold the sky, restored to its former glory! Have you ever seen a more affecting spectacle? Ohhh, it is truly, deeply... ...Infuriating. Do you have any idea how much you have delayed the Rejoining? Following the Flood, the First had been listing ever further towards the Light─towards stasis. The end was in sight! Enter man and his indomitable spirit. *He* would haul the world back from the brink! And adding his lumpen weight to the power of growth, he duly tipped the scales, if only by a fraction. Yet a fraction was enough to spoil the perfect imbalance needed to bring about a Rejoining! Had mankind continued to live in idleness under Vauthry's rule, all the conditions would have been met... But *you* had to come and ruin it all! Thanks to your meddling, Light's supremacy is in doubt, and our painstakingly laid plans are in tatters!

**EMETSELCH:** Well, I should begin by thanking you for confirming Urianger's theories on the inner workings of the Calamity. He will be most pleased. As for what happens next, might I suggest you admit defeat and walk away?

**ALPHINAUD:** Happy to let me go, are you? Because the murderous glint in your eye suggests otherwise. Indeed, it is enough to make me think better of confronting you alone. Look, it did cross my mind to simply side with Vauthry and kill you all. But that's no different from what Lahabrea did. And we all know how well that ended for him. And so, while it is liable to be troublesome, I have settled upon a different approach... Cooperation! I will not raise a hand to hinder your hunt for the Lightwardens. If you desire it, I will even lend you my knowledge and strength.

**EMETSELCH:** Since time immemorial, you and yours have labored to rejoin the thirteen shards, at the cost of countless lives. Do you expect us to believe that your objective has suddenly changed?

**URIANGER:** Nay, our objective is the same as it ever was─though I daresay you do not know our motive. A war waged without knowledge of the enemy is no war─it is mere bloodletting. Just once...might we not seek to find common ground? For good or ill, I am immortal. Provided I have the inclination, I can always begin anew. Scheme and conspire to my heart's content. But this time, I thought that I might instead try to see eye to eye. To understand what drives the hero of the Source. To determine if our goals are truly incompatible. So come. Shed your preconceptions. See beyond the unscrupulous villains you take us for. When all is said and done, we may find ourselves pleasantly surprised. The proud discoverers of a path of cooperation rather than opposition. Think of it.

**EMETSELCH:** Thou hast delivered thy proposal, and we would not dismiss it outright. If I may offer thee counsel, however: to make thy case via an illusion reflecteth poorly upon thy sincerity.

**SYSTEM:** My apologies. You will forgive me if I am not entirely at ease in the presence of a famed Ascian-slayer. I felt it only prudent to take precautions. Nonetheless, your counsel is duly noted. I take my leave, friends. Rest assured, we shall meet again soon.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** (-Handwritten Missive-)"I hope the past few days have not been overly taxing. Pray take your rest and recover.“

**000:** From the Exarch, is it? With that mirror of his, he can watch your every move, you know. He'll probably think you're talking to yourself. Still, he's keeping you well fed. Judging by his people's faith in him, he seems to be a decent sort. But so much about him remains shrouded in mystery. Like what was he doing back in my day? There was no such person when I was around. A lot's happened since the Flood, though. Since I was...set adrift. I know little more than you do of this city's history and the Exarch's past. Not that it matters. It's Emet-Selch we should be concerned about. When our world was about to be consumed by Light, the Ascian in white appeared before us. He said that the only way for us to live on was to bring about the Rejoining. Desperate as we were, we heeded his words, not realizing that the Flood was of the Ascians' own making. They cannot be trusted. None of them. But Emet-Selch had one thing right: one should not fight blindly. That's what we did. And it cost us everything we held dear.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? Not everything. Tell me about Seto. You're putting me off my dinner.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**EMETSELCH:** Ah, there you are. You're just in time to welcome our guest...

**THANCRED:** Please. Did I not explicitly tell you that we would be meeting again soon? Lest you forget, I made you a promise. I have no intention of meddling with your mission. I come only to observe. Your Exarch friend in particular has piqued my curiosity. Summoning you all like that. Most impressive.

**EMETSELCH:** You honestly expect us to believe you've come only to observe? Or that you might deign to lift a finger to aid our cause if called upon? Even if there were a sliver of truth in your words, I would never accept your help. Not in my darkest hour─not after all the suffering your kind has wrought.

**ALISAIE:** So petty. I meant what I said and I said what I meant. Wage your war against the sin eaters. Put each and every Lightwarden to the sword. Prove yourselves heroes brave and true, and I will be glad to embrace you as allies. Allies worthy of bearing the burden of truth. Surely such a partnership would be preferable to yet another round of fisticuffs? ...And thus did the olive branch wither and die. Pity. Well─let no man say I did not try, futile as it was. Though I suspect you will seek me out when you grow tired of making the same mistakes. Difficult decisions lie ahead of you. Decisions best made with the benefit of knowledge to which only the eternal are privy. For now, I shall resume my shadowy vigil. Whatever you choose to do, make sure it's worth watching, would you.

**THANCRED:** What was that all about?

**000:** A vain attempt to make us doubt our chosen course, most like. As if we'd believe a word that passed his lips. Unless you think there is some truth in what he says?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? A kernel, perhaps... Not one jot. I don't know. But if he crosses us, I'll make him wish he hadn't.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** If he simply meant to lead us astray, he could have done so without revealing himself. At least, not in the manner he did. I share your suspicion, of course. But if he simply meant to lead us astray, he could have done so without revealing himself. At least, not in the manner he did. I am sure you will. But consider for a moment: if he meant simply to lead us astray, he could have done so without revealing himself. At least, not in the manner he did. It goes without saying that an alliance with the Ascians is out of the question. But since we have no way of knowing where they might be hiding, it seems only logical to press on with our mission─even if our enemy seems content for it to succeed.

**THANCRED:** Then let us discuss the sin eaters. I would begin by thanking you all for your efforts thus far. In striking down the Lightwardens of Lakeland and Il Mheg, you have accomplished more in your short time here than all of our forces managed in the last century.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** That may be, but the Wardens of Kholusia, Amh Araeng, and Rak'tika remain.

**ALISAIE:** Indeed. And their precise whereabouts are as yet unknown. Which is why I propose we divide our forces and conduct a systematic survey of each region. Once we have found our quarry, we may then determine how best to proceed.

**ALPHINAUD:** I'll take Amh Araeng, in that case. I know the lie of the land well enough.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** If there are no objections, I will make for Kholusia. I have connections there both in and around Eulmore that may prove useful.

**RYNE:** Then I would ask that you journey to Rak'tika. There you will find Y'shtola. With her assistance, I doubt the Warden will evade your grasp for long.

**THANCRED:** Is Y'shtola the conjurer you and Urianger used to talk about?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** That's right. Though we haven't spoken much since she left for the forest.

**URIANGER:** I fear I may be to blame for that. I had every intention of relaying the news of your arrival, but she is...disinclined to speak with me. You have visited her, have you not? Might I trouble you to...?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** 'Twould be no trouble.

**ALISAIE:** My thanks. While you are all out in the field, I shall be here attending to business. I had somewhat fancifully contemplated joining the search myself, but other matters demand my attention.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What's that?

**ALISAIE:** A missive from Lord Vauthry. He invites me to join him in Eulmore to discuss the recent conflict at Lydha Lran.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And? Did he even bother to offer any bait? It's obviously a trap.

**ALPHINAUD:** I should be surprised if it were not. Nevertheless, I must seize this opportunity to speak with him, even if only a few words are exchanged. Though my power will be much diminished so far from the tower, it is a risk I am willing to take. Master Alphinaud─might I impose upon you to accompany me to Eulmore, prior to beginning your reconnaissance?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Of course.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Then let us make ready. Safe travels to you all.

**URIANGER:** No matter how far he goes, man cannot resist looking back on the path he has walked. The untold stories and secrets of the past can be more alluring than the promise of tomorrow. And so he braves the forests of Rak'tika in search of mystery and wonder... Of Ronka, to which all seekers of hidden truths are inevitably drawn...

**EMETSELCH:** We have arrived. Vast though these woods may be, they are, by and large, uninhabitable. Not so the swamps of Citia, however, whose sparse foliage permitted man a foothold.

**THANCRED:** "No lands must remain beyond our grasp. Go forth. Conquer. Rule.“ Forgive me. A sudden pang of nostalgia for those halcyon days. Exploring virgin territories, subjugating primitive peoples. All for the glory of Garlemald!

**EMETSELCH:** If you've brought your ivory standard, I'll be happy to tell you where to stick it.

**RYNE:** Can we not simply take a moment to enjoy the view together? Or would you rather I spied on you from the shadows? Much more of this, and I may very well begin to regret my show of good faith.

**EMETSELCH:** If...if you really want to stay, then help us fight.

**THANCRED:** Mmm... No, I think not. I am an observer─nothing more. Even shielded by the shadows of these boughs, I feel the Light's presence most keenly. To accompany you is taxing enough. To fight is out of the question.

**URIANGER:** I will suffer your company if I must, but not your commentary.

**RUNAR:** I see little sign of recent activity, nor hath any meaningful progress been made with the reconstruction... Mayhap Y'shtola sought shelter elsewhere. Come, let us quit this place.

**THANCRED:** (-Blessed Leader-)Now! Surround them! (-Blessed Leader-)These sin eaters─they are not like the others!

**PEOPLEOFNIGHTA:** There's a reason for that. Lower your weapons, please. We mean you no harm.

**PEOPLEOFNIGHTB:** How is it they can speak!?

**000:** It's a sin eater trick! They mean to kill us all!

**PEOPLEOFNIGHTA:** What will you say? Please! We're not sin eaters! Uh... Kupo? ...

**THANCRED:** Perhaps they speak the truth.

**EMETSELCH:** ...That will seem a lot less amusing when we are forced to kill them.

**PEOPLEOFNIGHTA:** Oh, for the love of... I had hoped that by accompanying you, we might come to understand one another, but all I have come to understand is that you have a knack for inflaming the natives. You've committed the cardinal sin of *boring* me. And so I retire to the shade. Good luck.

**THANCRED:** There! Did you see that one disappear!?

**YSHTOLA:** (SIGH) I think I preferred Lahabrea.

**RUNAR:** (-???-)Enough. Runar, report.

**YSHTOLA:** Master Matoya! We apprehended them as you ordered, but...are you certain these are sin eaters?

**URIANGER:** The intense light of the aether I saw was unmistakable. If not sin eaters, then what?

**YSHTOLA:** 'Tis passing queer that Y'shtola should mistake us for the enemy, is it not? Mayhap it hath been too long since last she beheld the radiance of thine aether... Master Matoya. Hath time truly made strangers of us?

**URIANGER:** Nay. I recognize you, Urianger, Thancred. And this is Minfilia of the First, of whom you spoke before.

**YSHTOLA:** Just so. And knowing as thou must that we come in peace, might I prevail upon thee to have thy comrades lower their arms?

**URIANGER:** First explain this other presence in your company. The one I know not. There is but one manner of creature in this world whose aether is suffused with such an abundance of light.

**YSHTOLA:** Mine apologies, Master Matoya, but thou art mistaken. Before thee standeth our dearest comrade. The truest hero among us. Though he is but recently arrived here in the First, not one but *two* Lightwardens have already perished by his most puissant hand. Though she is but recently arrived here in the First, not one but *two* Lightwardens have already perished by her most puissant hand.

**000:** It... It cannot be!

**RUNAR:** What will you say? It's been too long...clearly. Nice to see you too...“Master Matoya.” You truly thought me a sin eater?

**YSHTOLA:** Master Matoya?

**THANCRED:** Lower your weapons. Forgive us this hostile welcome. Come, I would give you a proper introduction to Rak'tika and its people. Slitherbough is the largest of the Blessed's settlements. They worship no gods, instead revering Darkness itself. It is a curious kind of faith, but one which has granted them the strength to persevere in the wake of the Flood. I hope you weren't expecting a grand feast by way of welcome. They are a simple people. Now, I would hear of your travels away from prying ears. Come. I see. And now you seek the Lightwarden of Rak'tika. In the days after I arrived in the First, I too relied upon the Crystal Exarch for guidance. But his penchant for secrecy and the telling of half-truths soon lost him my trust. And thus did I strike out on my own. My work eventually led me here to the forest, which I have come to know like the back of my hand. I cannot say with certainty where your quarry is hiding, but I am confident I can narrow the search.

**YSHTOLA:** Well...go on, then.

**URIANGER:** Some few thousand years ago, this forest stood at the heart of the empire of Ronka. A great many relics of that civilization can still be found to the east in Yx'Maja. Or rather, *could* be found─were the area not fiercely guarded. Yx'Maja, you see, is home to a tribe of warriors whose lineage is said to date back to the time of the empire. Any attempt to enter their territory is met with lethal force. They offer no warnings, and suffer no trespasser to escape. Needless to say, my every attempt to survey the area has been thwarted.

**YSHTOLA:** Mayhap the Warden hideth there full knowing none may approach it for fear of these protectors.

**URIANGER:** As for the tablet... I find the timing of its discovery suspiciously convenient. If I did not know better, I would think someone was trying to curry favor with me. Regardless, it will take time to decipher these writings. Yet I would not be at all surprised if they somehow held the key to entering Yx'Maja unmolested. The Exarch has a nose for serendipity.

**YSHTOLA:** If there is aught I can do to assist thee in unraveling their secrets, thou need'st only ask.

**THANCRED:** Thank you, Urianger. I may well take you up on that offer. While we set to work, might I suggest you take a tour of the city? Should you be in any doubt as to the importance of your role as the “Warrior of Darkness,” the people here will surely cure you of it.

**YSHTOLA:** I must say, Y'shtola...while most of us have struggled to come to terms with our altered circumstances, you seem to have adapted rather well.

**THANCRED:** Lest you forget, Master Matoya and I dedicated our lives to uncovering the truth which hides at the heart of our world. Though separate, the fate of this reflection is nevertheless bound to that of our home. That I would be daunted by such an invaluable opportunity is absurd. But what of you, Thancred? Could it be that you are still struggling to “come to terms” with the nature of your young companion?

**RYNE:** My “struggles” are none of your concern. Quite why you would speak thus─and in *this* company─I do not know. Perhaps you left more of yourself back in the Source than I assumed. If you'll excuse me.

**YSHTOLA:** He understands that I'm not the same. That I'm not her.

**RUNAR:** Understands, perhaps, but does not accept. The question being whether he ever will. And whether *you* will, more importantly. As difficult as your circumstances may be, they are yours, not his. 'Tis you and you alone who bears ultimate responsibility for your life. But you need not make any hard choices now. Why not go and get some fresh air─clear your head? It seemed only right that we show our faces. May we join you?

**YSHTOLA:** Let us begin. I thank you all for coming to pay respects to our fallen daughter of the night. In the light, she was known as Toddia. But in the dark, we shall remember her always as Minnine. Let us each take a moment to offer her our prayers. We entrust her now to the night's sweet embrace. In Darkness will she be free from pain and suffering, now and forevermore. May her soul find peace in the sunless sea of heaven, and in the love we bear for her in our hearts.

**RUNAR:** That vessel represents the night sky. The “sunless sea of heaven.”

**YSHTOLA:** We call upon you now, O Bringer of Shadow, to lead this gentle soul unto the sea. We call upon you, O Warrior of Darkness, to deliver her unto paradise everlasting.

**000:** I am told you assisted in the preparations for the service. On behalf of the Blessed, you have my sincerest thanks. The enduring legend of the Warrior of Darkness owes much to the traditions of these people. And none were more ardent in their faith than Toddia. She would have been greatly moved by your presence.

**RYNE:** What will you say? I should like to have met her. You know I don't deserve such reverence. ...

**THANCRED:** You might not deliver her to the heavens, but if you could deliver the night sky to her people─the *real* night sky─it would be the next best thing. Their prayers would finally be answered. They could gaze up at the firmament and see their ancestors in every twinkle of the stars. We cannot allow their hopes and dreams to drown in the light. We have to bring back the dark. If we don't, who will? Forgive me. Thinking of all those we have lost, I...

**YSHTOLA:** No, it's all right. We *will* bring back the dark.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Mayhap sooner than later, in fact.  Urianger and I have finished deciphering the tablet, and its contents were most illuminating. Let us reconvene in my chambers. We have much to discuss.

**YSHTOLA:** These paintings...they seem familiar. Depictions of heroes throughout history. The age of gods... The empire of Ronka... And this... There was a man. A researcher who pored over these pieces... He offered us work when we needed it. Slaying beasts, delivering provisions... A funny old bugger, he was, but he had a good heart. He believed this first painting dated back to a time of myth and legends. A tribute to the heroes of a long-forgotten era. The story went that it was rediscovered by an explorer from Ronka, who was so struck by its majesty that a second painting was commissioned, commemorating the heroes of their day. "One day, you will all be here too,“ he said. ”Heroes immortalized forever. Maybe I'll paint you myself!“ I had a good laugh at that. We were only trying to make our way, after all. Being heroes couldn't have been further from our minds. But it seems...he actually went and did it. Before or after the Flood, I wonder... Rather faded, isn't it, compared to the others. Or did someone try to scrape it off the wall? Maybe the man himself, once he came to his senses... Do you suppose your deeds will warrant an addition to this collection? Or some other kind of monument?

**RUNAR:** There you are. I have everything I need. Let us quit this place. Is something the matter? We should go. The others are waiting.

**YSHTOLA:** Strange... The others on patrol should have returned by now. Our food will be overcooked if we wait any longer. We will just have to start without them. Would you call Master Matoya and the others?

**URIANGER:** I tire of these games, Urianger. Why do you pretend you cannot see it!? The blessing may spare her the fate of becoming a Lightwarden... But you cannot be blind to the nascent corruption! She is not as she was in the Source. Though I have no proof, I fear that the light which poured forth from the Wardens was not negated at all. I fear it was *absorbed*─that she has been suffused with their light.

**YSHTOLA:** Though I have given thought to this possibility, I dare not speak until more is known.

**PEOPLEOFNIGHTA:** (SIGH) By the time you deign to enlighten us, it may be too late─if it is not already. Urianger─I know full well, after all these years, that you have only the best of intentions. But that does not make it any easier to put my faith in a man so infatuated with secrecy. I have had my suspicions ever since the Exarch bade you speak that day, but now I must ask. The Eighth Umbral Calamity and all that followed; everything you claimed to have seen─did you?

**SYSTEM:** Help! Someone help! The Eulmorans have come for us! We're under attack!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Meanwhile, in Eulmore...

**VAUTHRY:** Lord Vauthry, how good it is to see you. How long has it been? Not since your inauguration, unless I am mistaken? Too long, at any rate. May I say how humbled I am to be invited not only into your city, but your home. You are as generous as ever.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And you as disingenuous. Let us dispense with the pleasantries. This merry band of dissidents people are calling “Warriors of Darkness”... They have slain sin eaters, and by all accounts the Crystarium is complicit in their villainy. And now I hear reports of your people obstructing my soldiers. So I must ask: what exactly do you think you are doing?

**VAUTHRY:** I might ask you the same thing. It should be clear even to you that defeating the Lightwardens represents the world's only hope of survival. Even now, the people of Lakeland and Il Mheg rejoice in the return of night. For a hundred years, they yearned for a means to fight back against the sin eaters and at last they have found one. Yet you choose to stand idly by and do nothing. Why?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Why? Because this “hope” you cling to is nothing more than a fever dream. An exercise in futility. Even should you slay the sin eaters, the world as we know it is beyond salvation. With what little land and resources remain, the people would be free only to starve. Before long they would turn to violence, then to war, and ultimately usher themselves unto oblivion. They require a firm hand to shepherd them from the edge. The hand of a king─nay, a god! I will see their dreams fulfilled, their wishes granted. I will give them peace, order─and they shall never want for bliss. Men are fickle creatures who entertain vague ideals without the faintest notion what they cost. But a little fear can go a long way towards helping them realize what it is they truly need. *Sanctuary*. And they shall find none in this world, save that which *I* afford them. That is why the sin eaters exist. To unite the world under *my* dominion!

**VAUTHRY:** A paradise fit to grace the Eighth Umbral Era.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What was that?

**VAUTHRY:** A minor epiphany, nothing more. You have always held sway over those around you. Those who defy you must submit or die. What sits before me is the inevitable result of bloated privilege and unchecked power. But man is more resilient than you think. His achievements are not the product of violence and bloodshed but compassion and understanding. This calamity is but another crisis to be overcome. And we will─once we eliminate the sin eaters.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** You poor, deluded fool. These people care not for the morrow. They care only for the now, and the contentment they lack. What good is a paradise to them if it is a thousand years in the making? Or even a hundred!?

**VAUTHRY:** You underestimate them, Lord Vauthry. They see further than you think. I have beheld it in the blood and sweat and tears of those who would sacrifice everything for a future they may never know. That their children may never know. I have beheld it in the hopes and dreams of those who came before, which we bequeath to those who come after, that they might in turn build upon the foundations laid by our forebears. *These* are the bonds which hold man and his world together, not your gilded chains─and I will resist your every effort to shackle him.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** In summary, you will continue to support the villains hunting my sin eaters?

**VAUTHRY:** With tremendous enthusiasm, for I have faith in the future they would build.

**RANJIT:** Why do I even bother? Fools, the lot of you! So naive! So *painfully* predictable! Did you imagine I did not know your mind? That I would wait until *after* this meeting to dispatch my forces!? Even as we speak, they march to the sin eaters' defense! Insurrection will not be tolerated! The people of this world are mine to rule, mine to command... And you are no exception! What!? How did he─ Insolent swine! I will not stand for this. Do you hear me!? (SCREAM)

**YSHTOLA:** You speak for the Night's Blessed?

**RANJIT:** I do. I presume *that* is your doing. If you have come to parley, I must insist that you first return him to us.

**YSHTOLA:** You are in no position to make demands. By Lord Vauthry's decree, Rak'tika now falls under the governance of Eulmore. You will henceforth answer to us.

**RANJIT:** Is that so... And the Children of the Everlasting Dark have acquiesced to this madness?

**EVERLASTINGDARKNESS:** We have reached an accord, yes. Too many times have the Night's Blessed shunned Eulmore's overtures of friendship. The risk that you harbor hostile intentions has grown too great to ignore. Therefore his lordship has claimed dominion over this forest, and bestowed executive authority upon the Children of the Everlasting Dark.

**YSHTOLA:** In his wisdom, Lord Vauthry has agreed to recognize ours as the only permissible expression of Dark worship─its one true faith. You and your false creed are a blight on these woods! A foul, unholy corruption that must be cleansed. Little wonder the Warrior of Darkness visits both Lakeland and Il Mheg, yet shuns Rak'tika. Your perverted teachings hold blessed shadow at bay!

**RANJIT:** You have accepted the yoke of Eulmore to spite us, then? Fools. Darkness will never return to these skies while they hold sway.

**RUNAR:** Those of you minded to obey his lordship are to make for Woven Oath with all haste. We will leave you, that you may have time to prepare.

**EVERLASTINGDARKNESS:** Woven Oath!? Are you suggesting we abandon our faith to join those zealots!?

**YSHTOLA:** What has your “faith” afforded you thus far? Nothing! *We* will guide you along the righteous path.

**RANJIT:** And should we refuse?

**YSHTOLA:** Anyone found here upon our return will be considered a traitor to Eulmore, and dealt with as such.

**ALMET:** We will discuss these developments after I have tended to our casualty. 'Twould seem we have found them.

**YSHTOLA:** (-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)You trespass upon sacred ground. Begone!

**UIMET:** Wait! We did not come to─

**YSHTOLA:** (ATTACK GRUNT)

**CYMET:** (BLOCKING GRUNT) Stop! We mean you no harm!

**YSHTOLA:** (-Staff-wielding Sentinel-)Sister. Is that─?

**UIMET:** We are allies of the empire of Ronka. As is customary, we come bearing the seal of the emperor.

**CYMET:** Hmmm... (GASP) (-Spear-wielding Sentinel-)It appears to be genuine!

**ALMET:** (-Staff-wielding Sentinel-)Then perhaps there is yet hope!

**UIMET:** (-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)Perhaps... (-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)We acknowledge your seal, but we must be certain of its authenticity. (-Bow-wielding Sentinel-)Follow the azure flowers to our village. There we will judge if you are friend or foe.

**YSHTOLA:** (-Spear-wielding Sentinel-)Try not to stray from the path, all right?

**ALMET:** "Follow the flowers...“ Would it kill them to escort us? But if it affords us an opportunity to investigate Yx'Maja...fine. It seems to be working!

**UIMET:** (TAKING HIT REAX)

**CYMET:** (TAKING HIT REAX)

**YSHTOLA:** (TAKING HIT REAX)

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** I think not!

**YSHTOLA:** General! Hold on! Hm? (SCREAM)

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** Expertly done.

**RANJIT:** How was I to know that that would happen!? It looked like any other part of the floor! ...Might now be an opportune time to strike a bargain? We poisoned a number of villagers in Slitherbough with a toxin brewed for us by the Children. This is the antidote. I daresay you know how potent their concoctions are─and the futility of trying to counteract their effects. Now, now. Try anything here and we're all likely to fall. Eventually, someone will come to our rescue. Or yours. Promise us safe passage and we'll give you the antidote! Do we have a deal?

**EULMOREADJUTANT:** We do not negotiate with the enemy. The villagers' lives are forfeit. As is yours...

**YSHTOLA:** General?

**RANJIT:** Do not fail.

**RYNE:** How noble. And pointless.

**THANCRED:** Is─is everyone all right? What in the─

**URIANGER:** Urianger!

**THANCRED:** At once!

**RANJIT:** Down with you!

**RYNE:** Guh!

**THANCRED:** Where...where is Y'shtola? Runar. Thank goodness.

**RUNAR:** We delivered the antidote to Slitherbough, and from what we could gather on the way here, the Eulmorans have had the good manners to withdraw. Thank the gods they did, or we would never have made it here in time. I'm told we have Runar and his comrades to thank for keeping the soldiers occupied prior to their retreat. They were preparing to come for you and Y'shtola, it seems, when Runar rallied the villagers and pursued them out of Slitherbough.

**URIANGER:** I must...I-I must... Where...am I?

**RUNAR:** Yx'Maja, in the care of the Viis. Thou art safe now, friend. Pray, rest thee awhile longer.

**000:** No...no, I am all right. Somewhat heavy of limb, perhaps, but otherwise well I assure you. I am glad to see you are all safe. When we realized where the soldiers were headed, we knew something had to be done. I...do not see Master Matoya. She was with you, yes? What happened to her?

**RUNAR:** What will you say? I cannot say for certain─but it was she who secured the antidote. She saved the Night's Blessed─albeit at a cost... ...

**ALMET:** Spare me your riddles and speak plain! Where is Master Matoya!? Well!? Say something! Where is Master Matoya!? No...no... No, that cannot be... Why would she do such a thing? Was there no other way? I...I cannot believe that she...that she... We must begin the search immediately! I will come with you! What are you waiting for? We must find her! She could be trapped or hurt or... She is alive. She is *alive*, damn you!

**THANCRED:** Forgive me for interrupting, but our scouts have apprehended an intruder. We thought perhaps he might be an associate of yours...

**EMETSELCH:** Oh, look who it is.

**THANCRED:** Well...this is embarrassing. In my defense, they are surprisingly tenacious. So─what trouble have you gotten yourselves into this time? Well, well. What an intriguing turn of events. My condolences, by the way. 'Tis never easy to lose the ones we love. Well, she is dead, isn't she? Wishing it were otherwise will not make it so.

**RYNE:** That *you* should be indifferent to her loss is no surprise. But to us, she was a friend. The best of friends.

**000:** You have something on your mind. What is it?

**URIANGER:** What will you say? I'm beginning to wonder what really happened when she fell. After she fell, there was a powerful gust of wind as if from nowhere...

**THANCRED:** Pray recount to us again that which thou witnessed in the ruins, omitting not the slightest detail.

**EMETSELCH:** Flow... The teleportation magick she used to spirit us away from Ul'dah after the bloody banquet! I recall a similar gale in the tunnel before it took effect.

**URIANGER:** Interesting. I thought I sensed a brief disturbance in the Lifestream. How reassuring to know it was not my imagination. I felt it only once, I should mention. Which would suggest she is still adrift on its currents.

**EMETSELCH:** Then I fear she may yet be lost to us─for it was only by the grace of the elementals that she was plucked from that great aetherial river.

**RUNAR:** Oh...very well. I'll go and fetch her... Perhaps a clear and unambiguous act of kindness will serve to win the trust you seem so determined to deny me. Yes, this place should serve well enough. Might I have a little space? I *need* to concentrate. Now then...what color was her soul again? Ah... There you are.

**YSHTOLA:** He─He's done it! He's brought her back!

**THANCRED:** (WAKING UP REAX)

**YSHTOLA:** Y'shtola, are you all right?

**URIANGER:** Yes... Though I cannot imagine how. What happened?

**YSHTOLA:** Thou didst invoke the power of Flow, which thence did usher thy soul unto the Lifestream.

**RUNAR:** I wanted to save the antidote, and after that... (SUDDEN LAUGH) I did something exceedingly reckless. For which you will just have to forgive me. (SHOCK REAX)

**YSHTOLA:** Master Matoya! Oh, thank the heavens you're all right! I had nearly given up hope.

**EMETSELCH:** Please, Runar, dry your tears. What would the others think if they saw you like this? Come now─did you really think I would go gently into that dark night with so much left undone? So many mysteries left unsolved?

**URIANGER:** Ahem. Is there aught you wish to say to me? A word of *thanks*, perhaps?

**YSHTOLA:** Emet-Selch, the Ascian of whom I spoke. 'Twas he who plucked thee from the Lifestream.

**000:** I see. Thank you. Differences notwithstanding, you saved my life, and for that I am grateful. But let us turn our attention to more important matters, such as the Qitana Ravel. You had better not have explored its depths without me.

**THANCRED:** What will you say? Heavens no. In fact, I was awaiting your return. I wouldn't have known where to start. I'll tell you after you've got some rest.

**RYNE:** Well. Almet and the others should be pleased to see you in such *uncharacteristically* high spirits. Let us return to Fanow, then, and discuss the coming expedition.

**THANCRED:** The Lightwarden is dead. The Blessed's prayers have been answered...

**URIANGER:** Aye, that they have.

**YSHTOLA:** His condition yet troubleth thee? Her condition yet troubleth thee?

**URIANGER:** It does. Though she shows no immediate signs of corruption, the danger remains. She must be told. ...Would you describe it to me, Urianger? Paint for me a picture with your words.

**YSHTOLA:** A sea of shimmering stars. Diamonds strewn across a raven gown, boundless and beautiful. 'Tis an exquisite sight not unlike that of the Source. Calm and gentle...and forgiving...

**URIANGER:** I can see it...

**YSHTOLA:** For however deep the void, or wide the expanse, there is no shore so distant as to be beyond the reach of light. ...Ominous though that may sound, given our present travails.

**RYNE:** Well fought. Let us return home. The murals. If I am not mistaken, they predate the empire.

**YSHTOLA:** How can you tell?

**EMETSELCH:** A peculiarity of the paint. Most are made from mineral-based pigments, but whatever was used here is older than anything I have ever seen. According to Almet, this sanctuary was built to preserve the wisdom of the ancients. What events do these murals commemorate, I wonder?

**THANCRED:** Must you always linger after defeating your enemies? Navigating these halls on foot is exhausting.

**EMETSELCH:** Come to lead us to safety, have you?

**YSHTOLA:** Hmph! I was *bored*. But how is the hero of the hour? Hmm. Fighting fit, I see. Keep up the good work.

**EMETSELCH:** You're plotting something.

**RYNE:** Every hour of every day. But never you mind about that. As I have told you a thousand times before: I like to watch. Nothing more. Well! I would quit this place, and I suggest you do the same. There is yet work to be done. Ah...there is a sight to bring a tear to the eye.

**EMETSELCH:** You recognize these scenes?

**YSHTOLA:** That I do. Indeed, there was a time when anyone and everyone would. Until one calamitous day when the world was divided across ten and three reflections, sundering the land and all who dwelled upon it. And the worst part? No one could remember it. Not really. Just fragments and fleeting memories of an achingly familiar world... A vision shared of a paradise lost, preserved only in song and scripture and paint... Once upon a time. Yet here we find ourselves again. To look, learn, and *remember*...

**EMETSELCH:** Then share with us the stories you know so well. We are listening.

**YSHTOLA:** Before the great sundering, there was one world. A world that knew naught but peace and prosperity. Until it was faced with a crisis. Unprecedented, terrifying. Civilization found itself perched upon a precipice, staring into oblivion. But through prayer and sacrifice, the will of the star was made manifest. Zodiark was His name, and by His grace was the calamity averted.

**EMETSELCH:** Zodiark!?

**THANCRED:** A savior mighty and magnificent, deserving of reverence and gratitude...one would have thought. Yet some thought otherwise. From the fears of these naysayers would rise Hydaelyn─She who was to serve as His shackles. To bind Him and hold Him in check. And so they fought, and they fought, and they fought. And in the end...Hydaelyn was victorious. With all Her strength She smote Him─dealing a blow so devastating that it split the very fabric of reality. And thus was Zodiark banished and His being divided. That concludes today's lesson on long-forgotten history. Though I imagine your Mother would offer a rather contradictory account. As is Her wont.

**EMETSELCH:** I'm sorry─I can only assume I misheard, but it sounded an awful lot like you were implying both Zodiark and Hydaelyn are not gods, but─

**YSHTOLA:** What? Not gods of the First? Is that what you thought these paintings depicted? Or...? Oh! Ohhh... They are gods after a fashion, yes, but no different from the kind with which you are so intimately acquainted. Formed of faith and prayer, of conviction and devotion... The eldest and most powerful...of primals.

**EMETSELCH:** You have spun quite a tale. Yet you have not explained the role of the Ascians in all of this. How is it you are privy to ancient secrets lost to time?

**RUNAR:** (LAUGH) Finally, *finally*, you ask the right question! And shrewd questions warrant honest answers... We Ascians know because it is our history. Our story. It was we who summoned Zodiark─we natives of that sundered paradise. Now do you see why we yearn for the Great Rejoining? For our world...for our people...for all creation to be made whole again. Wouldn't you wish for the same?

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, you are returned! And none the worse for wear, I see.

**RUNAR:** You needn't worry about us. What became of the Eulmoran soldiers, more importantly?

**YSHTOLA:** They turned tail and fled at the sight of the night sky. The Children of the Everlasting Dark have also retreated back to Woven Oath. Try as they might, they could not deny the truth of their own eyes... The sunless sea of heaven, full of love and grace, where none need know pain or suffering. In that moment, when the sky's light began to wane, I knew our prayers had been answered. ...That we were doomed to face oblivion at life's end no longer. When first we met, I harbored certain suspicions about you. Now I see that I was right. You are the Bringers of Shadow. The Warriors of Darkness. The saviors for whom we have prayed for so long.

**RUNAR:** I suppose you're not entirely wrong... But we are not worthy of your reverence, nor have we any desire to be worshipped. If you would pray, pray for your children, that they may one day know a better world.

**YSHTOLA:** ...I will do as you say. But please, let us at least hold a feast to celebrate your victory. You deserve that much.

**RUNAR:** I am sorry, Runar, but there is still much to be done, and scant time in which to do it. We must go─all of us. For we share the same path and the same fate.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** So be it. I ask only that you hold us in your hearts, as we will hold you in ours, now and ever after. By the boundless dark, this I swear.

**000:** So there's a light sealed inside you, is there? You wouldn't know it from the outside. You look the same as you ever did to me.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? I must stay the course. For the others. And what if that changes? What if it overwhelms me? Then I suppose there's naught to do but rest.

**SYSTEM:** True enough. Packing up and going home isn't really an option, is it. If you don't face the music here, it'll only come and find you there. Damned if I know. It's not as if I can lift a finger to help myself, much less you. Have faith in your friends. Look out for them, and hope that they look out for you. What more can you do? Ah, yes. If they're not asking you to fight they're telling you to rest. Which isn't to say they're wrong. You'll need your strength for what's to come. ...Think he was telling the truth? Emet, I mean. All that rot about Hydaelyn being no different from any other primal... If so, what would that make Her “blessing”? Are we just slaves to Her will? Ahh─let's pay him no mind. Lies are the Ascians' stock-in-trade. Villains, heroes─all a matter of perspective, they'd have you believe. One man's fond memory another's waking nightmare... Me, I'm no saint or savior─just another sinner. And I know damn well I'm in no position to judge... When I saw the people of Slitherbough look up at the sky and celebrate the return of the dark...felt good. It was moments like that that I cherished─much more than the thrill of adventure. The quiet after the storm. I always took comfort in that.

**ESTINIEN:** Meanwhile, in Garlemald...

**SHADOWHUNTER:** What did the scouts have to report?

**ESTINIEN:** Several skirmishes, but nothing of consequence. The fighting seems to have taken its toll on both sides.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** A stalemate, then. The Alliance has done well to hold the line for so long. ...But then they did have Ishgardian reinforcements.

**ESTINIEN:** Nevertheless, neither side has any appetite for a prolonged engagement. 'Tis but the calm before the storm. And should the Empire choose to bring their full might to bear...

**SHADOWHUNTER:** To say nothing of Black Rose. All the more reason to hasten our search. How close are your people to identifying our next target?

**ESTINIEN:** Close enough. Though I have received some troubling intelligence. One of our generals posted to the Ala Mhigan front recently disappeared without trace from the battlefield at the Ghimlyt Dark.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Odd. Dead seems unlikely, fled less so. I wonder where he'll turn up...

**ESTINIEN:** Were I a betting man, I would say *here*─in the capital. Not that any deserter who valued his life would contemplate returning. But a corpse might, given the right encouragement.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** In the manner of His Royal Remains, you mean?

**ZENOS:** Elidibus plainly has no need of a new host, so the question becomes, who? It may be that another player has joined the game. Something to consider, at any rate. But come, there is work to be done.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Distressed Townsman-)Sin eaters sighted! They're coming!

**ALISAIE:** Excellent. The barrier is holding.

**ALPHINAUD:** That's good news for the Crystarium, but what of the rest of Lakeland?

**RYNE:** Lyna and the city guard have taken to the field. Thancred and the others have already joined them. Let us do the same.

**LYNA:** There are so many...

**RYNE:** Godsdammit!

**LYNA:** Lyna! (ATTACK GRUNT) Lyna, hold on!

**THANCRED:** They...they turned on me...

**RYNE:** (COUGHING BLOOD)

**THANCRED:** Thancred!

**CRYSTARIUMGARDYOUNG:** This...one...is mine!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** We need only hold out a little while longer. Reinforcements are coming, remember? The captain said so. We're going to be all right...

**CRYSTARIUMGARDYOUNG:** Run! Run, damn you!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** The Warrior of Darkness has returned. The bloody *night* has returned! So stay with me, eh? You can't go dying now!

**CRYSTARIUMGARDYOUNG:** Godsdammit! Please let this work, *please* let this work... (WHIFF GRUNT)

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** No! N-No, stay back! Stay back! Help, help! Someone, anyone!

**CRYSTARIUMGARDOLD:** Why did you spare *me*? Why? What have I done to deserve this *mercy*!?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Forward! *Forward*! If you can still hold a sword, follow me! Wounded, to the rear! Weapons at the ready! Let's make this count!

**LYNA:** Fight and struggle. Seek salvation by your own hands. Though the losses be grave, endure them. Though the victories be hollow, claim them.

**000:** Oh. I did not see you there. Is there something you need?

**LYNA:** What will you say? No, no, I'm fine. How are you feeling? Shouldn't you be resting? What would the guard do without their captain?

**VAUTHRY:** Injuries are part and parcel of battle. While there's breath in my lungs, I shall see my duties done. ...Appoint another. A captain's place is with her soldiers in the field. Don't pretend you are not of the same mind. You fought well today. Saved a great many lives. Thank you. Unfortunately, this war is far from over. We must replenish our ranks and shore up our defenses before they attack again. Now, if you will excuse me. (FALLING TO GROUND REAX) I...am fine... Completely...and utterly...fine! Better than fine! Hale and hearty and still alive to mourn those who are not. Who I failed to protect when they needed me most. We've come so far─so *godsdamned* far! I could have sworn the end was in sight. And now... Now they will never see it.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Vauthry-)Impudent worms of the Crystarium. (-Vauthry-)The tragedy that has befallen you is of your own making. Divine retribution for your defiance. (-Vauthry-)The heavens have bequeathed to you a benevolent savior─me! I offer you freedom from pain and suffering─a paradise where man and sin eater might live in peace and harmony... (-Vauthry-)Why, already our winged brothers and sisters regard me and mine as kin, alike to them in beauty and purity! (-Vauthry-)But you─you not only reject my proffered hand, but raise your own against my sin eaters. 'Tis only right that they respond in kind. (-Vauthry-)Let this be a lesson to all those who would walk the path of sin─the wicked shall not inherit this world!

**EMETSELCH:** My friends. With your aid we have weathered a brutal assault...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Sorry I'm late. Though I would not have been had anyone thought to notify me in advance.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...As I was saying, it was only with your aid that we weathered this assault. Without it, the Crystarium and all who dwell here would now be gone.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** For each we saved, another perished. If there is anything else we can do to help─anything at all─you need only ask. This is our home too, and we want nothing more than to keep it safe.

**URIANGER:** Thank you. We are blessed to have you with us. As for the attack itself─Vauthry may call it divine retribution, but sin eaters are creatures of instinct. A coordinated assault is unprecedented. Moreover, in the absence of a Lightwarden, there should have been no compulsion for lesser sin eaters to congregate here en masse. All of which points to a single, unavoidable conclusion...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...That these minions of light answer to a higher power. He who did claim kinship with them─who did boast of control, not in idleness, 'twould seem, but in earnest. Lord Vauthry.

**ALISAIE:** Indeed. What I mistook for bluster was in fact the truth. The sin eaters are his to command. But if he imagines this show of force will convince us to bend the knee, he is sorely mistaken.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I take it your meeting in Eulmore did *not* end well?

**ALPHINAUD:** You could say that, yes. But I am wiser for the experience, nevertheless. It appears he has mastered a technique which allows him to enslave the minds of others. A fact I discovered when he attempted to use it on me.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** That would go some way towards explaining the peculiar reverence afforded him by his subjects. There may feasibly be a handful of true believers among them, I suppose, but it would not surprise me if the vast majority were in his thrall.

**ALISAIE:** Had I not anticipated his treachery, I might well have joined them. But seeing his invitation for what it was, I sent a glamour in my stead. I rather doubt such tricks will avail me a second time, however.

**ALPHINAUD:** Did you have any luck tracking down the Lightwarden in Kholusia?

**ALISAIE:** Sadly, I have nothing to report on that front. What of Amh Araeng?

**YSHTOLA:** After a fruitless few days scouring ruins, I resorted to asking the locals. While no one I spoke to had seen any sign of the Warden, I did uncover a possible lead: an abandoned mine in western Amh Araeng. From what the Mord told me, it would be a perfect place to stay out of sight. Of course, I could never hope to explore such a labyrinth quickly or safely on my own, so I returned here.

**RYNE:** Even should we all join in the endeavor, an exhaustive search could take weeks─and with no guarantee of finding anything.

**THANCRED:** The Wardens harbor vast reservoirs of primordial Light, do they not? Far beyond anything found in lesser sin eaters. And isn't it true that the Oracle could see the Light of a sin eater from malms away? Surely a Warden would seem like a blazing beacon by comparison? To the real Oracle of Light, I mean. The real Minfilia. If we traveled to Amh Araeng, to the south where she halted the Flood, I could summon her back. What do you think?

**RYNE:** ...Don't.

**THANCRED:** Don't what? Do what I can? What we both know is right!?

**RYNE:** Do not presume to know my mind. You have no idea what you're proposing.

**EMETSELCH:** But I do! I know why you never said anything. Because you thought you could keep me safe by keeping me in the dark. And...maybe I thought so too. But I knew, Thancred. I always knew!

**THANCRED:** Oh, I see... I thought you were a rather underwhelming reincarnation, but it all makes sense now. The Oracle lies dormant within you, doesn't she? But to draw on her true power, you must become one, both body and soul. To wit, one being must consume the other. Who shall be the lucky winner?

**EMETSELCH:** This doesn't concern you, Ascian.

**THANCRED:** But it plainly concerns you. Which is why your heart is ready to burst out of your chest. Despite the raging tempest in your bosom, however, you have never once opened up to your young charge. Now why would that be? Love...? Well, I for one think it's a marvelous idea. Certainly more promising than any of your other suggestions. So─it's off to Amh Araeng we go!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** I'll meet you at the gates.

**THAFFE:** Take comfort in the bonds you share. Accept the pain when the time comes to part. Press on, for joy and sorrow walk hand in hand. Beyond Mount Garik lie the Hills of Amber, beneath which run hidden veins of mineral wealth. Or *ran*, at least. Mayhap they are spent. Or mayhap the ringing of hammers *can* yet be heard below...

**THANCRED:** Magnus's wife was a miner, you know. Greatest prospector there ever was. When the golem hearts started failing, she was the first to head out in search of more. Problem was, most of the veins ran dry ages ago, and finding fresh ones to tap's only gotten harder. But she wasn't one to be deterred. She just kept digging deeper and deeper. And then the mine collapsed. We labored day and night to clear away the rubble, but it took us two months to find her... ...To find her body. Magnus has never been the same since.

**THAFFE:** Where is he, if you don't mind my asking?

**MAGNUS:** Ah, yes, well...if he's not here, there's only one other place he'd be.

**THANCRED:** What? Oh... You again. How many times must I tell you─the trolley won't run! We'd be better off dismantling the damn thing and selling the parts for scrap. Now piss off back to wherever you came from, and don't let me catch you around here again.

**MAGNUS:** ...What were their names?

**THANCRED:** My son was named Skuli. My wife, Agna. Being here with them...it beats going home. Home stopped being home when I lost them. I thought to try and drown my sorrows...but somehow...the bottle's never deep enough.

**MAGNUS:** No bottle is. Believe me─I know.

**THANCRED:** You've lost someone too?

**MAGNUS:** Not like you. Not my own flesh and blood. I grew up an orphan, so I never really knew what family meant. Not until I met a man who offered to take me in and make me his pupil. He was a kindly soul. Always looking out for me, like a father. Not that I appreciated that at the time, or anything else for that matter... But I finally had a family. And then...and then I robbed a young girl of hers. I did my best to make amends, to offer her comfort. But the more I look back on it, the more I realize just how inadequate my efforts were. I let her down. That is why I refuse to let her legacy die. In the end, all we can do is press on. For those we have lost. For those we can yet save. And that requires your Talos. Please, Magnus. You are our only hope of reaching Nabaath Areng.

**RYNE:** ...What rubbish.

**THANCRED:** She's not gone. No matter what you say or believe, she's not. We can still bring her back.

**000:** You may not remember this about our Minfilia... But prior to founding the Path of the Twelve, long before the Scions, she was something of a miner. After her father died, F'lhaminn took her in and taught her the trade. I think they were both seeking to fill the void left by a loved one. Maybe that's why she took to it so readily. Back in those days, I spent most of my time in the Quicksand or some other tavern, loosening tongues and gathering secrets. Occasionally, I'd catch a glimpse of her in the street, on her way home after another hard day's work. I always felt a wave of relief when I saw she'd come back safe...along with a pang of guilt at the fact I wasn't there to support her as I should've been. Simply speaking with her more than once in a blue moon would've been a good start, but I could never bring myself to do it. Instead, I threw myself into my “work” and became every drunkard's best friend.

**THANCRED:** What will you say? I can't imagine she thought too highly of you back then. Not your finest hour, to say the least.

**GUTHJON:** Not too highly, no. She once called me a “wine-sodden wharf rat”─which wouldn't have been half as galling had it not been so accurate. Far from it─and F'lhaminn has never let me live it down. But that was a lifetime ago. Here and now I have another chance to do things right, and I will *not* squander it again.

**THANCRED:** Hey! Come and see what I've found! You're not going to believe this!

**GUTHJON:** Tell me it's leonine.

**THANCRED:** It is, at that! You lot were born lucky. It's mostly broken pieces─but look at this!

**GUTHJON:** This is a rather fine specimen.

**THANCRED:** It's been decades since we've found anything approaching this big! But that's not all─there's an engraving on it.

**GUTHJON:** Ah, these scratches here? They're a little hard to make out. "To my beloved Magnus and Skuli.“

**URIANGER:** Yes! Do you see!? It was a gift to Magnus from his wife! She found it. She *really* found it. She must've spent her final hours carving this message into the stone, in the hope that he might see it one day. Those rock-backed bastards must've made off with it before we could clear a path to her. It's fate that brought you here to find this stone. No other explanation. Makes me wonder what else might still be buried in these parts.

**THAFFE:** Preparations for the enchantment are complete. When the heart hath been suffused with a sufficient quantity of aether, the golem should be restored to life.

**MAGNUS:** All right then. Whenever you're ready. It's working! It's working! M...Magnus.

**URIANGER:** You left me for this...this wretched heap of stone and rubble... This worthless pile of earth. And yet...I can't... I can't...

**RYNE:** What troubleth thee, child?

**URIANGER:** I shouldn't be here. I don't deserve to be. I don't deserve any of the things you've done for me! I'm just a burden, helpless and hopeless. If tomorrow came and I was gone, it would be better for everyone! Thancred most of all. He'll never admit it, but I can see it in his eyes... I wish he'd just say it─just say that he hates me! That he wishes I was dead so that she could return...

**000:** None of this is thy doing, child. 'Twas *I* who set the Oracle on her path unto the First. *I* who condemned you all to suffer these torments. 'Tis my sin alone, and one that will haunt me unto my dying day. Yet I dare not dwell overlong on my many regrets, for the world is a tapestry of fates, interwoven and inseparable, and we who strive to better it cannot choose but make difficult decisions. For naught of worth was ever achieved without sacrifice. And thus must man ever struggle to weigh life against loss. The one for whom thou mournest beareth no grudge. Were she here, she would not suffer thee to languish in sorrow. She would tell thee to seek thine own path, thine own purpose. It is a truth which I myself was slow to learn. Yet a truth it remaineth. Thou needst but have faith. Have faith and all will be well.

**THANCRED:** What will you say? Go to her. Have you no words for her?

**SYSTEM:** Not today.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Meanwhile, in the Crystarium...

**EMETSELCH:** To what do I owe the pleasure that is your extended stay?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Oh, to the tediousness of our heroes' present endeavors. That, and the insufferable abundance of Light in Amh Araeng. I should be glad to keep my distance. I'm rather fond of sleep, you know. Wonderful way to pass the time. Not that my compeers would agree, mind you. Always on the move, the lot of them. Like Lahabrea, constantly jumping from vessel to vessel. Such fire, such determination! So much passion, fleeting and forgotten... Come to think of it, Exarch, I don't believe I've ever seen *you* retire to your chambers for so much as forty winks. However do you keep your eyes from closing? The cold shoulder. You wound me, sir. Always so guarded in our every interaction─interactions you curiously refrain from sharing with the Scions and their champion...

**EMETSELCH:** And risk souring your budding relationship? I think not. Much as I dislike you, there are more useful targets for his energies. And I am not in the habit of pointing him at my enemies like a weapon. And risk souring your budding relationship? I think not. Much as I dislike you, there are more useful targets for her energies. And I am not in the habit of pointing her at my enemies like a weapon.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Is that right? Fond of her, are you? You continue to fascinate me, Exarch. But tell me: who are you? The once-great nation whose ingenuity gave birth to this tower was shaped by my hand. As such, I know full well the wonders it can facilitate...and those it cannot. There is nothing in these walls which could have aided you in summoning our dear friend across time and space. Much less in possession of her mortal flesh! Not even *I* could have performed such a feat.

**EMETSELCH:** I see... You had a hand in Allag as well. You would know what I am? I am the adjudicator of the sacred history with which you dared trifle. I am keeper of this tower's boundless wisdom. The wisdom of ages without age. Of everywhere and nowhere. The great work of those who tamed the wings of time, and grasped the nature of the rift. 'Tis a boon born of the sacrifice of brave heroes who gave their lives for a brighter future. 'Tis a boon born of sacrifices yet unmade... The parting gift of brave heroes who will one day give their lives for a brighter future. I will not see their hopes and dreams squandered. The history which led us here *will* be unwritten. I promise you that.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Well, it seems we are both eager to fulfill our duties, then.

**RYNE:** On that much we are in agreement.

**URIANGER:** Urianger?

**THANCRED:** Thou must needs carry on without me. The path to Nabaath Areng lieth open. Whilst thou travelest thither to the south, I would apprise Mistress Alisaie and the others of our progress. As circumstances permit, I will thereafter rejoin the hunt for the remaining Lightwardens.

**MAGNUS:** Magnus. Will the gate close immediately after the trolley passes through?

**THANCRED:** No, it will stay open until someone closes it manually. Built that way to prevent any untimely accidents.

**RYNE:** Then you and the others can meet us in Nabaath Areng after giving the Eulmorans the slip.

**URIANGER:** Ah, Urianger... Thank you. For everything.

**MAGNUS:** Remember: thou needst but have faith.

**THANCRED:** If you've finished with your good-byes, I suggest you grab hold of something. Be a shame if you took a tumble. The tracks beyond the gate aren't in the best of shape, so the trolley can only go as far as Amh Malik. Godsspeed!

**RANJIT:** Ah, that must be the gate. Well, so far so good... Wait...is that─ *Ran'jit*!

**THANCRED:** (ATTACK GRUNT)

**RYNE:** (IMPACT GRUNT)

**THANCRED:** (IMPACT GRUNT)

**RANJIT:** You're a stubborn old swine, aren't you...

**RYNE:** One who has mastered Gukumatz fears not the blackest pit or the fieriest hell. Your deeds in the east did not go unnoticed. Long have I lain in wait, and sure enough, you did not disappoint. Had you only sworn fealty to Lord Vauthry, you would have no cause to skulk about like frightened animals.

**RANJIT:** (STRUGGLING TO RISE GRUNT)

**RYNE:** You will remain as you are, while I dispatch these villains.

**RANJIT:** No! I won't...! I won't let you!

**RYNE:** You forget to whom you speak! Who armed you? Trained you? Fought and killed a thousand sin eaters with you!? And when you were inevitably cut down and lay lifeless in my arms─who sought out your successor to carry on the futile struggle again and again!? We seek to bring peace to what is left of this shattered land, while these mad fools would only bring further chaos down upon us! Do not be deceived, child! Only by Lord Vauthry's hand will this dying world know a sliver of salvation!

**RANJIT:** I don't know about the world...but I never asked to be saved. However much it hurts, and however hard it gets, it's my life, and I want to live it on my own terms! And those “mad fools” you want me to abandon? The ones I've traveled with, fought with, and may one day die with─they feel the same. So no, I will *not* be deceived! No matter what you say, I refuse to believe it's all for nothing! They're everything to me. All I have and all I need. And I would gladly do anything for them. Let us pass, or kill me. I'm not leaving here without them.

**THANCRED:** How *dare* you! Very well─if you would cast your lot with villains, then you shall share their fate! (ATTACK GRUNT)

**RYNE:** I heard what you said. And I'm sorry for all the things I've left unspoken. You have to go. Now!

**THANCRED:** Thancred, no─

**RANJIT:** Go! Do what you came here to do. I'll not have you waste that newfound resolve on me. I leave her in your hands. Hurry! Not another step! Your fight is with me.

**THANCRED:** You think yourself her protector!? Hah! As if a whelp like you could be a better father to her than me! You would have her suffer and die. I would spare her that fate!

**RYNE:** That is not for you or anyone else to decide─ever again. (PANTING) Not a single day goes by that I don't think about all that you have given me. Countless memories and moments I took for granted... Gods, you grew up so fast. But you had to, didn't you? For those you had lost. For those you could yet save. A world teetering on the very brink of oblivion, for which you gave your everything without hesitation... Your kindness, your compassion, your love... Then and now... One last time, with a little help. I'm so proud to have been a part of your life... Oh, Minfilia...

**NABAATHARENGPEOPLEA:** Is this─

**NABAATHARENGPEOPLEB:** Run for your lives! It's the Flood! The Flood!

**NABAATHARENGPEOPLEC:** (SCREAMING)

**NABAATHARENGPEOPLED:** The end is nigh!

**MINFILIA:** Look! Th-There's somebody up there! On top of the palace!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** (EFFORT GRUNT) No. Stand back. We shall stay the Flood.

**MINFILIA:** But this is what I want! It's my sacrifice to make!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Your time has not yet come. When all hangs in the balance, *you* must give them hope.

**RYNE:** Minfilia!

**MINFILIA:** This place... You... You're...

**000:** Ours is a meeting long overdue. Full glad am I that we may finally speak.

**MINFILIA:** What will you say? It's good to see you again. I've come at Thancred's behest. ...

**RYNE:** My dear, sweet child... Yours is a burden none should ever be forced to bear. Such pain and suffering you have endured, yet still you came. For this and more, I thank you.

**MINFILIA:** I've lost count of the times I've almost given up. If people hadn't helped me every step of the way, I never would have made it.

**RYNE:** Yet here you stand, resolved. Now...tell me your heart's desire.

**MINFILIA:** To defeat the sin eaters, and bring this world back from the brink! The remaining Wardens have hidden themselves from us. But with the power of the Oracle, I thought we might be able to find them...

**RYNE:** Indeed you could. Their radiance would be unmistakable. But know, my child, that the power you seek will come at a price. We stand now at the crossroads. A decision must be made. 'Tis only natural to be afraid. To hesitate. But for your many trials, you have grown stronger and wiser. And with the love and support of those you hold dear, you have grown to love yourself.

**MINFILIA:** The Flood has washed away so much of this world. So many people and places and possibilities─and all the heroes who fought to protect them. Yet here the Scions are, trying so, so hard to help those few of us who remain. And seeing how tirelessly they work, how completely committed they are to the cause...I can't help but believe. But I want to do more than just watch and cheer. I want to make a difference. I want to help them, like they helped me─and maybe even inspire others to do the same. Coming together, providing for one another─that's the only way forward I can see. Since all of our heroes are gone, we'll just have to make heroes of ourselves.

**RYNE:** 'Tis a beautiful, wonderful dream. One we share. Though my power was all but spent in staying the Flood, I prayed this final act would give hope to those who survived. That selfsame hope lives on in you. It gives me comfort to know that the future is in capable hands. If ever you should falter, remember this: no one, however powerful, is immune to the whisperings of doubt and despair. Do not give in to them, but do not deny them either. Look instead to the light within, that you may continue to serve as a beacon to others.

**MINFILIA:** Thank you, Minfilia, for believing in us. For believing in me.

**THANCRED:** Dearest friend...no words can express my gratitude to you for keeping her safe in these tumultuous times. You are a hero to us both. But not even the most valiant heroes can stand alone. Only *together* may you change the fate of two worlds.

**ALISAIE:** Ah, there you are. We were worried.

**THANCRED:** Really? She wasn't the one that nearly got herself killed. It's a good thing Urianger called on us when he did. You were at death's door when we found you.

**ALPHINAUD:** But thanks to your timely ministrations, I was not obliged to walk through it.

**THANCRED:** Minfilia...?

**RYNE:** You saw her.

**THANCRED:** (-Minfilia-)I know I haven't exactly been pulling my weight up till now, but that's all going to change, starting today. (-Minfilia-)I'll do whatever it takes─whatever it takes to make Minfilia's dream a reality. (-Minfilia-)I can track the Lightwardens now. Maybe even help you fight them.

**RYNE:** I'm glad you're back.

**THANCRED:** (-Minfilia-)You don't have to say that, you know...

**YSHTOLA:** But I want to. You're family. How else would I feel?

**ALPHINAUD:** She will need a name.

**YSHTOLA:** A name?

**ALISAIE:** A name of her own. I would not have her walk in the shadow of another any longer. And I think it a fitting tribute to our departed friend too. At the mention of Minfilia, I would remember the woman who preserved our fellowship when all seemed lost.

**RYNE:** Do you remember what you were called before you were taken to Eulmore?

**YSHTOLA:** (-Minfilia-)I'm sorry, I don't. I couldn't have been very old when it happened.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then we must think of a new name. Suggestions?

**ALISAIE:** If the lady herself has no preference, I think the honor should rightly fall to Thancred. After all they have been through together, he's practically a father to her.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well spotted! I'm so glad you're here to explain these things.

**ALISAIE:** And what exactly is that supposed to mean?

**THANCRED:** Oh, nothing...

**URIANGER:** What about... Ryne?

**THANCRED:** Ah. “Blessing” in Fae... Wait! Doth this mean thou wert *listening* when I delivered my lectures on the pixies?

**RYNE:** Not exactly. But that one word made an impression. Of course, if it's not to your liking, I can think of something else.

**THANCRED:** Ryne... Yes, I rather like the sound of it. Thank you.

**RYNE:** That settles it, then. Welcome aboard, Ryne!

**THAFFE:** I won't let you down.

**MAGNUS:** Don't get me wrong, I'm glad those travelers made it all the way to Nabaath Areng... But when Urianger told me the Talos was in pieces, and the trolley didn't look much better, I couldn't help wondering what in the hells had gone on.

**THAFFE:** What indeed. At least the heart is in one piece. The rest is replaceable. Looking at this mess, though, it's a miracle they survived...

**MAGNUS:** Heh, you can say that again. Wha─ What the!? Are you seeing this!?

**ALISAIE:** The sky, it's... It...

**ALPHINAUD:** At last. Night has returned to Amh Araeng. We'll save this broken world yet, Tesleen. You see if we don't...

**YSHTOLA:** No doubt retreating in the wake of the Warden's demise.

**THANCRED:** Back to Kholusia. The last refuge of Light.

**ALPHINAUD:** Home to our dear Lord Vauthry─who will no doubt do everything in his power to thwart us.

**000:** As well he should, for defeat there would spell the end for both him and his heavenly host. There the fate of this star shall be decided.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? So this is where you've been hiding. Why did you stay behind?

**000:** Sometimes the dead would rather not be disturbed. But enough about me─what of Amh Araeng? I see. Minfilia's gone, then. Which means the reason I must suffer this purgatory shall forever remain a mystery. What's the matter? Are you all right? Ah! What...what just happened?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? There...there was something Minfilia said to me... Not even the most valiant heroes can stand alone...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Minfilia said my time had not yet come. That I still had a role to play. Not even the most valiant heroes can stand alone... No─ No, it couldn't be. There's only one hero in this room, and it is *not* me. I'm just a shadow, cursed to wander.

**000:** Ahem. Forgive the intrusion, but Minfilia─that is, Ryne and the others were asking after you. Is everything all right? That pain again? And did it pass? Thank goodness for that. I would not wish to see you suffer. Though I know only too well how much you have suffered on our behalf in recent days. Indeed, I have no right to impose upon you further. Nevertheless, I must ask one thing of you. That you survive this, no matter what. When the dust settles, you *must* return to your world. For the battles to come and the wars yet unwon. The final Lightwarden is all that stands between us and victory. There is still much we must do to prepare, but for now, I will see if there is aught that may remedy the strange affliction which plagues you.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? I'll see it through. The end is finally in sight. When the Warden is dead, will your work finally be done?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALISAIE:** Ah, there you are. May I assume you've had your fill of rest? That is well. Now that we are all present, let us speak of our plan. Thus far, we have vanquished four Lightwardens, restoring night to much of Norvrandt. Only one remains─that of Kholusia. And with Ryne to guide us, I am certain we will find it.

**ALPHINAUD:** We're so close now. If we can just take care of this one last Warden, we'll rob the sin eaters of their final foothold, and drive them out of Norvrandt once and for all. It will be a new beginning for the First─a chance for the people to rebuild their world.

**URIANGER:** In short, a prize worth fighting for.

**YSHTOLA:** And in thus delivering the First from destruction, so too shall we unsow the seeds of the Eighth Umbral Calamity.

**EMETSELCH:** Do you hear? Your dreamed-of Rejoining is in jeopardy. Are you sure you're not tempted to intervene?

**ALPHINAUD:** (SIGH) You labor under the misapprehension that vanquishing the sin eaters is tantamount to saving the world. It is not. In truth, you only delay the inevitable, lengthening your fleeting lives by the smallest of margins. 'Twould be churlish of me to deny you this small concession, close as we've become. Foolish and misguided though you are, you are not without charm. Each and every one of you is possessed of a noble heart. When the weak want for succor, you do not hesitate to provide it. Alas, your nobility is shortsighted. You think only of the problem in front of your nose. A limitation of your ephemeral existence.

**EMETSELCH:** Our lives may seem short and insignificant to the likes of you. But one does not need to be an eternal being to achieve lasting change.

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, if I may stop you there─I do not claim that we Ascians are *special*. That is another misconception. In the beginning, everyone─*everyone* lived nigh for eternity. Such was the natural order of things. But like so much else, this was taken from you. You won't object if I borrow your plaything. In the distant past, when the world was one and whole, a great calamity threatened all life. It began without warning. The very laws of the star were warped and broken, and chaos swiftly spread throughout the land. Faced with annihilation, we sought to imbue the star with its own will. Thus was Zodiark born, and by His power was order restored. Ere long, however, thankless fools began to fear that Zodiark's might was too great. And so they conjured another to keep Him in check─your own dear Hydaelyn.

**EMETSELCH:** And the two beings waged war until, with a single, devastating blow, Hydaelyn unmade Zodiark, scattering his being across space and time. So you told us in the Qitana Ravel.

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, yes... And *there* began our woes─with Hydaelyn's blow, and all that it wrought. As a counterbalance to Zodiark, Hydaelyn was created with the power to enervate Her foe. This singular ability strikes not at such banal things as flesh, but *everything* that defines the target, diluting its existence. For example, were She to strike you... Two individuals, identical in appearance, yet reduced in all respects. Strength, intelligence, the soul itself─all is halved. Do you see? This selfsame fate befell not only Zodiark, but the very star. Only three were fortunate enough to escape the sundering─me being one of them. When I beheld the shattered remnants of our home, I knew deepest despair. The inhabitants of these fourteen fragments were feeble, frail, and foolish. Oblivious to their imperfection, ignorant of their past. Malformed creatures thrashing blindly about. Pitiful. Disturbing. Depressing. So we took it upon ourselves to rejoin the worlds. But in our eagerness─and, I confess, our ignorance─we erred, and made a useless void of the Thirteenth. It was only afterwards that we discovered a connection 'twixt Source and shard─a flow of energy that maintains elemental balance. And thus did we arrive at our time-honored modus operandi.

**EMETSELCH:** From a purely Ascian standpoint, it could be said that what you seek to do is only logical. But that would be to ignore the immeasurable destruction wrought with each Rejoining. You have murdered millions. And this we cannot condone.

**LYNA:** By your fragmented existence, you continue to give rise to tragedies far crueler than any calamity. But yes, moral relativism and all that. Case in point─I do not consider you to be truly alive. Ergo, I will not be guilty of murder if I kill you. Oh, don't look at me like that. You for whom I have only the highest expectations. A vaunted hero of the Source, seven times rejoined. Long have I awaited one who might brave a path of lesser tragedy. A resilient soul able to endure the necessary pain. I dare to hope that my wait is over. So, finish your task and slay the Lightwarden. Make proof of your usefulness. And then we may speak again.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Forgive me, my lord, but this could not wait.

**LYNA:** Speak freely, Captain.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Our informant in Kholusia sends word of unusual activity in Eulmore. It appears their forces are entrenching themselves at key points throughout the city. Making ready for an attack, by all indications.

**ALISAIE:** An intriguing use of resources. I rather doubt Lord Vauthry is concerned for the safety of his citizens...

**THANCRED:** You think he's harboring the Lightwarden *inside* the city walls? Even if he does have some means of controlling the sin eaters, wouldn't that be a little risky?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Risky or not, if there is even a chance the Warden is hiding there, we will need to act fast. The longer we wait, the better prepared the Eulmorans will be.

**ALPHINAUD:** Agreed. See to your preparations then, and make for Kholusia. Gods willing, this hunt will be the last. Let us see it through to the end.

**URIANGER:** We should begin by assembling in Wright. There we may assess the situation in Eulmore, and decide how best to proceed.

**ALPHINAUD:** Strange. Passing strange... By their behavior, we may safely assume that they are under Vauthry's mind control. Yet the extent of the effect seemeth to vary dramatically between subjects. 'Tis far too pronounced to be attributed simply to the vagaries of innate magical resistance.

**THANCRED:** Curiouser and curiouser... We met with no trouble en route. My thanks for securing the way. But given the state of the townsfolk, I see we were never in any danger of being recognized.

**RYNE:** What can you tell us from here?

**KAISHIRR:** I sense a powerful eater...in the uppermost reaches of the city... But there's something different about it. Its Light is...impure. We need to get closer.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Ohhh! So *that one's* Alphinaud! ...Unless you're triplets?

**ALISAIE:** Kai-Shirr! What are you doing here?

**KAISHIRR:** While I was scouting the area, I noticed a suspicious figure skulking about. So I accosted him─only to have him call me “Alphinaud.” I thought it best to bring him along.

**ALPHINAUD:** You see...that informant who's been feeding secrets to the Crystarium...it's me. See, after you saved my life in Eulmore, I thought about going somewhere far away. But I couldn't just leave, not without paying you back. So I decided to stay here─keep an eye on things. And whenever I spotted something strange, I shared it with your friends.

**THANCRED:** That took no small amount of courage. Well done.

**KAISHIRR:** I assume you saw what happened here.

**URIANGER:** Right, so, an airship flew in a bit ago, and not long after, Vauthry starts ranting and raving. You could hear him from all the way out here! Geezer was doing his nut! Shouting and screaming like someone had nicked his pie!

**KAISHIRR:** 'Tis like the airship bore the soldiers sent to thwart our efforts in Amh Araeng.

**URIANGER:** So eventually the yelling dies down...and then this hot, sticky wind comes blowing through. Now that's when everyone went funny. Everyone but me. Well, me and a couple of newcomers, though even they started mumbling about Vauthry after a while. Not as bad as the rest, mind you.

**YSHTOLA:** Newcomers...

**KAISHIRR:** There's something I need Ryne to see. This was among the townsfolk's food stores.

**RYNE:** Oh, that's just meol. Eulmore doles the stuff out.

**YSHTOLA:** No! It...it couldn't be... I─ I know what it is. It's sin eater. Meol is made out of sin eater.

**URIANGER:** So it is. In limited quantities, it may have little effect on an average individual. Yet if one were to consume it regularly, over a period of several years, I suspect it would do far, far more than merely nourish the body...

**ALISAIE:** That Vauthry wieldeth power over sin eaters is known. Could it be that those who partake of their flesh do thereby render themselves susceptible to his influence? 'Twould serve to explain why the town's newer arrivals succumbed less quickly than those raised on a diet of meol.

**ALPHINAUD:** He's been rounding up sin eaters and feeding them to people!? Altering them mouthful by mouthful─all to stop them answering back!? There are desperate souls out there *killing* themselves to escape turning! This is unforgivable! An atrocity!

**THANCRED:** These sin eaters... What if they are not simply “rounded up”? Do you remember what we were told when first we came to the city? "Many enter, but none leave...“ Let us put an end to it. To this “paradise” built upon the bones of the poor. Vauthry's deeds are beyond justification. Beyond forgiveness. Evil.

**VAUTHRY:** It's highly probable that the Lightwarden is waiting for us somewhere in there, and I'm all for going after it. But our enemies know our faces. They know that we are coming. And they will not let us through without a fight. Like it or not, the time for stealth is passed. Now, my friend. If you would be so good as to lead the charge.

**PUPPETMAN:** Ugh... I can feel it... A dark presence in my domain! Ah! It's them! The villains who would sow chaos in my perfect paradise! Keep them away from me! I command you, keep them awaaaaaay!

**THANCRED:** Long live...Lord Vauthry...

**ALPHINAUD:** He would use his own people as shields.

**ALISAIE:** This area is older than Gatetown. There are bound to be far more civilians under Vauthry's control. But they do not act of their own free will, and we must not harm them.

**RANJIT:** As if we ever would. Press on with Alphinaud. We'll hold off the civilians and join you as soon as we can.

**000:** You will find my master in his chamber... But only should you kill me this day─and you will not.

**RANJIT:** What will you say? Why do you go so far? You're one of his puppets too.

**ALPHINAUD:** You may think me under his spell, but I uphold Lord Vauthry's ideals of my own volition. Man is an inherently flawed creature. In his vain pursuit of righteousness, he but sows the seeds of future conflict. Thus have I chosen to place my hopes upon he who has transcended men. Upon he who is unbound by the vagaries of conscience. But enough talk. I am a soldier, and you are my enemy. Come! Let us settle this once and for all!

**RYNE:** Lord Vauthry! Your reign of tyranny is at an end. For too long, you have preyed upon the desperation of the poor. Now you will answer for the suffering you have caused! And if you harbor even a shred of remorse, I beseech you to use your powers to redress the balance. For the future of all in Norvrandt.

**VAUTHRY:** No... It can't be. This is wrong. It's *wrong*! The Warden─it's not just a sin eater. It's a man!

**RYNE:** Remorse? For the future of all? What nonsense is this? There is no justice but mine. No future but mine. No will but mine. It is preordained. I was born to deliver this wretched world. Me? Unseated? No, no, no, no, no... It's impossible. Inconceivable! *Absurd*! I am a great and wise king. Greatest and wisest! I reign from on high! I will not be brought low by maggots like you! (SCREAM) Oh, yes. Of course. I can begin again. Rebuild my paradise. Once I finish my dinner...

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh gods, no─ Stop him! Thancred, stop him!

**ALISAIE:** Where did he go!? What in the heavens!?

**000:** Did Vauthry do that?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? We must give chase! How will we get up there?

**ALISAIE:** Wait. That is Mt. Gulg, the highest peak in Kholusia. It lies on the other side of a sheer cliff, and much as I wish it were otherwise, it is beyond our reach for now. But even if it weren't─there are people here who need our help.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, Alphinaud...

**000:** Please. Even if it's only to tend to their wounds.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? I'll help too. You don't need my permission. Be quick about it.

**RYNE:** Thank you.

**ALPHINAUD:** I don't know if it will work, but if Vauthry's hold over the people is rooted in Light, I might be able to reverse its effects. Will you let me try?

**ALISAIE:** Of course. We'd be grateful for any help you can provide.

**RYNE:** Well then, if it's decided, let's all get to work.

**ALISAIE:** You're going to be all right.

**ALPHINAUD:** I think that's the last of them.

**DULIACHAI:** We've done all we can for the wounded. As for the rest...

**ALPHINAUD:** U-Um...a-aren't you Alphinaud? The painter boy? What in the world is going on? Did something happen to us?

**ALISAIE:** Let me handle this. Citizens of Eulmore. What I'm about to tell you will come as a shock. Indeed, you may be loath to believe it. But if you trust the evidence of your senses, it is my hope that you will listen and accept the truth, unpalatable though it may be. Vauthry is a sin eater. Everything he offered, everything he promised, was a lie...

**EULMOREPEOPLEA:** They're not taking it well. And who could blame them?

**ALPHINAUD:** Are you saying we were Vauthry's puppets all this time?

**EULMOREPEOPLEB:** When you attacked us, you were not yourselves. That much is true. But your conduct prior to that moment was your own. Vauthry's unnatural charisma does not absolve you of all responsibility. Of your own free will, you came to this city and gave yourselves over to its pleasures. And in the course of this, if you mistreated those less fortunate than you...then that too was of your own free will. It is not for me to judge you, but for your victims. For history. For your conscience. You have dreamed a twisted dream, but now you are awake. You may yet share this world of ours. Join with us and each other that we might begin anew. We've lost so many already. We dare not lose any more. I have said my piece. My thanks for giving me the chance. There is nothing more to be done here. Let us go after Vauthry.

**YSHTOLA:** Is there anything we can do to help? You risked your lives to bring us to our senses, a-and I for one hope to repay that debt. Begin anew, as you said.

**EULMOREPEOPLEC:** Vauthry has fled to Mt. Gulg, and we mean to pursue him. Do any of you know the way?

**YSHTOLA:** The only way to Mt. Gulg is over the Bright Cliff. Have you an airship?

**EULMOREPEOPLED:** We will contemplate flight only as a last resort. Were we to come under attack whilst airborne, we would have little hope of defending ourselves. If at all possible, we would prefer to travel by land. Is there a way?

**ALISAIE:** The Ladder is the only way up and down the cliff, but it hasn't moved in a long time. In the old days, it was operated by the mining folk who lived at the top. But after the Flood it saw less and less use, and when Lord Vauthry took control, it was abandoned altogether.

**EULMOREPEOPLEC:** So we somehow need to get the Ladder working again?

**DULIACHAI:** It moves by means of a Talos, if that's any help. But good luck repairing that...

**CHAINUZZ:** ...Talos? Did someone say Talos!? You know all about them, don't you, dearest! If anyone can get this lift moving, it's you!

**DULIACHAI:** Um...well...perhaps. B-B-But see here─

**CHAINUZZ:** Oh, yes! If you want the golem restored, you may leave it to my husband! For he happens to be the heir to Daedalus Stoneworks, foremost makers of Talos, whose contracts include the renowned mining venture of Amh Araeng!

**DULIACHAI:** It's... Well, i-i-it's been years and years since I had anything to do with it! I-I can't just pick up a hammer and set to work!

**CHAINUZZ:** You...you can't?

**ALISAIE:** N-No, th-th-that's not what I─ I-It's just, I─ ...All right, I will take a look at the Talos, but beyond that, I make no promises! Those with strong backs, come with me. I'll need help dragging the damned thing out of the storehouse...

**ALPHINAUD:** Well done, Brother.

**EMETSELCH:** Come, my friend. We have work to do!

**000:** Would you look at that? The citizens of Eulmore engaging in what can only be described as “manual labor.” Who would have thought it possible? Do you know the most reliable way to deal with those who stubbornly refuse to see reason? You conquer them─crush them under heel. Such was the trusted method of Allag, and one still favored by Garlemald. But conquest is the *easy* part. The true challenge begins once the dust has settled─quenching the glowing embers of animosity and maintaining a semblance of peace. This requires the conqueror to treat the conquered with dignity, and the conquered to let bygones be bygones. A difficult feat to achieve. But you have achieved just that...to my considerable surprise. It's a compliment. Take it. Ahh, the vibrant energy that fills the air when like-minded souls gather. To think back on that time before time fair brings a tear to the eye. What? You thought ancient beings like us incapable of crying? Well, rest assured that if *your* heart can be broken, then so can mine! Back when the world was whole, we had family, friends, loves... Men knew peace and contentment, and with our adamant souls, we could live for an age. There was no conflict born of want or disparity. Our differences paled into insignificance next to all we had in common. And then there was Amaurot... Never was a city more magnificent. From the humblest streets to the highest spires, she fairly gleamed... Not that you would remember any of this.

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? “Remember”? Is this story going anywhere?

**DULIACHAI:** Never mind. The point is: the world of old was a far better place than what we have now. I believe you would like it, having witnessed the things you have. Remember, you are of the Source. Unlike the halfmen here, you stand only to gain. Should you survive the remaining calamities, you will become our equal. A complete existence in a complete world. But such talk is a pleasure for later. Back to work, hero. Ah, there was one thing I had meant to ask. How well do you know the Exarch? Has he ever deigned to show you what hides beneath the cowl? What, *never*? Even to you? How *very* interesting... I shall enjoy working out what it means. Until next time.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Ohhh, I knew you could do it, dearest! I never doubted you for a moment!

**ALPHINAUD:** It's alive. I don't know if you remember, but when we first met in this world, I was all but spent. I never thought to wonder why until now. I think it all just got to be too much. The guilt of causing the Flood... Knowing everyone hated me... But the worst thing was the solitude. Time wears you down, aye...but solitude *eats* away at you. It was *this* close to finishing me off. But as bad as it got, and as empty as I felt...I can't even begin to imagine what it must be like for Emet-Selch. All of which is a long way of saying: don't make a choice that leaves you alone. Nothing is worth that─especially not eternity.

**ALISAIE:** Glad tidings, my friend! The Ladder lives again!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** The three of us have been invited to do the honors. Are you *up* for it? Of course, if you're worried that the whole thing might come crashing *down*, we can always find someone else. That's the spirit! Come on, then!

**ALISAIE:** We rode the Ladder too, my comrades and I. Once upon a time. Watched the horizon grow and the town shrink below us... Awed and terrified in equal measure, we ascended without a word, the silence broken only by the rhythm of the gears. No one but me remembers that day. Remembers our journey...and our end. Retread the path─seek and you may yet find...

**URIANGER:** You're a sight for sore eyes. I don't know about you, but I bumped into quite a few sin eaters out there. You too, then. It seems the closer we get to Mt. Gulg, the more of them there are. Looks a lot bigger from here, doesn't it? If I were Vauthry, the first thing I'd do is surround myself with as many sin eaters as I could lay my hands on. And judging by the number we've already faced, his lordship is of the same mind. This is going to be a tough climb. But first things first: we need to determine if climbing is even an option. The more I look, the less likely it seems... Y'shtola is right to be worried, but flying may be our only choice after all.

**ALISAIE:** There you are. Master Alphinaud was afeared you had met with some misfortune.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Urianger! ...And you too, Exarch! What brings you here?

**ALISAIE:** I wish to observe the final struggle with my own eyes. I arrived at the Bottom Rung too late to accompany you, but I was in time to join Urianger and the others. Come, let us see how this unfolds.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Well, it seems flying is off the table.

**ALISAIE:** If we have learned that much, then the machina have served their purpose.

**URIANGER:** Ah, so that's what they were for. Wasteful, but effective.

**THANCRED:** 'Twould seem our foe will not be reached by land or air. We must needs withdraw to consider another course. Master Alphinaud waiteth for us at Top Rung. Thither should we make our way.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...In short, there's no path, and the sky is thick with Vauthry's winged devils.

**DULIACHAI:** We might consider amaro, but without extensive training, we cannot hope to contend with the eaters. Eulmore's airship fleet, meanwhile, consists solely of transport vessels ill-suited for battle. And without the expertise of one such as Cid, we are in no position to attempt a refit.

**CHAINUZZ:** Oh, it's so *frustrating*! That wretched mountain should jolly well come back down to earth!

**YSHTOLA:** Now, now, dearest. We mustn't disturb these good people at their work. We've ridden the Ladder and seen the sights. It's past time we took our leave.

**URIANGER:** The lady may well have the right of it. Mt. Gulg will not soon come down to earth, nor can we compel it to do so. But if the mountain will not come to the land, mayhap the land may be made to come to the mountain... ...In the form of a Talos. A Talos large enough to reach out and take the volcano in its grasp.

**CHAINUZZ:** To build such a golem would be an onerous undertaking indeed...yet the principle seemeth sound in itself.

**ALISAIE:** Balderdash! No one has ever made one even half that size! Leaving aside the small matter of logistics─which, by the way, would be *no small matter*─the design would need to be *unimaginably* complex! Though, I suppose... Hmm... If its only function is to cling to the ruddy mountain, perhaps it needn't be... A solid base, firmly rooted to the ground─sacrifice mobility to simplify the construction, reducing materials required... Wait, wait, wait! What am I thinking!? We would still need a veritable *army* of people to do the work! Left to the crew that helped down below, it would take decades, if not a nice round century!

**CHAINUZZ:** So we need more hands. And what sort of things would these hands be required to do?

**THANCRED:** Oh? Er... Well, er... Well, let's see... First, we'd need people to procure the stone for the chassis. The rock found near the mountain would suit our purposes well enough. It'd be a simple task to quarry the stuff, but given the stupendous quantity required, we'd need all the help we can get.

**ALISAIE:** We have friends amongst the miners of Amh Araeng. I will go and petition their aid.

**ALPHINAUD:** While you do that, I'll make for Mord Souq. I'm sure I'll be able to drum up some support.

**RYNE:** Then I shall return to Kholusia. From fishers to carpenters, Eulmore is home to all manner of talented folk. I daresay their skills will avail us.

**CHAINUZZ:** Is there anything else you need?

**YSHTOLA:** Well...yes, actually... Magic. Lots of the stuff. As much as possible. To awaken a Talos of this size would require an entire congregation of mages.

**URIANGER:** Many among the Night's Blessed are gifted in the arcane arts. I will recruit them to our cause.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** The fae folk too, possess surpassing aptitude in magicks. Yet they are not wont to cooperate in the endeavors of men. Leastwise, not without making all manner of mischief. That being the case, I would instead call upon the people of the Crystarium─with thy permission, Exarch.

**CHAINUZZ:** We are at your disposal, as are our amaro and chocobos.

**000:** I'm sorry─you mean to tell me you can call on not only the people of Eulmore and the Crystarium, but the Night's Blessed, and the Mord, and even those miners!? But that's just about everyone in bally Norvrandt! Who *are* you people!? And how did you come to have so many *friends*!?

**CHAINUZZ:** What will you say? The saviors of the world. Adventurers of no import. The artist Alphinaud and his assistants.

**DULIACHAI:** Saviors of the world? Are you being serious? Oh gods, you are... No import? You expect me to believe that after you just promised me the help of the better part of the world!?

**CHAINUZZ:** Oh, dearest, have you forgotten already? Alphinaud told us that when we first met.

**YSHTOLA:** Um, actually, that may not have been... Never mind...

**RYNE:** So, as you can see, you will not want for bodies. I trust you will have your design ready in good time for their arrival. Norvrandt is counting on you...heir to Daedalus Stoneworks.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** We'll be back as soon as we can─and we'll bring the whole world with us.

**000:** ...I take it we will be assisting Master Chai. Though I am quite sure he has everything under control... The future is where my destiny awaits... (GASP) Forgive me, I was...lost in a dream. I needed some fresh air, and thought to rest for a moment. It would seem I am more fatigued than I realized. Too much time away from the tower, I fear. It drains me─leaves my body frail and weak. Though, in truth, it is debatable whether I can still call this my body... When first I turned my mind towards the salvation of the world, I came to the conclusion that it would take many long years. Many more than remained to me. And so I made myself one with the Crystal Tower, that I might live indefinitely. I am but an extension of it now. Hence my weakness the farther I travel, and the longer I am away. It has been quite a journey. But thanks to you, the end is in sight. My wish will finally be fulfilled. How goes the construction effort? Then this may be the last moment we have to ourselves for a while. Come, sit with me. Tell me, when all of this is over, what will you do?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? I'll settle matters with the Empire. What I always do: seek out mightier foes. Rest awhile. ...

**000:** Ah, yes. Even should we succeed in forestalling the Eighth Umbral Calamity, the specter of war will remain. But to declare your intent with such easy resolve... You truly are a heroes' hero, my friend. In the hundred years they have existed, no one had come close to ridding us of even a *single* Lightwarden. Yet already you yearn for the next challenge. You truly are a world apart from us all. That would be well deserved. You might consider roaming Norvrandt not as her savior, but as a simple sightseer. Viewed through such eyes, I am certain she would seem quite different. Well, you needn't hurry to decide. I was merely curious to know what sort of future lay in store for a hero with her life ahead of her. But whatever it is you decide to do, I have every confidence that you will do well. For you have the strength to forge your own path. You will leave countless lives better than you found them, and the souls you touch will never forget your kindness. Then, in trying times, when you question your worth and your choices, they will raise their voices to remind you of the difference you have made. And thus will your deeds come to affirm your path. Remember this.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? What will *you* do when this is over? I would know more of you.

**YSHTOLA:** When this is over... Indeed... Of *me*? You mean what I intend to do afterwards? I once told you that there are things we can ill afford to lose. "Things,“ I said, though in truth I spoke of a person. One who is unaware of the full extent of my plans. Though he deserves to know, I have good reason to keep my counsel. “Things,” I said, though in truth I spoke of a person. One who is unaware of the full extent of my plans. Though she deserves to know, I have good reason to keep my counsel. I have come to terms with this in my mind, yet my heart yearns to lay everything bare. For she is my inspiration, and I would give much and more for the chance to speak with her as friends, with no thought of concealment. Should she indulge me with her tales, I would regale her with my own─about my efforts in Norvrandt, perhaps. Though...ultimately, that tale is more yours than it is mine. Then...I would ask her about her next adventure. And if she should wish me to be a part of it, oh...how happy it would make me. Together, we would travel the lands and cross the seas and take to the skies upon the eternal wind... My heart swells simply to imagine it. But all of this is contingent upon our victory in the coming battle. The people of this world have entrusted their hopes to us. We cannot fail them. ...Nor those who roused me from my slumber. Thank you for your company, my friend. Let us return to Amity.

**THANCRED:** Word from the Exarch. All is set on his side, and we may proceed when ready.

**URIANGER:** Well, we have sufficient stone for our needs.

**ALPHINAUD:** Likewise, preparations for the imbuing have been made according to thine exacting instructions.

**YSHTOLA:** Then you need only say the word!

**CHAINUZZ:** Let us begin. See that everyone is in position. We shall catch Vauthry, mountain and all!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Here it comes! Hah hah! Yes! *Yes*! You've not lost your touch, you clever old bugger! Do you see what they're doing!? If its hands are damaged, it won't be able to cling to the mountain! Oh, I *knew* this was a terrible idea!

**FEOUL:** Vauthry marshals the eaters to his defense. This was only to be expected. We must try and draw as many of them down to the ground as possible. It may not be enough, but we have no other choice. Is that─?

**000:** Such a heartless thing our sapling is! Cold and cruel and *heartless*! Summon us in times of need, we *expressly* said─yet what should we find but the final battle joined without so much as a *whisper* of our name! Yes, yes, we may also have said that we fae folk have no interest in the struggles of men─ But if our *adorable* sapling had come crying to us for help, we would of *course* have flown to her aid! Of course we would! What are we to do with her? We are so very, very sad. *You* will play with us. *Cheer us up again*!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Thank you, Feo Ul. I think they're mad at me...

**ALPHINAUD:** This I did not expect. But I will gladly accept the help. I will send word to Y'shtola and the others. Join them at the foot of Mt. Gulg and be ready to make the ascent!

**VAUTHRY:** The end is near, my friends. We have found Vauthry's hiding place.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Vauthry-)Unrepentant villains. Will you not be satisfied until you have brought disaster down upon your own heads? (-Vauthry-)By your wickedness, you stand to gain naught but ceaseless conflict! (-Vauthry-)Had you only entrusted your fate to me, there would have been peace for all. (-Vauthry-)You could have lived in bliss in my eternal paradise, free from the burdens of conscience and purpose!

**RYNE:** Peace assumes many forms, and I do not doubt that you considered yours well worth the cost. I was even prepared to believe that the end might justify the means. Ignorant as I was, I had hoped that you might mend your ways and join hands with us. That we might strive together for the happiness of all... ...But no more. Your actions cannot be reconciled with your words. "Peace for all,“ you say, yet when you were threatened, your first act was to sacrifice your own people in order to save yourself. If your paradise can be rebuilt so long as you alone survive, it exists not for the people. It exists solely for your twisted pleasure!

**VAUTHRY:** Hear me, Vauthry. The people won't submit to your will. For we each have our own. I made a promise to a noble soul─a woman who saw fit to entrust me with her legacy─and I mean to keep it. Everyone who stands with us has something precious, something that they cherish and would die to protect. They know their own hearts. They know what they want for this world. And by lending their strength to our cause, they have spoken! No matter how hard you may try to bend the world to your will, we will never yield!

**YSHTOLA:** (-Vauthry-)*Silence*! Not another word! (-Vauthry-)You presume to lecture me? Insolent worms! You will learn your place! (-Vauthry-)With my true powers awakened, I will expunge you like the filth you are. Your demise will serve as a reminder to all─ (-Vauthry-)That *I* am the zenith of mankind and sin eater both, chosen to rule over creation by right of transcendence! (-Vauthry-)My very existence is virtuous! I am perfect! *Immaculate*!

**ALPHINAUD:** He seems disinclined to grant us an audience.

**VAUTHRY:** Find Vauthry. We will hold the eaters here. Come! Let's finish this!

**ALPHINAUD:** Why? Why am *I* cast down...when it is *you* who are the villains? Father told me...that I am hope. I am righteousness. That I am...a *god*... That is why I was born...as man and sin eater both... I kept the people safe! They respected me! Worshipped me! How can this be? I should be the one...looking down at you... Help me, damn you... I...am your god...

**OLDEULMOREMAYOR:** Look! The sky!

**EMETSELCH:** Fools! Were it not for my decisive action, the whole city would have been overrun! Razed to the ground! Yet they dare to complain about casualties? Spare me. I'll wager they were put up to it by those wretches who seek to usurp me. They're stirring up the citizenry. But if they think I will yield to the likes of them, they are gravely mistaken!

**OLDEULMOREMAYOR:** (-???-)To be subjected to such deplorable treatment... Such ingratitude! You have my sympathies, sir. You do so much good for this city, and you could do so much more, were you not surrounded by fools...

**EMETSELCH:** Who are you!? You're not supposed to be in here!

**OLDEULMOREMAYOR:** My apologies for the intrusion, but I come bearing a proposal. One that will ensure the longevity of your reign. But give me the word, sir, and I will bring hither a Lightwarden. By giving its power to the babe within your lady wife's womb, we shall create a transcendent being─a king to rule over all. And as sire to the king, your authority will never again be in question.

**EMETSELCH:** Haha! Amazing! Before my Vauthry, they behave as docile pets! With this gift, my line shall be guaranteed power for perpetuity! We shall rule the whole world!

**ALISAIE:** By all means, sir. United under Eulmore's banner, men will cease fighting and abandon their ambitions. Thus they will grow fat and complacent, and in their sloth seal your supremacy...

**YSHTOLA:** Are you all right!? S-Say something!

**RYNE:** Twelve forfend, he cannot contain the Light. He's beginning to turn! Twelve forfend, she cannot contain the Light. She's beginning to turn! Urianger! If you've aught up your sleeve, now is the time!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** It's changing back!

**ALISAIE:** The combined power of every Lightwarden is too terrible a burden for any one soul to bear. And so I shall relieve you of it.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Exarch!? What are you doing!?

**RYNE:** I will channel this profusion of power to the Crystal Tower and use it to travel to other worlds. As I have dreamed of doing ever since I first learned of their existence! Who would choose to remain here, in this dying realm, when they might go elsewhere and begin anew? Not I. And thus...thus did I *use* you!

**ALISAIE:** No... No, I don't believe you! It doesn't make sense!

**URIANGER:** Damn you! We won't let you do with her as you please!

**YSHTOLA:** Do not interfere! Please! I beseech you all! *Let him go*!

**ALPHINAUD:** You knew of this, Urianger. 'Tis all a fiction. Such vaguely defined acts of teleportation stand no chance of success. The Exarch will never live to see another world─as he knows only too well.

**YSHTOLA:** Then...what does he mean to do?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** He means to take the Light with him into the rift...where he will die. He means to take the Light with him into the rift...where he will die. From the beginning, he intended to sacrifice himself to save our friend and Norvrandt.

**000:** At journey's end, an opportunistic thief makes off with the hero's prize. A paltry way to end a chapter, I concede. Yet your tale will continue, and my role in it will scarcely be remembered. Worry not. Whatever should become of me, I will be happy and free, safe in the knowledge that I have played my part.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you do? Remain silent. Call him by his name.

**EMETSELCH:** Thank you for fighting for this world. For believing. Fare you well, my friend─my inspiration. Thank you for fighting for this world. For believing. Fare you well, my friend─my inspiration.

**THANCRED:** Only those who possess the Royal Eye of the Allagan imperial line are capable of controlling the Crystal Tower. Such individuals do not exist in the First. Therefore, in all likelihood, the Exarch arrived here with the tower. This much I had surmised, yet I could not discern his grand scheme. To think that he went through all this trouble for the sake of a single hero. It's almost admirable in its absurdity. Alas, it is not your grand scheme that will succeed, but ours.

**EMETSELCH:** You bastard!

**000:** Stay put. Your friend is still alive, but whether he remains so depends on you. What a disappointment you turned out to be. I placed my faith in you. Let myself believe that you could contain the Light. But look at you now, halfway to becoming a monster. You are unworthy of my patronage.

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? What do you intend to do? It was you who created Vauthry, wasn't it?

**ALPHINAUD:** (SIGH) I am an Ascian. My heart's sole desire is to usher in the Great Rejoining. A hundred years ago, I entrusted my comrade Loghrif with the task of increasing Light's sway over this world. This we sought to do by manipulating heroes. When that failed to achieve the desired result, I created Vauthry. But thanks to your meddling, that too has ended in failure.

**EMETSELCH:** What was your true purpose in approaching us?

**THANCRED:** By your Twelve, boy, have I not told you before that everything I said was the truth? You were specimens by which I might gauge man's potential as it stands. I genuinely had an interest in you. Genuinely considered taking you on as allies. Provided *she* could contain and control the Light. If not then she─and by extension you─would be of no use to me. 'Twas as simple as that.

**EMETSELCH:** So we've been found wanting. How disheartening. But even had we fulfilled your conditions, there was no guarantee that we would cooperate. What then?

**ALPHINAUD:** Then I simply kill you all. At the very least, it would restore the world to the way it was before you went about trouncing Lightwardens willy-nilly. Suffice it to say it would be most inconvenient to have all that Light taken away─and I would be lying if I were to claim his actions didn't have me worried. Hm, you still retain your form and your senses...but you have all but become a sin eater. Whether you will it or no, your mere existence will serve to engulf the world in Light. Those in your company will likewise turn into sin eaters, and in time you will succumb to your base instincts and hunt innocents to feast on their sweet, sweet aether. Those few with the will left to fight may rise up against you. But before your absolute might, they will quickly know despair. "There is no hope! We are finished! *Mankind* is finished!“ Ahhh, the irony. What Vauthry achieved through bliss, you will achieve through despair. But I have overstayed my welcome. I shall look forward to seeing you bring the world to its knees, hero.

**EMETSELCH:** Exarch!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** I have naught to show for all the time and effort I invested in you. He is a small token for my troubles. I did not expect that I could learn aught from man, but I may yet learn something from all the knowledge he had hoarded for his precious hero. I pity you, I do. Your friends are now your foes. If you do not kill them, they will kill you. When it all becomes too much to bear, seek me out at my abode, in the dark depths of the Tempest. There, you may complete your descent into madness with some dignity, far from prying eyes. Till then, I bid you farewell...eater.

**000:** Ah. Finally.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? Was it just a dream? What happened?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**000:** The people of this city have spirit, I'll give them that. They've not lost the will to fight. I can imagine how torn you must feel, looking at that sky. Knowing what it means to everyone...and that you're responsible.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? The secrecy is worse. I'd rather people knew. I still can't believe it's coming from me. It's all such a mess.

**FEOUL:** If you're thinking of coming clean, don't. It might make *you* feel better, but it would make things a hundred times worse for them. They're better off not knowing. <sigh> Neither can I, to be honest. But you heard what the Ascian said: the Light you shine will warp the world around you whether you like it or not. Even Y'shtola and Ryne had to concede that point. Aye. An all too familiar one. Here you stand alone, expecting no one else to bear the burden for you. You're in a corner, and there doesn't seem to be any obvious way out. ...But that doesn't mean it's over. However hopeless it seems, you haven't lost yet. I remember looking up at the sky like this before─being caught up in a strange kind of calm. It was after we realized we were responsible for the Flood. When we resolved to journey to the Source by taking our own lives. One last sacrifice, one last fight...one last failure. And then the Oracle appeared and...well. You know the rest. There were times in the years and decades that followed when I wondered if we might not've been better off just letting the Rejoining happen. That we'd made one last mistake... But seeing that giant Talos stir to life cured me of any doubts I still had. Always. Always we took the burden of fighting upon ourselves. That's what heroes do, isn't it? So we never had the chance to see anything like that─our people, coming together as one. To think that their hope still burned so bright... ...That they were still so eager to live, they would lift up their fellows, one on top of the other, till they reached the sky. No, we made the right decision. And I can finally feel proud of the part we played in helping this world survive. Well? Come on, then! As I thought. What happened between us was no coincidence. My story may be finished, but the fates have gifted me a minor role in yours. I suspected as much the moment I realized you could hear me. But it's hard not to doubt yourself when you're the man who caused the Flood... I was afraid to do anything more than watch for fear of making things even worse... ...But no longer. After all, the path I once walked is now yours to finish. For what it's worth, I cast my lot with yours. If you need a push, I'll be right there behind you; if you lose control, I'll do my best to stop you. So─let us be about it, *hero*.

**LYNA:** I was worried you were up here all alone, brooding and fretting and wallowing in your woes. But look at you─grinning at nothing like a pollen-drunk pixie! Hmph! Look at what you've done to your aether! It's a mess! And you have cracks running all through that pretty soul of yours! My poor little sapling. Whatever am I to do with you? Shall I yield up my throne? You could claim it─cut ties with the mortal world, hide away in the castle... It won't fix the problem...but would it really matter? If any pesky heroes come calling with steel and magic, all of Il Mheg will rise up in your defense. My crown and scepter are yours...if you want them. What? Don't give me that look! Of course I knew before I asked that you'd never ever heed such a *wicked* suggestion! And besides, what would become of my precious and ephemeral flower? My dear, beloved sapling. You are lost─confused─and have precious little time to gather your wits. Your kind is always so preoccupied with what lies ahead, and so we muddle your vision with fog and glamour. But such trickery is easy to see through. Stand very, very still. Think not of where you need to go, but where you are right now at this moment. At this time, in this place... Our [friend] of crystal. From shadowed hood he watched you go, his ruby eyes with warmth aglow. See yourself as he saw you, and that shall be the clearest clue. You stand in his garden, dear sapling. Ask his flowers what they know, and you will surely find an answer. But what will you do with it, I wonder...? I'll be watching and waiting, waiting and watching!

**URIANGER:** I have unlocked the door to the Umbilicus. You are free to enter. Once you have what you require, I'll see it sealed once more. Until then, I will remain without.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** A moment to collect my thoughts, I prithee... Thy true name is G'raha Tia, then. By thy claims, thou too art a native of the Source, though from an age beyond our own, when the Eighth Umbral Calamity hath visited devastation upon our star. Thou hast, by subtle means, reached across the boundaries of time and space to unsow the seeds of catastrophe, ere its creeping vines drag our champion unto an early grave...

**URIANGER:** In essence, yes. A difficult story to swallow, I am sure...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (SIGH) I doubt not the veracity of thy words─not the account of thy coming, nor that of the fated Calamity. Yet my mind straineth still to apprehend the enormity of this tale. Wouldst thou favor me with a gradual unfolding of its chapters?

**URIANGER:** Certainly. But where to begin? I should start with those great minds who survived the Calamity─Cid Garlond being perhaps the greatest. In hopes of staying the unending tides of war, he and his fellows pursued all manner of possible solutions. One of these was rooted in a theory which unified several fundamental principles discovered over the course of the Warrior of Light's adventures. It proposed a method by which one could enter the river of time, traverse the rift, and leap between worlds. Perfecting that idea, however, was a work which consumed their lifetimes. And thus was it left to future generations to decide whether theory would be put into practice. But all the while the world continued to burn. Hope was a feeble outpost, beset on all sides by thievery and misery and murder. People cried out in despair, “There is no hope. We are finished. *Mankind* is finished.” Then others raised their voices in answer. "Though we be beyond salvation, those who came before may yet be saved.“ "We will forge a crossroads, and pave the way for a different future. By the wisdom of our forebears we will prevent this Calamity from ever having come to pass.“ The fighting went on unabated, but some few took up Cid's research, and labored to realize those impossible ideas. After two centuries of labor, their descendants finally succeeded in awakening the Crystal Tower─an integral part of the process─and in doing so roused its caretaker. Me. By this stage, scholars had largely established the phenomena underpinning the Rejoining, and identified the First as the shard which precipitated the Eighth Umbral Calamity. This grand structure was already capable of storing the energies required to attempt the translocation. All that remained was to augment some few of its functions, based upon the theoretical models of Cid and his compeers.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And by means of such technologies didst thou effect thine arrival in the First, to an age before this star had joined with the Source.

**URIANGER:** Some while before, as it turned out. 'Tis all but impossible to predict how time will flow between one world and the next, and we missed our mark by almost an entire century. But this only worked in our favor. The sin eaters could not be defeated without the blessing of Light, and summoning the only man who might stand a chance against them would require decades of preparation. But this only worked in our favor. The sin eaters could not be defeated without the blessing of Light, and summoning the only woman who might stand a chance against them would require decades of preparation.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...An undertaking of scarce credible endurance. That thou hast kept thy plan from falling into disarray these many years bordereth on the miraculous. Yet howsoever history be rewritten, thy present self was shaped by events which followed the Calamity. Should said catastrophe be averted, the very skein of thine existence will unravel. Surely thou hast foreseen this...

**URIANGER:** I am aware of the consequences. 'Tis for that very reason Cid and his colleagues bequeathed their legacy as an offering...and not an edict. To give all of oneself for the happiness of others, and with no promise of reward? 'Tis a hard thing to ask. Harder still for those condemned to survive in a world which pitted brother against brother. Indeed, you were right to call the execution of this plan “miraculous”─though the force which held it together was nothing so inexplicable. It was him. The Warrior of Light has been our unbroken thread. It was her. The Warrior of Light has been our unbroken thread. Where others would stumble and fall, she would rise above. Where others would break and run, she would carry on. The Warrior of Light's tale is one of unyielding bravery. To tell it was to feel courage; to hear it was to feel hope. It was a breath of inspiration in an age of suffocating shadow. In the histories of a fallen nation was our hero hailed as its greatest ally. In the timeworn pages of a noble's memoirs were her deeds joyously retold. For many, these stories were the flame which warmed them through the coldest of nights. And so it should come as little surprise that the plan found no shortage of volunteers, concerning as it did the Warrior of Light herself. It was their chance to add their own verse to the hero's saga. He was the lodestar that brought them all together, to send their final message back through time and space...to him. She was the lodestar that brought them all together, to send their final message back through time and space...to her. "The light of your legacy was our torch in the darkness. Burn bright again...and live.“ I am merely the bearer of that wish, come to ensure it is safely delivered.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Wherefore sharest thou this burden with me and no other? What wouldst thou have me say?

**URIANGER:** That you will be my accomplice? 'Twas you yourself who convinced me of your suitability when you spoke of how you learned of the Flood, and of your part in arranging Minfilia's journey to the First. Your actions showed uncommon resolve. 'Twas clear you were committed to the cause of saving this world. I knew I could trust you to choose the right path forward...even if that choice came with a heavy price.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...What price?

**URIANGER:** When all is said and done, and the last of the Lightwardens lies slain, I will absorb their corrupted aether. And then I will die. Knowing what I know of your companions─not to mention your champion─they will try to stop me. But in saving one they would save none. Therefore I implore you to aid me in concealing my identity, and ensuring this tale ends as it must. To this end, I would have you take what I have told you of the Calamity and make of it a portent─a prophetic vision you beheld in the swirling chaos of the rift.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...Is this truly thy wish?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** History remembered the Warrior of Light, as I knew it would. And I will suffer no other to rescue the champion whose star has charted my course. At this point in time, I yet travel with the Warrior of Light in Eorzea. And I would not have matters here interfere with that of all episodes in my life. At this point in time, the Warrior of Light and I have yet to meet in Eorzea. And I would not wish that meeting soured by events which happen here. I will see this tale to a happy end, my friend. There has been enough tragedy.

**000:** Careful, now. If you lose control again, the Light could claim you for good. Although it's probably only a matter of time before you succumb to the change, in any case. What do you mean to do?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? I mean to hunt down Emet-Selch. I mean to rescue the Exarch. I mean to have a few words...with both Emet and the Exarch.

**URIANGER:** (AMUSED HEH) Then we should be on our way. The Ascian mentioned the Tempest, did he not? That's “the stormy seas around Kholusia” to you. His lair must be down there somewhere, hidden beneath the waves.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, we have found thee. Word reached us of thy recovery, and thus did we gather with all haste. Ah. By thy looks, I gather thou hast gleaned that which I came to tell thee.

**URIANGER:** Urianger has shared everything with us─the Exarch's true identity and purpose.

**000:** I offer no excuses. When I agreed to aid the Exarch with his plans, 'twas in full acceptance of the condemnation I would face when my duplicity was laid bare. ...Yet it is not rancor but resolve that I sense in thee. Thou art fully intent upon walking thy path to its end, art thou not? If thou canst forgive my deception─or, failing that, set aside thy displeasure for a time─I do beg leave to follow thee. What strength and wisdom I possess are thine to command.

**URIANGER:** What will you say? I forgive you. Let's go. I am a danger to those around me. No more lies.

**RYNE:** ...I thank thee. Doubt not but that I will do all in my power to repay thy kindness, and fulfill the Exarch's wishes. I understand the precarious nature of thy condition. Nonetheless, it is my wish to remain at thy side for as long as I am able. Pray believe me when I say that I took no pleasure in deceiving thee. Indeed, I curse the circumstances which compelled me to do so... But no further secrets lie between us, I swear it.

**ALISAIE:** I'm sorry but...I don't think this is a good idea. Leaving the Crystarium, I mean─with or without Urianger. What I did for you won't last forever. There's no telling when the Light will break free again. Please, you must stay here, at least for a little while longer! We will find a way to cure this, I promise you!

**ALPHINAUD:** How can you make promises!? We don't even know where to start!

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie, please. You know Ryne was only trying to help.

**ALPHINAUD:** Of course I know! I know only too well! But making promises you have no way of keeping is not a kindness─it's a lie, plain and simple! We've all searched high and low for an answer! And every one of us came back empty-handed! I am not about to stand in her way now─not after failing her in her hour of need! No, the least we can do is...

**YSHTOLA:** We will go with you, as well. There is naught to be gained by standing still.

**THANCRED:** Indeed, we have exhausted every other avenue. Lead and we shall follow. If there *is* any hope to be found, then we will surely find it at your side.

**CASSARD:** Are we *all* in agreement, then?

**KATLISS:** (-???-)Is there aught we can do to help?

**ALPHINAUD:** Though we may not know the whole story, we do know you're in for a fight. And while the Exarch's away, it falls to the rest of us to see the Warrior of Darkness is given a proper send-off!

**LYNA:** You told them!?

**GLYNARD:** No! Well...not in so many words.

**BRAGI:** Aye, we didn't need it spelled out for us. When the night sky appeared over whichever place you went to, it was harder *not* to put two and two together!

**CRYSTARIUMGATEKEEPER:** From the moment I heard that you and the Exarch shared a homeland, I had my suspicions. Long had he been waiting for a certain someone to arrive...and I knew at once that it must be you.

**CRYSTARIUMWOMAN:** Exactly! When he went out to meet you, 'twas clear it was no ordinary visitor. That spring in his step spoke volumes. I could feel his excitement!

**CRYSTARIUMMAN:** Me too!

**CRYSTARIUMOLDMAN:** That's right!

**MOREN:** Hear, hear!

**YSHTOLA:** We do not fully understand where you or the Exarch hail from, or why you've all done so much to protect us. But we are deeply grateful, nonetheless. So if there is anything at all we might do to aid your journey, you need only name it. What would you have of us?

**000:** You might have invited them to join us, were there not so many. But come, they are waiting. What is your will, O Warrior of Darkness?

**URIANGER:** What will you say? Defend the Crystarium until we return! Leave it to us─we'll see the Exarch home safe and sound! Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst...

**BISMARCK:** [O great and serene Bismarck.]

**URIANGER:** (-Bismarck-)[Long has it been since my name was called.] (-Bismarck-)[Why do you wake me, little neighbor?]

**BISMARCK:** [To the bottom of the western sea we go. Pray lend us your back and your breath.]

**ALISAIE:** (GRUMBLE) (-Bismarck-)[This world is in twilight. I wait for the sun to set. I wish only to sleep.]

**000:** Oh dear. I don't need to speak Fae to know that didn't go well...

**FEOUL:** What will you say? I know what to do! We need Feo Ul!

**BISMARCK:** (LAUGH) My [adorable sapling]! You've learned to call me at last! And where do you go? On a trip? A journey? I *knew* you wouldn't give up without a fight! Oh, my precious mortal. I shall help you in any way I can! [Sleepy Bismarck, you old pixie! These are my precious, precious saplings.] [Let their wish be the king's command.]

**FEOUL:** (GRUMBLE) (-Bismarck-)[What a rare thing to awaken to.] (-Bismarck-)[My beautiful king. If it be thy wish, then so shall it be done.]

**URIANGER:** Be sure to scrub this one's teeth for him upon your return. It's only good manners.

**FEOUL:** It will be done, Your Majesty. Our deepest thanks for your timely intervention.

**BISMARCK:** An agreement is reached, and your departure is at hand! You wingless ones best hold on tight! May the blessings of the fae keep you safe, [shining souls]!

**IRVITHE:** (-Bismarck-)[To the western sea we go. Wrapped in my breath, I will see you to your destination, little neighbors.]

**GRITHIL:** And just like that, it's all gone back to the way it was...

**IRVITHE:** What was you expecting? Hundred years of honey and rainbows? Seeing them Eulmore types wake up and smell the ashes was miracle enough for me.

**GRITHIL:** Ah, but the magic in the air when that Ladder started moving...hah! And when that great hulking Talos rose up, *gods*... I could live a thousand years and never behold anything so amazing...

**IRVITHE:** What the─! Do you see that!?

**GRITHIL:** What a monster! Where did it even come from!?

**IRVITHE:** Uh, wha... Wh-Whoa there...

**BISMARCK:** It's not stopping... Run! *Run*!

**RYNE:** (-Bismarck-)[I have fulfilled my duty. I return now to the lake.] (-Bismarck-)[I have not flown in an age. It was...pleasant. May your journey be a safe one, little neighbors.]

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Wow...

**READEROFONDO:** The breath of Bismarck. See how it swells to form a dome beneath the waves... The waters recede. The Tempest's floor is laid bare. In defiance of the blinding sky, this place holds fast to its gloom. The last refuge of he who denies the Light with every fiber of his being. You stand at the precipice, hero. Journey unto the Heart of Darkness. Finish it.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** O stewards of the Ondo... We offer up our light in answer...

**000:** That crystal you showed the artisan... Was it...? Did it belong to one of my friends?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? I thought you were always watching? Miss that part, did you?

**ALPHINAUD:** I try to give you a *measure* of privacy... No one wants a spirit looking over their shoulder every moment of the day. So tell me, if you would. How did you come across that crystal? It was Renda-Rae's, then... It was Nyelbert's, then... It was Branden's, then... It was Lamitt's, then... I was right, then... I was right, then... Strange that I should learn such things now, after they're long gone. They were fine friends, every one of them... I didn't expect death to teach me so much. About them, about Seto─about you. About the hope that hides at the heart of this world. I've never been one for idle chitchat, but if by some miracle I could see them all again, I doubt I'd ever stop talking... I'm grateful I got to bend your ear, at least. And just for that, I reckon I'll stick with you...to the very end.

**YSHTOLA:** Apologies─we were a little late to the gathering.

**THANCRED:** It seems we've succeeded in gaining their trust.

**ALPHINAUD:** The delay wasn't exactly welcome, but at least our many hands made light work. And they seemed especially impressed with your contribution. Our hero, indeed.

**ALISAIE:** Y'shtola was telling us those structures may date back to the age of the Ascians.

**ALPHINAUD:** An Ascian homeland... Despite his many protestations, I never quite believed Emet-Selch was telling the truth.

**ALISAIE:** Nor I. But there is no denying the evidence before our eyes. Clearly, this was once a great city... ...A home they would see restored, no matter how many tens of thousands of years it takes.

**RYNE:** It's a hollow dream, when you think about it. Even if they manage to rejoin all the worlds, they'll never bring back the ones who were lost. But would I have done any different...?

**YSHTOLA:** Are you...? How are you feeling?

**READEROFONDO:** You have completed your devotions?

**URIANGER:** Yesss... To the honored ancientsss have we offered up our prayers and our gratitude. You, too, have our thanks.

**READEROFONDO:** Might we trouble thee then to tell us more of the illuminated land of which thou didst lately speak?

**ALPHINAUD:** To the west of here lies a great trench. Some days ago, a light appeared in that endlesss darknesss. Curiousss, we ventured closer...and discovered in the depths an entire city. The buildings we spied were akin to our own everlasting abodes. Impossibly so. We understood at once─the ancients had risen. There could be no doubt. Taken with terror, we retreated to the Cupsss, and I decreed that none should enter the trench until such time as we received a sssign.

**READEROFONDO:** Might it still be possible to reach this city of the ancients?

**ALPHINAUD:** Hm... With no water to drown you, a finless one could now travel there, yesss. I am convinced you are the sssign for which we have been waiting. My people will show you the way.

**ALISAIE:** Shall we?

**ALPHINAUD:** By the gods!

**YSHTOLA:** When the Ondo spoke of a city, I did not think they meant an actual city!

**EMETSELCH:** Then...we are seeing the same view. The remnants in the Ondo settlement were solid, material structures, but these... Everything here pulses with aether. 'Tis an enchantment on a monumental scale!

**ALPHINAUD:** This really is unacceptable. I gave you very specific instructions.

**EMETSELCH:** Emet-Selch!

**YSHTOLA:** My invitation was for an abomination, ripe with the power to bring about the world's annihilation. Not this half-broken...thing. Whatever am I to do with you? And I see you insist on keeping the same familiar company. Are you so lost without them?

**EMETSELCH:** It is not *she* who is lost without the familiar. Not content with remaking an entire city, you aim to fill it with the reconstituted souls of the dead.

**000:** I may have gotten a *little* carried away, in my attention to detail. Added a few unnecessary flourishes... Weeell, there's no point trying to hide it. Yes. Once the rejoining of worlds is complete, Zodiark will regain His full strength and shatter His prison. Then we shall offer up the Source's remaining inhabitants in sacrifice, that we might resurrect our brethren who died to bring Zodiark into existence. But what was it that *you* came here to do, exactly?

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? We came here to stop you. We came here for the Exarch.

**ALPHINAUD:** Did you now? One last do-or-die attempt to foil my plans before your mind dissolves into madness? How very, very...heroic of you. In every single age, there is always *someone* who wants to stand up to the evil Ascians. Always the same arrogance, the same insistence that the world belongs to them. As if theirs were the only rightful claim, theirs the only existence worthy of preservation! Well, you can't have him. The wisdom that man guards may open up new worlds of possibilities. He has unlocked the secrets of travel across the rift─and through time as well, it would seem. Quite an accomplishment for one of his “incomplete” nature. I must explore the limits of his capabilities, and harness that power for the Ardor. Even now, after everything, you refuse to see reason. You think it unfair that you are subject to suffering? That your lives will be sacrificed for the ancients? Look at me! I have lived a thousand *thousand* of your lives! I have broken bread with you, fought with you, grown ill, grown old! Sired children and yes, welcomed death's sweet embrace. For eons have I measured your worth and found you wanting! Too weak and feeble-minded to serve as stewards of any star! Have your recent spats with Vauthry and his sin eaters taught you nothing? Have you not learned that your ignorance and frailty beget only endless misery? How long do you mean to perpetuate this farce? How much more must I endure your bumbling interference? Let us imagine that the laws of reality are again undone, and the world faces true annihilation. Do you honestly believe that half your number would sacrifice themselves to save the other? Of course they wouldn't! And if *you* had witnessed history unfold as *I* have, you would reach the *same* conclusion! You cannot be entrusted with our legacy. I will bring back our brethren. Our friends. Our loved ones. The world belongs to us and us alone.

**EMETSELCH:** Emet-Selch! We understand. Truly. But it makes no difference. The ones you love are in the past. While ours are here in the present. One day, we too will be ashes and dust, but not today. Our time is not yet finished. We share your conviction...and that is why we will not abandon our course.

**ALPHINAUD:** You think us the same? You think your tattered soul of equal worth to those *I* lost? Then come─*earn* your place. Prove yourselves *worthy* to inherit this star. Behold, the coming oblivion. 'Twas the end of our era, and the beginning of our great work. A fitting backdrop...for your final judgment. I shall wait within, but do not spend too much time on your preparations. There's no telling how much longer the guest of honor will last. Well, well, you prevailed... Nevertheless!

**ALISAIE:** (HIT REAX)

**EMETSELCH:** (HIT REAX)

**ALISAIE:** Your performance was underwhelming, and I remain unconvinced of your worthiness. Oh, you tower over your misbegotten ilk, no doubt. But should I bring my full strength to bear, well...you would be as leaves in the wind. The gulf between us is a reflection of the disparity between the world as it was...and what it has become.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hah! (GRUNT) Our worlds may not live up to your lofty standards... But they are *our* worlds! *Our* homes! Full of life and love and hope! And we won't stand by and let you destroy them! Ugh!

**EMETSELCH:** Alisaie!

**ALPHINAUD:** You are a mistake. For we who have known perfection, the shattered Source and these shards are ghastly mockeries of the true world. The ephemeral lives you exalt are pale imitations, utterly devoid of meaning.

**EMETSELCH:** Belittle us all you like, but we will rise again and again, and give the lie to your insults through word and deed. *We* define our worth, not the circumstances of our creation!

**YSHTOLA:** Hmph, more prattle. Fool. Who are you? No one. *Nothing*. Once I have reclaimed my heritage, my first act will be to expunge your stain from history's weave. My world will have no need for heroes. Still fighting the good fight...

**URIANGER:** It is true that all we hold dear is fated to fade away. But that is no reason for us to forsake it!

**EMETSELCH:** To take what steps we may, and thus mark the road for those who would follow. To strive for the best of all futures... Be this not also thy purpose!?

**THANCRED:** Do not presume to speak of *my* future! And *you*! Why waste your final moments in futile defiance? Weary wanderer─you've no fight left to fight! No life left to live! Hah hah hah hah hah! You see! The Light will not be denied! Surrender to your fate, and let the transformation take you! Rise up in madness and fury! Devour the vermin infesting the land which is rightfully ours!

**EMETSELCH:** Now, Ryne! Now!

**THANCRED:** Bah!

**RYNE:** Hng!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Fight it... You have to hold on!

**000:** If you had the strength to take another step, could you do it? Could you save our worlds?

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** What will you say? You know I could! What, all by myself?

**EMETSELCH:** Heh. Take it. We fight as one! This world is not yours to end... This is our future. Our story.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** No... It can't be... Bah, a trick of the light. You are a broken husk, nothing more. How can you hope to stand against me alone?

**EMETSELCH:** We stand together!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** How did─!? ...I'm surprised you can stand at all.

**EMETSELCH:** I could not well leave matters half-finished. Let expanse contract, eon become instant! Champions from beyond the rift, heed my call!

**000:** Damn you! Damn you all!

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? I challenge you, Emet-Selch. It ends this day. One way or another, it ends.

**THANCRED:** Very well. Let us proceed to your final judgment. The victor shall write the tale, and the vanquished become its villain! But come! Let us cast aside titles and pretense, and reveal our true faces to one another! I am Hades! He who shall awaken our brethren from their dark slumber! I...will...not...yield. Should I surrender this fight, what will become of it all...? What will become of our triumphs? Our hopes? Our...our despair? What of this anguish which yet burns in my breast even after the passing of eons? No, no, no! I will not let it all be for naught!

**EMETSELCH:** Enough, damn you!

**YSHTOLA:** Raaargh!

**EMETSELCH:** Such...*infernal*...strength...

**ALPHINAUD:** Raaaaaargh!

**URIANGER:** Ugh!

**EMETSELCH:** Now! Strike with all thy might!

**ALPHINAUD:** Remember...remember us... Remember...that we once lived...

**ALISAIE:** It's over. Emet-Selch is no more!

**URIANGER:** More importantly, how do *you* fare?

**YSHTOLA:** ...What dost thou see?

**RYNE:** His aether... It is...it is as it used to be. Her aether... It is...it is as it used to be. As a disciple of Zodiark, the Ascian was the Darkness to your Light... I can but assume that when you set your strength against his, the Light within you was spent.

**000:** No. It's more than that. Under the strain of that incredible flood of aether, your soul had begun to break apart. Yet now it seems somehow...restored. I tried to help you before the battle, but Emet-Selch stopped me. So, h-how did you─exactly what did you... Can you tell us what happened?

**RYNE:** What will you say? I had help from a hero of this world... I'll explain it all another time...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I see...

**000:** Where to start...? I believe I owe you all an apology. And you most especially.

**THANCRED:** What will you say? Let's get out of here first! I'm tired─we'll leave the lecture for later. 'Tis good to see you awake, G'raha Tia.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** No arguments here!

**CHAINUZZ:** うう Well... 'Tis good to be awake!

**IRVITHE:** So, those mad souls dove straight into the ocean over there, did they?

**DULIACHAI:** Ah, a-all I could see from here was the whale, Master Chai...

**CHAINUZZ:** 'Twas surely Alphinaud and those friends of his! They did something *heroic*, mark my words! You need only look up there for proof of that!

**DULIACHAI:** As you say, my love. They're sure to be back─any moment now. Any moment...

**CHAINUZZ:** They are coming back, aren't they? I couldn't bear the thought of...of... (SOBBING)

**GRITHIL:** There, there, dear. Everything will be all right...

**IRVITHE:** There! There! Look, over there! Over at the beach!

**GRITHIL:** Ho there!

**CHAINUZZ:** Greetings!

**DULIACHAI:** You all right!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Welcome baaack!

**ALISAIE:** I didn't think...we'd be swimming...the *whole* way back... Heavens...heavens... Take me...

**RYNE:** Alphinaud!? Oh, hells...

**THANCRED:** Wait! Where's Urianger!?

**RYNE:** He must have fallen behind...

**YSHTOLA:** But...shouldn't we look for him!?

**ALISAIE:** He'll wash up sooner or later.

**FEOUL:** For the love of─ Alphinaud!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Welcome back, dear ones!

**NEXTHEROBOY:** And thus did salvation come to the First. The lamps of Amaurot will fade along with Emet-Selch's enchantments, and the depths shall be as once they were. Mt. Gulg will one day fall, and the Talos below yield to wind and rain. This tale, too, will fade with time, passing into legend as the world heals and moves on. Nevertheless... As aether obeys the cycle─as death and decay gives way to new life... So too do the memories we share inspire others to rise to greatness. For we who walk before may lead those who walk after. Your road goes ever on, as does your story. As does your legacy. Such is the hero's lot─to touch the lives of countless others...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Excuse me! You're the Warrior of Darkness...aren't you? Where are you from, really? And how did you get to be so strong!? Where are you from, really? And how did you get to be so strong!?

**YSHTOLA:** By your deeds has the blinding Light been banished from these skies, and the sin eaters driven to retreat. Although our many hurts will be years in the mending, I have faith that this world and her people will one day be whole once more. With no Rejoining in prospect, the Source need no longer fear the coming of an Eighth Umbral Calamity.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And with that triumph, the future from which you came will no longer come to pass... Yet, here you still stand.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...So I do. I wonder if that other age continues onward somehow, cut adrift from time's flow? Or have I simply etched myself a place upon this new block of history? Either way, this is an unexpected development. As the summoner of your souls, my death was meant to release you back to your world. Yet I am very much alive, and you are still stuck here in the First.

**ALISAIE:** I believe I speak for us all when I say that we are happy to postpone our return if it means your life is spared. We will seek out another way.

**URIANGER:** Besides, I never had any intention of rushing home. There are people here I still need to thank, and this means I might actually have time to do so.

**THANCRED:** Yet we dare not neglect our comrades in the Source. Mistress Tataru, to name but one, will be most anxious to know how things stand with us.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** So─you'll just have to make the journey alone for the moment. Be sure and give a full report to our fellow Scions, would you? Oh, and we'd also appreciate any news you can bring us from back home.

**YSHTOLA:** Then I see no reason to delay. I can open the path from here.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I imagine we each have matters demanding our attention, so let this be a farewell for us all. Send word when you've resummoned our friend. Oh, and do try to ensure she arrives *within* the city next time.

**RYNE:** Hah! Of course! I shall strive for utmost accuracy! No strange forests or unplanned passengers, I promise.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I'm a little relieved, to be honest. I would have been terribly lonely if everyone had suddenly disappeared... But I understand that you have to go. Safe journey, Warrior of Darkness. I hope to see you again soon!

**SYSTEM:** Just a moment while I attune the portal, then you can be on your way. When I was a boy, many long years ago... ...I yearned to stand tall as the heroes of eld. But like a fool seeking to pluck the stars from the heavens, my every attempt to reprise their deeds fell short... And then, one day, an all but forgotten dream from my youth stood before me, in the flesh. A hero who looked to the horizon and beyond, and saw I knew not what. All I knew was that I would give anything to stand at that hero's side. Would that it were so easy... The glory of the heavens was ever beyond the grasp of those who never thought to reach for it. But if I've gained anything from all of this, it is the courage to stretch out my hand. Do you hear me, G'raha Tia? This is no time for sleeping!

**ESTINIEN:** Meanwhile, in the imperial palace in the Source...

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Hmph.

**ESTINIEN:** To the west gate! I want to know what's happening there.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Same as the others─struck down with a single blow. An unfortunate day to draw guard duty. Forgive me. These were your people.

**VARIS:** We took advantage of this slaughter to slip into the palace. 'Tis not for me to grieve them.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** (-???-)Aaagh!

**ESTINIEN:** That was the Emperor!

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Wha─ Wait! (GRUNT)

**ZENOS:** Your Radiance!

**SHADOWHUNTER:** (-???-)Gaius! You've missed your part in this, I'm afraid.

**ZENOS:** Identify yourself, demon!

**ESTINIEN:** You were hoping for the Ascian? The craven shed this skin and fled rather than face me. A pity─I was looking forward to crossing blades with myself. But I cannot deny the feeling of satisfaction... Body and soul, reunited at last!

**SHADOWHUNTER:** What now? The game continues, but the pieces have changed.

**VARIS:** Only if we trust in a paragon's words─a mistake I do not intend to repeat. (CRY)

**ZENOS:** Gaius! He speaks...the truth... Elidibus is gone... Tore a hole into the rift... (GRUNT) Zenos... My foolish, greedy son... Was a second life not enough? Was the Empire too rich a prize to ignore? True freedom for our nation─our people─will never be won by a spoiled princeling! The burden of this throne is beyond you.

**VARIS:** Hmph. 'Tis you, Father, who have struggled with this burden. Simply holding the Empire together has occupied your limited faculties. But you may take comfort in knowing that I have no intention of pursuing your tedious agenda, nor am I interested in ruling over the Empire's lands. I came only to remove that which ruins my sport. I will not have my prey stolen by your petty wars and cowardly weapons.

**ZENOS:** You would kill me just for that...?

**VARIS:** I need no other reason. Any and all who interfere with my hunt... ...will not do so twice!

**ZENOS:** (SCREAM)

**SHADOWHUNTER:** I heard the Ascian speak of Zodiark and Hydaelyn. Even the will of this star is but a construct of our own making... We shall gorge upon their strength, and then, my friend, our contest shall begin anew.

**ZENOS:** Zenos!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Hmph...

**AMAUROTADMINISTRATOR:** (-???-)...May I? (-???-)You, I think, are from a time beyond ours. Have you followed in the wake of Emet-Selch? (-???-)Nay, there is no cause for alarm. I am simply a shade. Here and not here. I know only that my name is Hythlodaeus, and that this city is a recreation─a phantom moment plucked from the well of history. These others seem unaware of their pale existence, but I wonder if Emet-Selch's mind was distracted when it came to my reconstitution. A stray thought would have been enough. “Hythlodaeus will realize the truth,” for example. We were...close friends once, you see... Yet in spite of my perception, I play the same role as all the rest─a bit part, meant to bring color and noise to this well-crafted stage. Too much scrutiny, and we shall burst like the fragile bubbles we are. Thus I tell you again: my presence is naught to concern you. I wish only to share your company whilst we wait. ...If you've come this far, then you know of the catastrophe which awaits us on our “morrow.” The Final Days. What began as isolated incidents soon swelled into a world-spanning threat... The Convocation of Fourteen─well, it was Thirteen at the time─endeavored to create a will for our star. They would repair the fundamental laws of order and halt the spread of destruction. But creation on such a scale required an immense source of power... Of those of us who still lived, nearly half offered up their lives in the name of salvation. And from their sacrifice, Zodiark was born. Just as we had hoped, He reached forth and halted the march of oblivion. ...Yet oh how the star had suffered. So many species lost. The land was blighted, the waters poisoned, and even the wind had ceased to blow. Once more did our people give of themselves to Zodiark. Another half of our race sacrificed to cleanse the world; to ensure that trees and grasses and myriad tiny lives would sprout and grow and flourish. The cycle of life had begun anew, and we reconsidered the means by which we might protect it. The Convocation decided thus: we would nurture our world until it was bursting with vitality. Then, when the time was right, we would offer some portion of its living energy to Zodiark... In return, He would restore to us those brethren whose souls had fed His strength, and together we would resume our role as stewards. There were, however, those who disagreed with this plan. They argued that enough had been sacrificed to Zodiark─that this new world should belong to the lives newly born. These dissidents surrendered their life energies in the creation of Hydaelyn, an incarnation of their opposing belief. And for the first time in history, our people stood divided... Know you, then, how this conflict ended? ...Hm, I thought you might. Emet-Selch has ever been a champion for the will of Zodiark. The original plan may have been set back by millennia, but he will have not abandoned his course. He will pay the price for our return by whatever means is necessary. And though he may carry himself with a certain glib ease, Emet-Selch is not a man to bear his burdens lightly. In fact, I imagine they have only grown heavier with every passing century... ...'Tis truly a terrible weight he has chosen to carry.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** _WARRIOR_OF_LIGHT_...

**AMAUROTADMINISTRATOR:** It seems your turn has come. Pray do not let me keep you. ...Ah, there was one last thing. You walk with another at your side, yes? Nay, I see no definite form...just the faintest suggestion of a second soul. I doubt it visible to anyone but me. Otherwise, I assume only *you* can see and hear this ethereal companion? Hm hm hm... Your connection is hardly a coincidence. In our time, the two of you were one─the color of your souls tells the tale. A hue that distinctive cannot be mistaken, no matter how thin the soul is spread. Hah! This is just the kind of fate I might expect for one such as he. Surely Emet-Selch has recognized the hint of “him” in you...? Hah! This is just the kind of fate I might expect for one such as she. Surely Emet-Selch has recognized the hint of “her” in you...?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** _WARRIOR_OF_LIGHT_...?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**VAUTHRY:** Who goes there? Are you the one who broke the seal? Ah, so much time lost... So much frolicking and feasting left undone... We must make up for it, we must... Beginning by playing with *you*! We can play...no more...

**EMETSELCH:** Are you so determined to die? One last chance, villains: bow down and acknowledge your king. Your god! But...I am all-powerful...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**TATARU:** You're here. Good.

**KRILE:** So...how are they?

**TATARU:** Still locked in slumber. But otherwise in good physical health. ...For the present, at least.

**KRILE:** For the present? ...Oh no, is something wrong with them!?

**TATARU:** I'm afraid there may be. I summoned you after detecting faint signs of instability in Thancred's corporeal aether. But subsequent examinations suggested all five might be affected. And when I examined them just now, my fears were confirmed. Tellingly, the degree of instability varies between them. Thancred exhibits the most notable signs, followed by Y'shtola and Urianger. The twins' aether, meanwhile, remains relatively stable, but there is a change there too if one knows to look for it.

**KRILE:** Hold on─isn't that the order they were called away in?

**TATARU:** Indeed. Which leads me to believe the instability will only increase with time. Though I can but speculate, I fear this may be a symptom of a weakening link between body and soul.

**KRILE:** By the gods... What happens if the link is broken?

**000:** I cannot say for certain─this is all unknown territory to us. Yet whatever happens, it cannot be good. Mercifully, the instability is still only slight. And you may rest assured Master Matoya and I will do everything in our power to keep it from worsening. Be that as it may, it is imperative that you find a way to restore our friends' souls to their bodies.

**KRILE:** What will you say? Leave it to me. No rest for the righteous, eh?

**TATARU:** Thank you. I realize you've only just returned from saving two worlds, but time is not on our side.

**KRILE:** But where's she even supposed to start? We had the greatest minds in the realm hunting high and low for an answer, and they ran out of places to look.

**URIANGER:** You stated in your report that the Exarch had originally intended to reverse the summoning process by means of his own death, correct? Raha always was a reckless young fool... Ready to die for the first righteous cause that came along. His plan might well have worked, but I for one am glad he never had the opportunity to see it through. Even if it does mean our friends must remain stranded awhile longer. There is another way, I am sure of it. And the key lies with him. With the Exarch. Pray return to the First and apprise him and the others of the situation. We, meanwhile, will do what we can from here and, if the fates are kind, we will have good news to share upon your return.

**YSHTOLA:** Pray excuse my late arrival.

**URIANGER:** Will Thancred and Ryne not be joining us?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Nay, milady. With apologies to all, they beg leave to pursue their investigation of the Empty to its conclusion. Should matters here demand their presence, however, they did assure me that they would make themselves available.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes, of course. Then let us proceed. I...I think it best that you begin by providing a summary of Mistress Krile's findings.

**YSHTOLA:** I suppose it was only to be expected that some change would occur...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Yet our souls seem unaffected. To my eye, at least. How long they will remain so is another question. Krile is right. It is imperative we find a way to return to the Source.

**ALISAIE:** Perhaps an explanation of the method by which I brought you here will yield some inspiration. Ere I begin, it must be noted that I am by no means a gifted mage. In order to employ powerful magicks, I must rely upon the Crystal Tower and its boundless reservoirs of energy. The magick that summoned you was no exception. 'Tis a singular spell, adapted through painstaking effort from the technique that transported me to the First. To use an analogy, it works by cutting a hole in the fabric of reality. A hole tailored to the object of summoning, through which it─and it alone─may pass unscathed. Though I succeeded in creating said hole, I failed to latch onto my intended target. Instead of you, the spell found those close to you, and ended up summoning them in their incomplete state... I would not soon throw my life away─not after the lengths you and yours went to save it. And so long as I breathe, I will spare no effort to see you safely home. But should all else fail, and your lives be at stake, there remains one sure method... Ow! What was that for!?

**YSHTOLA:** How can you even entertain such thoughts!? You owe your life to the Warrior of Light, and you don't get to die unless she says so.

**ALISAIE:** Your followers await your divine judgment.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Excuse me?

**YSHTOLA:** Pardon?

**ALPHINAUD:** [Report if label displays] If the two of you have finished, perhaps we could return to our discussion? Rather than dwelling upon the multiple failed attempts at transference, I think it would behoove us to focus on the solitary success. I would draw your attention to the fact that our friend can travel between worlds possessed not only of her body and soul, but her personal effects besides. This is no different from the teleportation magicks to which we are all accustomed─magicks that allow for the transportation of those inanimate objects one considers to be an extension of oneself.

**ALISAIE:** Are you suggesting that, simply by considering us his possessions, he could carry our souls back to the Source upon his person? Are you suggesting that, simply by considering us her possessions, she could carry our souls back to the Source upon her person?

**URIANGER:** Well, it would be nice if things were that simple for a change. But vague notions of ownership seem a rather tenuous thing to stake our lives on. So much as a moment of doubt on her part, and we'd be left floating in the rift.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Milady hath the right of it. The requisite fixity of belief would be too much to ask even of our friend. Yet were we to immure our souls within an object in her possession, mayhap then our safe passage could be assured. White auracite would, I believe, serve as a suitable vessel for this purpose. 'Twas conceived to imprison the massy soul of an Ascian, and should house one of ours with relative ease. We would need only to ensure our souls' safe preservation inside the stone, and identify a means by which they might be transferred back unto our vacant bodies.

**ALISAIE:** Soul preservation and transference... Hm. I believe I know of someone who may be able to assist us. On the far shore of the Source, there stands a great palace built by the elves. It was forsaken in the wake of the Flood, but a certain Nu Mou chose to make their home there soon after. Though they have long lived as a recluse, they once occupied a place of honor in Voeburt's royal court, and it is said that none in all of Norvrandt is more knowledgeable than they on matters of the soul.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Well, I've no objection to seeking a helping hand, but if they've gone to such lengths to hide themselves away from the world, what makes you think they'd be willing to lend us one?

**BEQLUGG:** Heh. A worthy question. Years ago, I myself tried─and failed─to solicit their cooperation in the battle against the sin eaters. No sooner had I begun to make my plea than they unleashed a swarm of their familiars upon me. Unlike me, however, you have curried favor with the fae folk. By that merit alone, I am hopeful that they would grant you an audience. They may still be inclined to turn you away, of course, but if their knowledge might feasibly facilitate your return home, we have to try.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** That was my fiercest familiar. Impressive...

**BEQLUGG:** Beq Lugg. 'Tis good to see you again after all these years. And judging by your vigorous greeting, I daresay the feeling is mutual. To be sure, a simple *shake* of the hand would have sufficed by way of welcome, but I shan't complain. But you must be wondering as to the purpose of our visit. We come to *beg* your assistance in a most urgent matter.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...Sh-Shake? Beg?

**BEQLUGG:** Our comrades' very souls are in danger. If we are to save them, we will need the benefit of your unsurpassed knowledge on the matter. Please, will you not *sit* and hear our plea?

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh... How dare you. How dare you speak thus in my presence. It was to escape such words of temptation that I hid myself from the world of men... You are sinners one and all, and I swore never again to have any part in your affairs.

**BEQLUGG:** I can only imagine what terrible events forced you into a life of seclusion... But I know that the Nu Mou are a good and noble folk. It is not in your nature to turn a blind eye to the plight of those around you. And in treating with us, I am certain whatever mistrust you feel for man will begin to...*heel*.

**000:** Ahhh.... If you will not be satisfied... I suppose I could listen... After all, there's no harm in just─ No! No, no, no! I mustn't. Not again... That damned court mage seemed to have the best of intentions too, and countless innocents died for my naivety! You know not what you ask of me. What horrors my knowledge has wrought...

**BEQLUGG:** What will you say? Refuse all you want! We won't lie down and accept defeat! We would never misuse it! You mean the magical plague of Voeburt?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Ahhh! Ohhh! Of all the visitors I could possibly have... They're even more stubborn than I am...! You wish only to save your friends? Nothing more? Do you swear it? You know of the plague!? Then you know how dangerous soulcraft can be! Instead of saving your friends, you risk damning them. Are you sure you're willing to take that chance? Mmmm.... Oh, very well... I will hear your petition, but that is all! And I expect fitting payment for my troubles...

**BEQLUGG:** Commensurate with your contribution to our cause. No more and no less, I promise you. With that settled─might I impose upon you to join us at the Crystarium? I'm afraid the nature of my friends' predicament calls for absolute secrecy.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I'm sorry... You mean to tell me not only that the return of night was your doing... ...But that you hail from another world as well!?

**BEQLUGG:** Everything we told you─of the Source, the shards, the seven Umbral Calamities─all of it is true. I realize how fantastical it sounds, and I would not blame you for doubting our testimony... But given your expertise, you must surely have noted the peculiar nature of their souls.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Any other time, and I would have dismissed your stories as balderdash and flummery. But upon closer inspection, 'tis plain their souls are far denser than is normal. And that they do not possess true bodies. Save you. Your body is your own. And your soul is the densest of them all. Hmmm...

**BEQLUGG:** As I said before, were it not for their heroism, the skies over Norvrandt would still be awash with Light, the realm yet at the mercy of Vauthry and the sin eaters. After all they have done for our home, seeing them safely back to their own seems the very least we can do.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Hmmm... Your tale is intriguing. Yes, very intriguing indeed. Simply to hear it is fitting payment in itself. As for your friends...I can but agree. Their valorous deeds on behalf of Norvrandt are deserving of recognition. Of their own fitting payment.

**BEQLUGG:** You will help us, then?

**ALPHINAUD:** I will. I would see my knowledge put to good use for a change. I do have one condition, however. I am not the spry young Nu Mou I once was. As such, I will require assistance in my fieldwork and testing.

**BEQLUGG:** It would be our pleasure. We will be laboring for our own benefit, after all.

**ALISAIE:** Let us begin. I trust you've prepared the clay? Very good. Now, I would have you sculpt for me...a porxie. Plump, with floppy ears, and a short, curly tail.

**ALPHINAUD:** A porxie. I...think I know what you mean... There we are. H-How's that?

**ALISAIE:** Well... It is certainly creative. There's no denying that. (SNICKERS)

**BEQLUGG:** Yes, yes, I'm no artist. Very funny!

**ALISAIE:** Pay him no mind, child. Though it may look like a grotesque parody of reality, it is what the invoker believes that matters.

**BEQLUGG:** You're not helping.

**ALISAIE:** But I speak the truth. If successful, this incantation will turn imagination into reality. Which is why the only thing of import is what you believe this figure embodies. You must focus. Hold the porxie's image steady in your mind's eye. Now then, as I taught you. Relax, and allow your energies to flow.

**BEQLUGG:** With flesh of clay I bid thee rise,
On wings of dreams to touch the skies.
What once was idle fantasy,
I call forth to reality! [Report if label displays]

**ALISAIE:** Hmmm. Not bad for a first attempt. Now, let us see what can be done for young Halric. Through the operation of the magicks you invoked to animate this familiar, it is now replete with the energies required to stir the boy's soul. You need but give it a name, and it will do as your heart desires.

**HALRIC:** A name... All right, I've decided. Now... Go, Angelo!

**DULIACHAI:** (INCOHERENT MUMBLING) M... Mother... I...

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, thank heavens you're here.

**DULIACHAI:** Lady Chai, whatever is the matter?

**ALPHINAUD:** I...I knew not where else to turn. Oh, this is all too much for my poor heart to bear alone.

**DULIACHAI:** Alone? What of Master Chai?

**ALPHINAUD:** But that is the very reason I summoned you! He's gone!

**DULIACHAI:** What!? What happened!?

**ALPHINAUD:** It all began after the events at Mt. Gulg... With Lord Vauthry out of the way, we all agreed that a new leader must be chosen...

**DULIACHAI:** And...so you held an election?

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes. Well...sort of. Not a single person volunteered to stand, you see. After a lifetime of leisure, we free citizens have grown somewhat...indolent. Readapting to the harsh realities of life is trying enough, but to take charge of a broken city as well? No one wanted such responsibility. Nevertheless, Eulmore could not well do without a leader, and so we decided that anyone and everyone should be considered a candidate. And after we cast our ballots and tallied the votes, the mayorship fell upon my dear husband.

**DULIACHAI:** Well, given the manner in which he orchestrated the construction of the giant Talos, none could deny his leadership qualities.

**ALPHINAUD:** But even before then, he had proven himself at Daedalus Stoneworks, don't forget. He is more than qualified for the role. The perfect choice. Indeed, I told him as much when his victory was first announced. But perhaps I was too forceful in my attempt to encourage him. For shortly after that, he vanished without a word... <sob>

**DULIACHAI:** You believe he was so daunted by the burden of leadership that he felt compelled to flee...? Please, Lady Chai, dry your eyes. Your husband does not strike me as the sort of man who would abandon his duty, much less his beloved wife. There has to be some other reason for his absence.

**000:** You...you truly think so? What about you? What do you think has become of my husband?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? I don't know. But whatever it is, he won't have fled. Sorry, but I think he's fled.

**DULIACHAI:** And there you have it, Lady Chai. You needn't worry. Master Chai loves you more than all the world, and he will return. Nay, my friend. The one thing he has not done is flee─of that I am convinced. Through the most testing of times, he has ever remained at Lady Chai's side, placing her happiness before his own. He would not abandon her now. Wherever he may have gone, rest assured we will find him.

**WRENDEN:** Thank you, my dear boy. You have set my mind at ease. I will trust in my husband, and await his return.

**CHAINUZZ:** Well, well... It's you again... And I see you've invited your friends. Need them to fight your battles for you, do you?

**WRENDEN:** I didn't invite them, as it happens...though they are indeed my friends. Not only mine, but every true Eulmoran's. They are the ones who awakened us to the truth─to Lord Vauthry's villainy. The famous Warriors of Darkness.

**CHAINUZZ:** Are they now...

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes. They are. It would be no exaggeration to call them our saviors. We owe much and more to their kindness. But we cannot depend on that kindness forever. To do so would be little different from entrusting our affairs to Lord Vauthry. Nay, we must learn to stand on our own two feet, and I would have them present to witness my attempt.

**WRENDEN:** Hear, hear, Master Chai!

**CHAINUZZ:** Your sentiments are admirable. Yet admirable sentiments do not a nation make. In my capacity as advisor, I once strove to build a better Eulmore. Gave honest counsel to my superiors. Drafted laws for the benefit of one and all... But in time, my values fell out of favor. There was no need for them in this paradise Vauthry was creating. And so I left my homeland behind. But you, Chai-Nuzz─you were content to wallow in indolence under Vauthry's auspices. And so I cannot help but ask myself what manner of nation you intend to build.

**WRENDEN:** I...I can offer no simple answer to that question. But this much I will say... It is my hope that Eulmore can become a nation which her citizens might freely choose to build together. A great many people─myself included─flocked to Eulmore seeking sanctuary. The alternative being to live in fear and die in pain, it seemed an easy choice. And sanctuary we found. As much food and drink as we could ever want, secured at the cost of the surrounding villages. Little wonder the people gathered at our doorstep, begging to work among the bonded. The free were blind to it all, of course. Content to─as you say─wallow in indolence. In ignorance... Were I mayor, I would first take stock of the city's resources, and see that they were assigned equitably. Our days of reckless consumption are behind us. The distinction between free and bonded died with Vauthry. The needs of rich and poor alike must be considered if our nation is to survive. To which end, I would take steps to secure channels for supplies, rekindle relations with nearby settlements, reestablish industry, reach out to neighboring nations...and the list goes on and on. But I am no ruler, nor even a politician─I am an entrepreneur. My expertise lie in planning and profit. I haven't the knowledge or experience to run a nation. Please, Wrenden. Will you not help me? Together, we could solve the city's problems. Build a Eulmore for the people.

**CHAINUZZ:** A Eulmore for the people... I rather like the sound of that. But before I offer you my counsel, I would be certain of your ability to perform the duties of office.

**WRENDEN:** You would? 

**CHAINUZZ:** You ask me to help you solve Eulmore's problems, but first, I would see you solve one on your own. Accomplish that, and you will prove both to me and the people that you are a man worth following. Hmph.

**DIRTYMAN:** Right. Right, then. Form a line and make for Eulmore!

**EULMORANSOLDIER:** Hm? What's that noise? Wicked white! Runaway Talos! Call the guard!

**DULIACHAI:** Stay back, all of you!

**CHAINUZZ:** Is that...!? Darling, you're back!

**DULIACHAI:** Well of course I'm back. You didn't s─ Dear─ Dearest─ I─ I can't─

**CHAINUZZ:** Oh! Oh dear...

**DULIACHAI:** Thank you.

**CHAINUZZ:** I'm sorry, my darling... It's just, the sight of you filled me with such joy, I couldn't help myself...

**DULIACHAI:** It's all right, dear. I should just have come out and said what it was I was intending, instead of entrusting the task to a hastily scribbled letter.

**CHAINUZZ:** Does that mean you'll do it?

**DULIACHAI:** Well, I'm here, aren't I? I mean, not that my absence signified any unwillingness, you understand. Naught could be further from the truth! I only left to enlist the aid of the former mayor's senior advisor. And now that I have it, I believe I am ready to take office.

**CHAINUZZ:** Oh, how wonderful!

**DULIACHAI:** [Report if label displays] Dearest... Please... Ah, er... Ahem...

**CHAINUZZ:** Go on, dear.

**KRILE:** Thank you all for gathering here today. Before going any further─could I...could I ask the free citizens of Eulmore to look around? 'Tis a sight none of us would ever have seen under Lord Vauthry's rule. Not only do we stand in the familiar presence of those we once called the bonded... ...But today we welcome the peoples of the Derelicts and Gatetown too. Today we welcome the Warriors of Darkness, come to bear witness to Eulmore's new beginning. As you know, an election was recently held, at the end of which I had the honor of being chosen to succeed Lord Vauthry. You place great faith in me, and I promise to do my utmost to live up to your expectations. And I will seek always to carry out the duties of this office with integrity and fairness. Always, I say, but not forever. Let it be known that I do not intend to hold this post indefinitely. I consider myself but an acting mayor who will serve only for the interim, while Eulmore is reshaped according to a new set of values. No longer can we think of ourselves as divided. As the free and the bonded. Citizens and non-citizens. The systems put in place by Lord Vauthry must be undone. But even as we tear down the old, we must give thought to the new. To what manner of nation Eulmore should become. Whatever the answer may be, it cannot be decided by one man alone. And so I propose that an open forum be held, that we might all discuss how best to strive towards a better future. However, there can be no talk of the morrow unless we first address the issues of today. Securing new sources of food, rebuilding relations with our neighbors, re-establishing industry─there is much and more that needs to be done. Too much for a mere man of business. And so I pledge instead to do everything in my power to ensure our city's security and stability while we all work together to see these problems solved. The road before us will not be easy, and I know full well how daunting the prospect of honest labor may seem to some of you... But we must accept the reality of our circumstances. We must move forward. This much we owe to ourselves, and to the brave heroes who risked their lives to bring back the night. Once we have shored up our city's foundations, and regained some semblance of normality, let us reconvene to speak of the future. Until then, I humbly ask that you lend me, and each other, your strength. For Eulmore!

**TATARU:** Sorry to keep you waiting. I have carried out the treatment as per Master Matoya's instructions. It should slow the destabilization of their corporeal aether quite significantly. But tell me, how fare our friends in the First?

**KRILE:** So this Beq Lugg's the First's leading authority on soulcraft, are they? Sounds promising!

**ESTINIEN:** And Urianger's proffered solution of white auracite is rather ingenious now that I think of it. Well, while they press on with their preparations, you may rest assured we will continue to do our part here.

**TATARU:** Oh. You're back. And none the worse for wear, I see.

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien! Oh, thank the gods. We've been worried sick! Did you lose your linkpearl or something!?

**TATARU:** The situation in Garlemald has become more complicated. I was making my escape from the capital when I ran into one of yours─Riol. He thought it best we come straight here.

**ESTINIEN:** More complicated how?

**TATARU:** Hm. Where to begin? After entering the Empire via Radz-at-Han, I went about my mission of investigating Black Rose. It was then, inside a provincial factory, that I encountered the one who styles himself Shadowhunter. Gaius Baelsar. Our goals being apparently aligned, we joined forces and ventured on into the heart of the capital─to the very imperial palace itself. There, we found a man whom all assumed dead. But his soul lives on. And he has wrested back his flesh. Zenos yae Galvus. Nor did the surprises end there. For no sooner had we arrived than he murdered his sire in cold blood. The Emperor is dead. This sent Gaius into a rage, and he charged in, blade drawn... What's wrong!?

**ESTINIEN:** Are you all right!?

**KRILE:** Peer into my past, did you?

**ESTINIEN:** Well, I didn't quite relive the experience as you did, but I bore witness to it all.

**KRILE:** I'm still not sure what I think of this gift of yours. But no matter. Our confrontation was cut short when the imperial guard arrived. It was then that Zenos took his leave. Citing boredom.

**ESTINIEN:** To think their research into the Echo could bear such fruit... Escaping death, jumping from one body to the next, and returning to his own after all this time... He is an Ascian in all but name.

**KRILE:** It beggars belief, aye. But no more than a hero traversing the rift between worlds. My concerns are far more prosaic. With the Emperor dead and the crown prince missing, the Empire is in disarray. Until order is restored─assuming it even possible─we needn't fear an imperial reprisal. And for reasons of his own, Zenos took it upon himself to rid the world of Black Rose. Riol has already gone to apprise the Alliance leaders of these developments. We may leave the matter in their hands for now.

**ESTINIEN:** Then perhaps we have seen the last of the fighting at Ghimlyt. Though if it comes to civil war, I cannot help but fear for the provinces... Ah, I'd nearly forgotten to ask─what became of Gaius? Did he not escape with you?

**TATARU:** That he did, but we parted ways shortly after leaving Garlemald. He claimed another threat had arisen which demanded his attention. He didn't elaborate, but the absence of some device or other in the capital gave him reason to believe they're planning something. Lest you worry, I believe he has well and truly shed the Black Wolf's pelt. Conquest is no longer his objective. We may safely leave him to his own devices.

**ESTINIEN:** Well, it's nice to have one less foe to worry about...even if we do have a mysterious new threat to look out for instead. Speaking of which, I'll see that Riol and our shinobi are made aware. Though we still know next to nothing, it can't hurt to be vigilant.

**TATARU:** Well then, with Black Rose nipped in the bud, I believe I've fulfilled my part of the bargain.

**ESTINIEN:** That's...true, buuut...with the Archons still slumbering away, we were hoping you might agree to stay with us for a little bit longer...

**KRILE:** Sorry, but I'm not inclined to extend my contract. Gaius isn't the only one with business to attend to.

**ESTINIEN:** Thank you for your help then, Estinien. I see why Alphinaud admires you so.

**KRILE:** Hmph. Farewell, my friend. See that you don't make a habit of dozing off in battle.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**9S:** 出たぞ！ アイツが機械を操っている元凶だ！！



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**RAUBAHN:** They're here, Commander.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** And I for one am grateful that they are. I'm told you've been busy since our paths last crossed at the Ghimlyt Dark. Not that I understand half of it. When the Scions spoke of other worlds, I'd struggle to describe what I pictured. Mayhap things would seem clearer were I to hear the tale from your own lips, but I'm afraid the situation will not afford us that luxury. I trust you two require no introduction.

**RAUBAHN:** We meet again, hero of Eorzea. Must we repeat this ridiculous display? I pose no threat to you─though what I come to warn you of very well might.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Had he meant to do us harm, I hazard he would have kept to the shadows─and brought more than two companions. We need not pretend to be the best of friends, but I hope we can put aside our differences for the present.

**KRILE:** As you are doubtless aware, Ser Estinien and I cooperated to rid the world of Black Rose in your absence. Our journey together took us as far as the imperial palace, where we witnessed Emperor Varis meet his death at Zenos's hand. Being the sole witnesses to this crime, and in no position to defend our innocence, we were then forced to flee, each pursuing his own avenue of escape. When we were later reunited, Estinien claimed to have encountered an unfamiliar kind of machina during his flight. But to me, his description seemed anything but. And upon further investigation, I found that I was right. The Empire is developing a new Ultima Weapon.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** What? That Allagan monstrosity? Created to vanquish primals? ...With which you yourself once thought to conquer Eorzea?

**KRILE:** The same. In my foolishness, I sought to harness its power─and became the Ascians' pawn in so doing. But you know as well as I how that tale ended. The Weapon itself, excavated from beneath this very city, was destroyed ere we could fully unravel its secrets. And that should have been the end of it. But, unlikely as it sounds, the Empire's efforts to recreate it have somehow borne fruit─primarily through secret research conducted by the VIIth Imperial Legion, it would seem.

**SHADOWHUNTER:** Wait. The VIIth was all but annihilated at Carteneau─along with its legatus.

**MAXIMA:** Indeed, few survived. The VIIth as it is now has little in common with the legion led by van Darnus, and its leadership has changed hands several times since. Precisely how this project has continued despite such turmoil, and under whose auspices, remains a mystery. What we do know, however, is that a number of prototypes have been produced...and that one of them is on its way to Eorzea. We attempted to stop it, but it was all we could do to slow its progress. So we resolved instead to bring you warning.

**RAUBAHN:** And right glad are we that you did─though it soundly dashed our hopes that tensions might ease at last...

**SHADOWHUNTER:** As it is, we've begun to strengthen our presence in the Ghimlyt Dark, and are assembling a force to meet the coming threat. A force with you in its vanguard, I hope. Before you say anything, I know full well you have pressing concerns of your own. Your comrades remain in peril, and I would not ask you to forsake them. But the fact remains that you and you alone have faced the Ultima Weapon and emerged victorious. We need you. And so, when the time comes─*if* your comrades can spare you─I bid you lend us your strength. I've assigned an officer to await your word.

**MAXIMA:** The Ascians' downfall was to be the work of my remaining days...but it was my hand that kindled these flames, and I cannot allow them to spread any further. I will do what I must to see this mistake consigned to history once and for all...even if it means begging your aid. The fates will enjoy the irony, even as I endure the ignominy.

**KRILE:** I too shall make for the border and offer my skills, meager though they seem in such company. Mayhap we shall meet there anon.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Though we can ill afford to ignore the coming of a new Ultima Weapon, our friends' plight grows ever more precarious, and none save you can join them in the First. I only hope you are not forced to make a choice...

**ALPHINAUD:** Now that we're all here─what news from the Source? Now that we're all here─what news from the Source?

**YSHTOLA:** A new *Ultima Weapon*...? We must count ourselves lucky that Gaius has pledged his assistance.

**URIANGER:** While this is indeed a worrying development, I think the state of the Empire as a whole greater grounds for concern. With the Emperor slain and Zenos returned, it is impossible to predict how matters will unfold in Garlemald. The Ultima Weapon may be but the first of many unpleasant surprises.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** The situation beareth closer observation, of that there is no doubt─and doth compound our need to return unto the Source.

**BEQLUGG:** Then let us address that issue. Our long search for a means to see you safely home may well be nearing its conclusion. Thanks in large part to Urianger and Beq Lugg's invaluable insight, we have succeeded in fashioning a vessel for the journey.

**ALPHINAUD:** We set out to create a crystalline container retaining the more useful properties of white auracite, but without its regrettable limitations. And after a good deal of trial and error, we made one. An ark for soul and mind both, that will allow your incorporeal self in its entirety to be ferried between worlds... A “spirit vessel,” if you will. However...

**URIANGER:** However?

**YSHTOLA:** Though the vessel is possessed of the requisite qualities to hold mind and memory, it wanteth yet for a means to *receive* of them. For that, we must needs imbue it with the Exarch's innate gift.

**URIANGER:** A gift that lives on only through the blood of the Allagan emperors...which certainly does not flow within auracite, or any other crystal.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Just so, milady. The blood serveth as a conduit of sorts─in its absence, memory cannot pass from mind unto mind, nor from flesh unto crystal.

**BEQLUGG:** That being the case, we must either alter the process of inheritance so as to require no such thing, or determine a means by which my blood may permeate the vessel. I am hopeful that the records found within this tower will yield the knowledge we require to pursue one or the other of these avenues.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** As well you should be! The Allagans' body of aetherological research is extraordinary. I can scarce believe it the work of ages past. But its underlying principles are not so very different from those of my own field of study. Given time, we will find the answers we seek.

**LYNA:** I know that you can ill afford to wait, and it pains me that I must ask you to do so. I can only reaffirm my promise to you that a solution will be found. Whatever it takes, I *will* see you safely home.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** My apologies.

**LYNA:** I do hope you haven't come to tell us that mortal peril fast approaches.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** No. I had hoped to speak with the Warrior of Darkness. But there is no need to cut short your meeting on my account. I will be waiting outside.

**ALPHINAUD:** Why not speak in here─she knows I don't mind. Unless she didn't want to...

**LYNA:** Perhaps I might accompany you? Though I am woefully ill-qualified to assist in the Exarch's research, I may yet be of some use to Lyna.

**RESOLUTESOLDIER:** Did you slay this eater? Your orders were to await the main force before engaging.

**LYNA:** No, Captain! It wasn't us, I swear it! A man came out of nowhere and cut it down before we knew what was happening.

**BRAVESOLDIER:** By himself? Certainly it is no Lightwarden, but nevertheless...

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Gallant Guardsman-)It's true! Felled it with a single swing of his axe, he did! Never seen anything like it! (-Gallant Guardsman-)So I says to him, “Who are you, the Warrior of bleedin' Darkness!?” (-Gallant Guardsman-)And he says, “No, I'm a Warrior of Light.” And that was it. Buggered off as quick as he came.

**SOLDIER03608:** A Warrior of *Light*?

**BRAVESOLDIER:** Why would someone go around calling himself that, though? It was those bastards who caused the Flood. I mean, if you were going to pretend to be anyone, it'd be *her*─the Warrior of Darkness!

**LYNA:** (-Gallant Guardsman-)Eh? Oh! I─ I didn't know! It's an honor!

**SOLDIER03608:** Since the eater is no longer a threat, our work here is done. Return to your posts.

**LYNA:** I had hoped to fight at your side today... But I'll continue to follow your example─and may we meet again!

**ALPHINAUD:** I apologize for the wasted journey. It seems I overestimated the threat. As for this “Warrior of Light”... I do not know who would be brazen enough to take that mantle for his own. Whatever it may once have meant, it is forever tainted by the association with the Flood. The Exarch told me the truth of Ardbert and his comrades' deeds, and I am aware they played some part in your own triumph. But to most, they are synonymous with the calamity that befell this world. Still, if this man is minded to destroy sin eaters, I may forgive him his unfortunate choice of alias. But that is neither here nor there. I thank you for accompanying me.

**LYNA:** With that concluded, shall we return to the Crystarium? There is a proposal I should like to make...

**ALPHINAUD:** Forgive me. There is one more thing. A personal concern of mine. I had hoped you might have a moment to speak privately.

**LYNA:** Take your time. I shall go on ahead.

**000:** I will not mince words. This matter concerns the Exarch. Though his countenance belies his age, his demeanor never has. He has seen more than any man should, and grown ever more weary with time... But I see I give the wrong impression. While it is true he attempted to open a letter with his salmon fillet the other evening, we are not here because I suspect his mind is deteriorating. Nor do I believe him to be so maddeningly unconcerned by the prospect of his own death as he once was. Indeed, the opposite is true. It is for this reason that I seek your advice. Since he returned from the Tempest, the Exarch is...not as he was. He seems a different man. A *younger* man. I know not the details of his research, but when I saw him at work recently, there was a glint in his eye that I had never seen before. He looked *happy*. It was as if he had peered into the future, and for the first time, found joy there. Though it gladdens me to see him thus, I wonder if I should not keep my distance. I fear that my presence will only anchor him to the past. Remind him of all the pain that came before.

**LYNA:** What will you say? Anchors keep us where we have chosen to be. He's lost without you, you know. And he misses you already.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...Is that so? He─ Are you sure? Then perhaps we might remain as we were. As we have always been. What a relief. In that case, I will have to speak with him about the amount of time he is spending at work. This research is important, I know, but if he refuses to consider his own health, I will have to consider it for him.

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, this looks to be nearly everyone. Let us begin, shall we? Though I am usually the first to hold forth at such events, I think, on this occasion, that honor should fall to you.

**URIANGER:** They *would* be more inclined to take the word of the Warrior of Darkness.

**SOLDIER03608:** Indeed. In light of the subject matter, who better than thee to speak these truths?

**BRAVESOLDIER:** Wicked white... The Warriors of Light did all that?

**SOLDIER03608:** (-Gallant Guardsman-)So they never─ I mean, they only ever wanted to help? And when everything they'd done turned to ash, they *still* carried on...

**ALPHINAUD:** They gave everything to stop the Flood... First their lives, then their souls... And they managed it, too─in the end. They *saved* us. And we cursed their names.

**000:** This should go a long way towards clearing the air. Impossible...!

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? You can see him too? I take it I'm not imagining this, then.

**URIANGER:** I definitely see *something*. You don't think it's a ghost, do you?

**YSHTOLA:** Nay. Yonder standeth no bloodless apparition, but a Warrior of Light and Darkness both. Ardbert.

**BRAVESOLDIER:** What in the world...?

**DUMMYARDBERT:** (-Gallant Guardsman-)It's you! The one who slew the eater...

**SOLDIER03608:** (-Ardbert-)That it should be the Warrior of Darkness who brought the truth to light... You've saved me a fair bit of time─though I have a few words of my own to say, if I may. (-Ardbert-)People of the Crystarium! I am Ardbert, one of those you know as a Warrior of Light.

**DUMMYARDBERT:** That's impossible! You should be dead...

**BRAVESOLDIER:** (-Ardbert-)Aye, that I should. But as the world has been given new life, so too have I. (-Ardbert-)I know not why I, and I alone, have been gifted this chance. But I do know this: only by the will of the star itself could such a miracle come to pass. (-Ardbert-)The hero who stands before you now─the Warrior of Darkness─is not of this world. And the day will come when she must return to her home. (-Ardbert-)But this land is *our* home. And if it is to remain so, now and forevermore, it is *we* who must protect it. (-Ardbert-)The time to rely on saviors from afar has passed. It is *you* who must rise. *You* who must become the new Warriors of Light!

**DUMMYARDBERT:** (-Gallant Guardsman-)Wha─ Us? Warriors of Light?

**URIANGER:** (-Ardbert-)None of us were born heroes, my friend. I was only ever a man with a thirst for adventure. (-Ardbert-)But wherever my journeys took me, I was invariably confronted with the same choice: to lend what aid I could to those in need─or not. And I always chose the former. (-Ardbert-)Any one of you could do the same. All you need is the will to help your fellow man, and the resolve to see it through.

**ALPHINAUD:** From thine own lips did we learn of Ardbert's fate, and by thy countenance, I gather thou art not inclined to recant thy testimony. Yet whosoever this man may be, his words hold truth─and resonate with the citizenry besides. For us to voice our doubts here and now would serve but to sow disquiet. 'Twere better we retired unto the Ocular, and there discussed this matter in private.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Go. I will stay here and watch.

**BEQLUGG:** So that is a Warrior of Light of the First. I have not had the pleasure of making his acquaintance, but as you all seem to be in agreement, I gather this is no simple case of mistaken identity.

**000:** As far as I was able to discern, that was indeed Ardbert. It has been a long time, but not that long. Could he truly have been resurrected as he claims?

**URIANGER:** What will you say? ...*No*. Absolutely not. It looks like him and sounds like him. But it *isn't* him.

**YSHTOLA:** Ardbert did entrust his very soul unto thee. I see no reason to question thy judgment.

**URIANGER:** Nor I. To my eyes, your aether burns as brightly as the day you slew Emet-Selch. That is proof that he is with you still.

**YSHTOLA:** Yet that which standeth now before the people is far more than a passing imitation. I am reminded of the Cardinal Virtues...though a sin eater he is not. Which leaveth but one plausible explanation.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** That he is an Ascian.

**YSHTOLA:** Given their fondness for posthumous possession, I would have to agree. From what I understand, the Warriors of Light were laid to rest in Eulmore by those whom they had aided in life. At the time, some few still remembered them as heroes. Needless to say, four of them were subsequently exhumed to serve as the Virtues. And if one knew where to look, Ardbert too would not have been difficult to find.

**URIANGER:** Assuming then that this is indeed the work of an Ascian, my mind inevitably turns to the last remaining Paragon to survive the sundering...

**BEQLUGG:** Elidibus. That Zenos hath reclaimed his own flesh is known. Thus evicted from his borrowed form...and cognizant, no doubt, of Emet-Selch's failure here in the First... 'Tis quite possible the emissary chose Ardbert for his next vessel.

**URIANGER:** Inhabiting the flesh of the fallen... My, that is unsavory. And they do this often, you say?

**YSHTOLA:** Verily, for they possess no corporeal forms of their own. In what one may term their natural state, none save those gifted with the Echo can perceive them. Indeed, when Elidibus intruded upon the Waking Sands, his presence did go unmarked by all save Minfilia and the Warrior of Light. On that occasion, I myself remained ignorant of his coming until after his departure. 'Twas only at a later juncture, when he deigned to appear before me in borrowed flesh that I was finally able to take the measure of him. In such puppetry do the Ascians engage when they seek to influence the course of history.

**URIANGER:** And they have gained much by it. Emet-Selch single-handedly built the Garlean Empire in this manner, while Lahabrea came close to conquering Eorzea having taken possession of Thancred's living body.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Yet it must needs be noted that the Ascians cannot avail themselves of *all* mortal vessels. For were they able to do so, none would serve as a better pawn than our own redoubtable champion. Mayhap the blessing of Light shieldeth Hydaelyn's chosen from Ascian influence. Or mayhap other forces are at work. We cannot say for certain.

**YSHTOLA:** Whatever the reason, I hope it holds true. I dare not contemplate what might come to pass otherwise.

**URIANGER:** Is it not peculiar, then, that Ardbert's mortal remains should be susceptible, given that he was once a Warrior of Light? Or did the final departure of his soul make it possible, perhaps? Regardless, to hear an Ascian use him to call forth new Warriors of Light boggles the mind.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Elidibus hath ever been an enigma, his ostensible purpose being to preserve the balance between Light and Dark. When he made overtures towards me, however, I was afforded a glimpse behind the mask of the self-appointed emissary. I shall not defend mine actions, undertaken in pursuit of a better understanding of our foe, as either wise or prudent. Nevertheless, what little I did glean may now prove useful. Elidibus possesseth a subtle mind, practiced in the art of manipulation. That he coaxed this star's most valiant heroes as far as the Source with naught save half-truths is no trifling feat. And now, I believe, he doth employ his skills once more to some as-yet-unknown end. Though naught is certain, should my suspicions prove true, we shall have need of all our wits if we are to uncover─and thereafter thwart─his plot.

**BEQLUGG:** Agreed. 'Tis plain that simply speaking out against him will not avail us. At best, it would only serve to confuse the people. And I would hesitate to do anything which might tarnish Ardbert's reputation once more, nor yours by association. That being the case, it may be wise to keep a covert eye on this “Ardbert's” movements as we attempt to discern his purpose and how best to mitigate his influence.

**URIANGER:** His performance appears to have concluded. What now─go back out and follow him?

**ALMET:** 'Twould appear Master Alphinaud already hath pursuit in mind, and I suspect one pair of eyes shall better serve our cause than half a dozen. Let the rest of us maintain an inconspicuous distance─for the present, at least.

**YSHTOLA:** Come. Our new discoveries are to be found this way.

**CYMET:** The people of Ronka are known to have venerated animals, but these features do not match those of any indigenous species. This is no common beast. Though that much is plain from its proportions.

**UIMET:** Lifelike, is it not? One could almost imagine it breathed.

**CYMET:** Grrr!

**UIMET:** Aaah!

**CYMET:** Hahaha!

**YSHTOLA:** Why, you...

**ALMET:** This owl, by contrast, seems no different from the others we've seen.

**YSHTOLA:** The sealed door lies ahead. As you see, one statue is missing. I expect we are meant to replace it, as before.

**UIMET:** Too simple. There will be some additional defense mechanism. Just a moment─there are words carved into the stone. He...who would disturb...a hero's deserved slumber... Shall instead...waken the beast...and know...his folly... Wait! Don't!

**CYMET:** Wh-What? But I only─ What is happening!?

**YSHTOLA:** Oh no... Oh no, no, no... I-It lives!

**UIMET:** Why am I not surprised? Prepare yourselves! 'Twould seem the magicks have returned us. How polite. Now, what have we learned?

**YSHTOLA:** Oh, we were bound to run into a living statue eventually. And now we can open the door!

**ALMET:** “He who would disturb a hero's deserved slumber...” A tomb, just as I thought. Befitting a hero.

**UIMET:** She is Viis! Could it be the archmage Tiuna? A legendary hero of Ronka, as you surmised. The tales tell of how she smote entire armies with a single incantation, so potent was her spellcraft─though she ever fought in the name of peace.

**CYMET:** I thought them no more than tales. To think she really existed...

**YSHTOLA:** Well, I for one always believed!

**ALMET:** I wonder... By the light...of fallen stars...great power awakens...

**YSHTOLA:** Tiuna was not only a master of spellcraft. It is said she could see truths long lost and hear the voices of men's hearts.

**000:** Naught less than the Echo. In which case...none of this is mere coincidence. A shower of stars setting the sky aflame─and in both this world and the Source, we find individuals within whom a mysterious power awakened at the sight. We could never unpick the why of it. Now, however...I believe we might. Does the scene depicted here not resemble the one we saw when we first ventured into the Qitana Ravel? Moreover, does it not recall that which Emet-Selch invited us to witness in Amaurot? The Final Days. If, as the Exarch's research suggests, soul and mind share a fragile yet profound bond, might it not be possible for an event to leave such a deep imprint upon the soul that it could be perceived eons later─given a suitable trigger? The Echo defies explanation by conventional aetherological theory. Or shall we say, modern aetherological theory. But if it is a power that once belonged to the ancients, to souls yet undivided... ...Ah. It would seem I have entered the realm of pure speculation. And I call myself a scholar. I shall refrain from making any further wild claims until such time as I have evidence. Still, I cannot choose but be reminded of our experience in Amaurot...

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? Then you must recall Emet-Selch's dying request. I will not soon forget it.

**ALMET:** “Remember us.”

**YSHTOLA:** “History is learned, not lived.” We have always protected the tales of Ronka, just as we have protected this place. But we are mindful of what our mothers taught us.  We see the past through our own eyes, and speak of it with our own words. Thus do we come to understand it, in our own way. But this is not the same as remembering.

**THANCRED:** Your mothers were wise. Though we witnessed the Final Days, our impressions could not fail to be colored by our own experiences and expectations. Those who lived through it would have perceived the event quite differently. We must bear in mind that it is no simple matter to keep the truth alive, or it will die with Emet-Selch and his kin. But we have disturbed Tiuna long enough. Fanow will serve similarly well as a venue for our contemplations.

**RYNE:** If you were hoping to vent your frustrations on our eater friend here, I can only apologize.

**ALPHINAUD:** Few as they are now, it took us no time at all to track it down.

**ALISAIE:** That suits our purpose perfectly. Now we need only wait for Ardbert to arrive.

**THANCRED:** Weren't you two meant to be attending to the Empty?

**RYNE:** We were, and are. But we can hardly ignore the rest of the world, so we thought we might see how things were coming along. From what we can gather, the answer is “strangely.” We were indeed, and we've made a certain amount of progress. So we thought we might see how the rest of the world was getting on. From what we can gather, the answer is “strangely.”

**YSHTOLA:** Right now, we think we can do more good here.

**ALPHINAUD:** It is heartening to have all present.

**URIANGER:** Indeed! We will be glad of the additional hands should matters escalate.

**DUMMYARDBERT:** Our quarry is come.

**000:** (-Ardbert-)Hah. It seems I've lost this particular race. (-Ardbert-)Ah, though I suppose it's only fair. (-Ardbert-)When we first met, it was I who outpaced you. Ravana, was it? (-Ardbert-)But where are my manners? I wouldn't be here were it not for you, and I have yet to say a word of thanks!

**DUMMYARDBERT:** What will you do? Extend a friendly fist. Ask whether he wishes Seto were here.

**000:** (-Ardbert-)Arm giving you trouble? You should have it examined. (-Ardbert-)Poor fellow. He will be sorely missed.

**DUMMYARDBERT:** What will you say? Indeed...*Ardbert*. I thought you were supposed to be good at this.

**ELIDIBUS:** (-“Ardbert”-)Very well. Let us forgo this pretense.

**DUMMYARDBERT:** (-“Ardbert”-)Very well. Let us forgo this pretense.

**ELIDIBUS:** (-“Ardbert”-)After all, it was never you that I needed to deceive.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-“Ardbert”-)After all, it was never you that I needed to deceive. Yes, it is I, Elidibus. Through your time in Emet-Selch's imitation of our home, I daresay you have gained a better understanding of my role since last we met. Not that it matters.

**ELIDIBUS:** We understand your role, Emissary, but not your goal. What is it that you seek to achieve?

**ALPHINAUD:** I seek to enact the will of the Convocation, of course. If it helps you to think of me as but another Ascian, no different in nature or purpose from the rest, you are welcome to do so.

**YSHTOLA:** Once, I would have said your goal was destruction alone. Now I understand that you fight for something you love, just as we do. Yet though we seem doomed to clash, I bid you consider Emet-Selch's final words. “Remember that we once lived,” he said. Had he not seen some glimmer of hope in our kind, I do not believe he would have spoken thus. “Remember that we once lived,” he said. Had he not seen some glimmer of hope in our kind, I do not believe he would have spoken thus.

**ELIDIBUS:** None better understood your plight than he. His words must surely be worthy of your consideration.

**YSHTOLA:** Emet-Selch... How very unlike you, to err so gravely. That one should stray at the end of so onerous a path is understandable, but I had thought you above such weakness. Mayhap you thought the same. Would that I had been present to offer correction... But I shall do so now, as is my duty, and return all to its proper course. As for you... Look at yourselves. Look at your *history*. Look back one hundred short years, to how your greatest warriors were undone. And now? At but a word from me, you raise your hands in answer like the puppets you are. Naught has changed. You fail and you fail and you learn nothing─allow that which is most important to slip through your fumbling fingers like so many grains of sand. Again and again and *again*. And you would remember *us*? You do forget yourselves. There is no common ground to be found between you and I. Nor do I require any. I have my duty.

**ALPHINAUD:** Wait!

**ALISAIE:** Well...we have confirmed the identity of our foe, at least. And 'tis safe to say his objective is the Rejoining.

**YSHTOLA:** But we still have no idea how playing the part of a Warrior of Light will further his cause, nor why he would spur others to do the same.

**URIANGER:** Another visit to the Tempest may shed some light upon these mysteries. Whether we are to exchange words or blows with Elidibus at our next meeting, the fact remains: we know too little. Ere our paths cross again, I would learn more of the world that once was─and of Elidibus himself. In this, we would be best served going directly to his home, much as Emet-Selch came to ours.

**YSHTOLA:** Though I see the wisdom in thy suggestion, the Amaurot we visited is but a phantom born of Emet-Selch's memory. I fear it will teach us little that we do not already know.

**000:** I quite agree. Yet the ruins of the actual city remain unexplored. Given the vastness of the Tempest, I should not be surprised were there more such structures like to those in which the Ondo reside.

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? If there's aught to be learned, I want to know. For want of a better option... As long as you don't make me do any more chores.

**ALPHINAUD:** A woman after my own heart. Mayhap your skepticism will leaven my curiosity. Keep that up and I'll send you to bed without supper.

**YSHTOLA:** Assuming we are all in agreement, then, I suggest we first pay a visit to the Ondo. If anyone can tell us where more ruins are to be found, it is them.

**ALPHINAUD:** This structure must have served an important function. And here are yet more crystals...

**URIANGER:** I too noted the crystal repository on the way. The benthos seem to employ them in their spellcasting.

**ANCIENTSA:** In such vessels did the ancients preserve concepts─ideal forms to be drawn upon in the act of creation. That so great an abundance should reside here lendeth credence to Y'shtola's conclusion. This facility held great significance.

**ANCIENTSB:** Thank you all for joining us at Anyder in these most perilous of times. By the summoning of Zodiark have we been granted a reprieve. Yet immutable as the laws He has woven may seem, they will not serve to forestall our doom.

**VENAS:** Nay. Should we continue down this path, our fate will be the same. I said as much to the Convocation, of course, but the stubborn fools turned a deaf ear to my warnings. I had hoped that the defector, at least, would side with us, but I regret to report our overtures have gone unanswered. Whither tend your thoughts, Venat? Where you lead, we will follow.

**YSHTOLA:** I shall not speak ill of the Convocation─they too seek only to secure the future of our star. Yet it is plain they will not countenance a permanent solution. That being the case, we must ask ourselves a simple question: are we prepared to pursue our chosen course, even should it mean suffering the eternal condemnation of our brethren? If so, I see no further reason to demur. Let us bring forth the Light that shall ever after keep the Darkness in check.

**ALPHINAUD:** So...it was they who first summoned Hydaelyn.

**URIANGER:** Their discussion did seem to imply as much, yes. I cannot say I have ever heard of this “Venat” before.

**YSHTOLA:** For a certainty, Emet-Selch never uttered the name, speak though he did of the schism which Zodiark's advent wrought upon mankind. Some were of the viewpoint that His power must needs be restrained, and to that end did they call forth She who would serve as His shackles. We know now that it was this Venat to whom they looked for leadership.

**ANCIENTSA:** And that this place, in all likelihood, served as their headquarters. The presence of such intimate records attests to that. I would hear what else they have to tell us. All of it. Did anyone see the source of the image? The device there? Then let us see what other secrets it holds.

**VENAS:** Venat, please... Why must it be you? If I may speak plainly, I would sooner it were another─*any* other. You are our *leader*. None can take your place.

**ANCIENTSA:** You know as well as I that but few support our cause. Far fewer than they who place their faith in Zodiark. If Hydaelyn is to stand a chance of opposing Him, I am the only one who might suffice as Her heart. Rest assured, however: I shall not vanish from this world. The form I take shall ever remain my choice.

**YSHTOLA:** ...Then I will press you no more. Only know this...you will be sorely missed. I wonder...is this how the Convocation felt about Elidibus?

**ALISAIE:** What? Forgive me, but did that not strongly imply that Elidibus sacrificed himself to become Zodiark's heart?

**ALPHINAUD:** Seven hells... Then who─or *what*─are we dealing with?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Dare I ask what's going on?

**BRAVESOLDIER:** Ah, excellent timing. For me, in any case. We have a problem. The vast majority of those gathered here are presently in the employ of the guard or else one of the facets...and no longer wish to be so. In principle, all are free to change vocation at any time─but a city does require a certain number of people in these positions if it is to continue to function. For the moment, I have asked them to postpone their resignation until such time as replacements can be found. As you may have surmised, we have the “Warrior of Light” to thank for this...

**SOLDIER03608:** It's you! The Warrior of Darkness! You understand, don't you? Someone's going to have to look after this place once you're gone. We just want to be ready to do our bit when the time comes.

**000:** And not only here, but everywhere! Which is why we've got to get out there, and lend a hand to those in need. That's what you did, isn't it? Even if it was just little things, at the start. You helped people.

**SOLDIER03608:** What will you say? People, chocobos, you name it. Well, yes... ...

**ALPHINAUD:** And we're trying to do the same! We may have our sky back, but there's no shortage of people who still need help. Strong and silent─just as a hero should be! You let your actions speak for you, and we mean to do the same. We might have our sky back, but there are still people who need help. If we follow in your footsteps, then I choose to believe we too can be heroes one day. Even Warriors of Light.

**URIANGER:** What are we to say to that? We can hardly tell them they are mistaken. They seek but to do good, as you have.

**FEARFULCITIZENA:** But no more can we stand idly by and suffer a Paragon's scheme to proceed unchallenged.

**FEARFULCITIZENB:** What...what's happening to the sky?

**CRYSTARIUMCITIZENA:** Aaah!

**CRYSTARIUMCITIZENB:** Wicked white!

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh no!

**URIANGER:** By the Twelve...

**HYDAELYN:** A starshower...

**SOLDIER03608:** Hear... Feel... Think...

**BRAVESOLDIER:** I─ I hear a voice!

**CRYSTARIUMCITIZENC:** You and all? Then why does it feel like it's inside my head!? Hear... Feel... Think...?

**CRYSTARIUMCITIZEND:** I hear it!

**DUMMYARDBERT:** Me too!

**SOLDIER03608:** (-???-)Did I not tell you, my friends!? You are Warriors of Light!

**DUMMYARDBERT:** You're back!

**SOLDIER03608:** What you hear is the voice of Light itself, and it has blessed you with its power. Welcome to the fold!

**BRAVESOLDIER:** I'm a Warrior of Light...

**CRYSTARIUMCITIZEND:** I've been chosen!?

**CRYSTARIUMCITIZENC:** Can it be?

**ALPHINAUD:** Me, a hero?

**ELIDIBUS:** Wait! The falling stars─were they your doing? And why do you need Warriors of Light?

**URIANGER:** What, am I to reveal my plans simply because you asked? Nay, I think not─though the stars I acknowledge mine. A convenient illusion apt to awaken what little is left of the power that once resided in your sundered souls. That which you and yours call the Echo. And an echo it is. Of a symphony. But a fraction of what men, in their completeness, once possessed. Even those among you who tower over others in the gift have only the faintest trace of it. But though sundered and forgotten, through death and mocking rebirth, it has persisted. A whisper of our past, burned into your very aether─along with the sight of our end. Through the rekindling of memory, I have awoken the ability─just as Hydaelyn is wont to do when She has need of new minions.

**ELIDIBUS:** The Echo hath ever been thought a gift from Hydaelyn─a boon granted solely to Her chosen. Yet thou wouldst claim She merely awakeneth the power, that men should hearken unto...? Ah. ...Her voice. Given the perceived simultaneity of Her call and the awakening of Her chosen's capacity to hear it, 'tis only natural that we thus attributed the source of the gift. Yet if, in truth, the Echo is a prerequisite for hearing Her voice... One might surmise that Her call never ceaseth, such that all who awaken to their innate gift might receive of the blessing of Light at the selfsame instant. In sooth, we bore witness to this but moments ago. At the sight of the starshower, full many in the crowd did speak of hearing a voice in their minds, did they not?

**URIANGER:** Just so. And whenever Hydaelyn has need of new servants, She is quick to pluck comets from the heavens, or create illusions of the same.

**ELIDIBUS:** Why, then, didst thou conjure this vision, full knowing that thine age-old foe would thus claim those awakened to the gift?

**SYSTEM:** “Foe”? You must be mistaken. As you see, I am a Warrior of Light. And together with my comrades-in-arms, I shall save the world. Just like you.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Meanwhile, in the Crystal Tower's Umbilicus...

**URIANGER:** Foiled again... If I cannot imbue the infernal thing with my power via magical means, we may need to devise a way to infuse the vessel with my blood after all... Ah!

**BEQLUGG:** Art thou unwell?

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Perhaps a brief respite? It wouldn't do to overtax yourself.

**SYSTEM:** I'm fine... And given to stubbornness, I'm afraid. Especially when I have a stake in the outcome.

**ZENOS:** Meanwhile, in the Source...

**MYSTERIOUSCOOPERATOR:** That dream again...

**ZENOS:** A recurring dream? They do so fascinate me. Might I trouble you for the details?

**MYSTERIOUSCOOPERATOR:** I have always dreamed of it... Fire falling from the heavens, and the city─nay, the whole world ablaze.

**ZENOS:** Indeed... Could Emet-Selch have found a way...? Precious few possess memories of the Final Days.

**MYSTERIOUSCOOPERATOR:** The Final Days?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**GAIA:** There's no turning back... Get ready!

**RYNE:** So, this is Ramuh...

**GAIA:** It worked! Both wind and fire have answered the call!

**RYNE:** Ryne! Are you all right!?

**GAIA:** So many of them... But nothing we can't handle! I call...upon the power of Shiva! Aaaaaahhh!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**LAHABREA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Why am I...? Was it you who called me here?

**ELIDIBUS:** (-Convocation Speaker-)On behalf of the Convocation, I bid you welcome to our order. (-Convocation Speaker-)At times you will stand with us. At times you will stand against us. All that you might steer mankind and the very star upon their true course. (-Convocation Speaker-)For yours is the seat of Elidibus, the emissary, and by this name shall your every action be guided.

**000:** So you peered into my memories... No matter. You will have found little of import. But I see you intended to summon me here no more than I intended to come. The fault is mine. Such is the burden of hope...

**ELIDIBUS:** What will you say? Give back Ardbert's body. Why must you embroil the people in your plans? What are you plotting?

**DUMMYARDBERT:** What fool would relinquish his weapon on the eve of battle? I merely avail myself of such tools as I require for the conflict to come. Come now, my plans are no mystery. That which I do is no different from that which you have done so many times, Warrior of Darkness. I arm myself. I hone my skills. I make ready to vanquish my enemy─you. You who have murdered my brothers─who have taken their selfless labors in service to the one true world and turned them to ash. I see you for what you are. You are death, and only in death shall you serve any purpose. The Convocation charged me to steer mankind and the very star upon their true course. As Elidibus, it is my duty. And I shall see it done. I will strike you down... Destroy you body and soul. All else must wait.

**ELIDIBUS:** Destroy you body and soul. All else must wait.

**000:** Ere long I will come for you, Warrior of Darkness. And I will save the world. One last matter. I bore witness to your final struggle with Emet-Selch. It seemed as if he saw something familiar in you. As if he mistook you for another.

**ELIDIBUS:** What will you say? Hythlodaeus called me his “new old friend.” ...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...No. I recall not of whom he spoke. Keep your counsel, then. You spare me further frustration. As often as we have met, you have never once awakened any memory within me. Mayhap I never knew you. Or mayhap it is another fragment lost.

**ELIDIBUS:** (-???-)Ah, I wasn't aware you already had a guest. If the conversation is constructive, I shall not intrude. But if you seek to stir up trouble, Elidibus, then I must insist you leave at once. No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Though you lack Her blessing, your soul is surprisingly dense... Hmph.

**RYNE:** Worry not, I seem to be unharmed. Oh, this... This is my own doing─the consequence of my recent exertions. It is the tower's way of compensating me for the demands I have placed on it. Rest assured, it is no great inconvenience at present. Indeed, I told Beq Lugg as much...but they would not be persuaded, and sent me away to rest. No need to make a fuss. Strange as it may sound, I consider it something of a badge of honor. One of the brave souls who saw me delivered unto the First once said... That the world shall ever have a place for tales of heroism, so long as we have need of inspiration in our lives. Though he and his fellows had no way of knowing whether their mad scheme would amount to anything, they knew that the attempt alone would inspire hope. Or so they hoped. A more optimistic lot, one would be hard-pressed to find. They said they would find a means to save our godsforsaken world─just as soon as they had sent me on my way. Said it with such confidence that, for a fleeting moment, I half-believed them. Such faith, such courage in the face of unrelenting despair. For a long time, it was more than I could bear to remember them. But having come this far─having sent full many on their way myself─I see things more clearly. To take action is to hope. To believe─to *choose* to believe is to take the first step towards a brighter future. And why do I tell you this? Because I want you to indulge me in a little recklessness. Needless to say, I have a plan. And...when all is said and done, I will ask yet another favor of you.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** You're both here! Thank goodness!

**RYNE:** What's wrong?

**TATARU:** It's Thancred! He's collapsed!

**KRILE:** Excuse us... This way.

**TATARU:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. No subtitles. Report if displayed. I would rather you hadn't seen this.

**KRILE:** I'm sorry. We have urgent tidings...

**ALPHINAUD:** No, no, I'm not angry with you. On the contrary. I know full well how hard everyone has been searching for a way to return home. And I had hoped to afford you the time you needed.  But given our friends' present state, perhaps it was for the best that you came. Stiff and cold, all of them. As if they were made of wax. Barely alive at all. And they had been doing so well. Save for occasional signs of aetheric instability, they appeared to be in passable health. Then, quite without warning, things took a turn for the worse. A change for which even Master Matoya could offer no explanation. She could only remind me that the soul is yet an unknown frontier, and that much and more lies beyond our ken. But let's not lose heart just yet. At times like these, it is all the more important that we remain positive. Why, I but this moment succeeded in quelling a fluctuation in Thancred's aether. And while the others have weakened, they have remained relatively stable. I believe I may leave my post for a moment. So come, let me hear your tale outside.

**THANCRED:** Forgive the delay.

**URIANGER:** We have visited every region and confirmed the presence of Ascians throughout the realm.

**THANCRED:** Lest a grave predicament be made to seem hopeless, it should be noted that they are of inferior rank. The black-masked minions who answer to the red.

**ALISAIE:** Yes. A gaggle of schemers attempting to exploit recent events to sow the seeds of petty conflict. Fortunately, nothing of any great concern has come of their meddling just yet.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** We also encountered a number of the Crystarium's former defenders, busily solving this problem and that in a bid to become Warriors of Light.

**THANCRED:** Their zeal is to be applauded. 'Tis but a pity I cannot encourage them on their course...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Not knowing Elidibus set them upon it, no. Both the troubles to be solved and the villains to be vanquished are his doing too, like as not. And so, with apologies to the aspiring Warriors of Light, I believe it best that we deal with the Ascians quickly and quietly.

**ALPHINAUD:** I quite agree.

**000:** But tell us, what news from the Source? How fare our bodies?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Uh...well enough─though time is not on our side. I'm sorry, but...things have taken a turn for the worse.

**ALISAIE:** Indeed. Heartening though it is to know we can stay awhile longer, returning home must remain our priority.

**ALPHINAUD:** This seems an appropriate moment to ask about the spirit vessel. Have you made any progress?

**ALISAIE:** ...Oh dear. Then we must redouble our efforts! Not that we have ever stinted in that regard...

**BEQLUGG:** This would seem an appropriate moment to ask about the spirit vessel. Tell me you've made some progress.

**URIANGER:** We have, as it happens. One moment.

**BEQLUGG:** The red stones... Then this doth mean...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** For the benefit of all, permit us to explain. As you will recall, using white auracite as our starting point, we fashioned a vessel for mind and memory both. Yet though it served this purpose admirably, the process of imbuing it with one's complete essence proved a somewhat thornier proposition. Simply put, the memory would not accompany the mind. And so we looked to the Allagans' mastery of memory transference for a solution.

**ALISAIE:** This approach was not without its own complications, however, relying as it does upon blood─which inanimate objects notably do not possess. We duly explored methods of suffusing the vessel with drops of the aforementioned. Alas, our painstaking experimentation succeeding only in making me feel faint, and singularly failed to imbue the crystal with the necessary properties. It was then that an idea occurred to me: namely, that we might fuse the vessel not with normal blood, but with my crystallized essence.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** You're doing this for our sakes, so far be it from us to complain... But don't think we haven't noticed what's happening to your arm.

**BEQLUGG:** It falls well short of offering up my life in exchange for yours─which was your only stipulated prohibition, as I recall. And it is but a small price to pay for delivering you home.

**THANCRED:** Assuming it works. We shall soon know if this grisly addition will serve as a suitable conduit for the subject's memory. Though...not soon enough to warrant your waiting. The test is like to take a while.

**ALISAIE:** Let us be off, then. We have Ascians to attend to, among other things.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Forgive me, but I count *six* vessels. And there are only five of us.

**ALISAIE:** One is for testing purposes. I will personally use it to see whether the crystal functions as it should.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And...if it does, wouldn't that mean that your soul could also return to the Source?

**ALISAIE:** Yes. In theory, at least. But there is a distinct difference between your circumstances and mine. While your corporeal forms want for souls, my past self does not. Mayhap our essences would blend. Or mayhap they would curdle. There is no telling what might occur.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** And you'd be willing to take that risk?

**ALISAIE:** I would.

**ELIDIBUS:** I see.

**LAHABREA:** Excellent. I had intended to speak with you alone. None of my doing, lest you misunderstand. The link between her body and soul wavers. I know not what you hoped to find here, but it will avail you naught to learn of our past.

**IGEYORHM:** (-Convocation Speaker-)Reviewing the records yet again? Really? You worry too much, Elidibus. (-Convocation Speaker-)This dedication to your duty verges on obsession.

**ELIDIBUS:** (-Convocation Member-)To think some thought you ill-suited for the role. How wrong they were. (-Convocation Member-)But come, turn your gaze outside the window, my friend. The rains have ceased, and we have been graced with another beautiful day.

**YSHTOLA:** It fades. Fades away into oblivion. Does the world no longer have need of me? No. I am Elidibus. And I must─I *will* fulfill my duty. Sundered though you may be, you fought for the world's salvation. For hope. Hope... Ahhh, it swells within me. Empowers me. Now─*now* I may carry out my mission. And yet... Why do I yearn for this? Why do I struggle so? I shall take her into my safekeeping. If you want her back, you will do as I ask. Show me your strength. I would take your measure. I have prepared a suitable arena. You need but ride the flow of aether. You have grown stronger since last we fought. The result of your trials in the First, no doubt.

**ELIDIBUS:** (-???-)Have you finished? My apologies. I freed myself as soon as I awoke, but rather too late, I see. Now, Elidibus, if you have ceased trading blows, I would trade words with you. I have a theory, you see─one concerning that which you seek to accomplish. It stems from who─or rather *what*─you truly are: a primal. The ancients created Zodiark to deliver the star from destruction. If the magick that brought Him forth is the precursor of what we know as summoning, then Zodiark would have been instilled with a presiding desire... I found it among the records at Anyder. And it came as no surprise. Were I faced with the world's destruction, I too would wish for the same... Salvation. I know that you sacrificed yourself to become Zodiark's heart. How you came to be separated from Him is less clear... But if you are a fragment of His being, it stands to reason a desire for the world's salvation would drive you. And thus did you seek to inspire the masses to rise up as Warriors of Light, going so far as to use Ardbert as a symbol of hope.

**YSHTOLA:** Correct on all counts. Such is my nature, and such are my methods. I have aided heroes. I have made them. I have even become them. This served not only to strengthen me, but also to facilitate the work of my brothers, such as Emet-Selch, with his penchant for nation building.

**ELIDIBUS:** Then you will be all too familiar with the fickleness of mankind. We change. We forget. And what little we do remember becomes twisted and fragmented over time. For which reason, you deem us unfit to carry on your legacy. But are you yourself free of these foibles? As the last witness of the Final Days, do you remember *everything* that was lost? Or even the things you cared about?

**YSHTOLA:** Get to the point.

**ELIDIBUS:** A primal is shaped by the hope that fuels it. Even should this hope be something as simple as the world's salvation, it is the collective desire of innumerable disparate souls crying out for deliverance. Having drawn your strength from such a cacophony of voices, can you truly be sure you still speak with your own?

**EMETSELCH:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Your question is irrelevant. No matter how much I should change, no matter how much I should forget, I shall ever remember my duty. At times I stand with my brethren. At times I stand against them. All that I might steer mankind and the very star upon their true course. For Elidibus is my name. And my mission. Guiding my every deed. But enough talk. You have shown me sufficient proof of your might. As I am now, I would struggle to defeat you. Yet I have still to play all of my cards. If I could offer you some semblance of sport, your lessers would pose no threat to me. Would you not agree, Warrior of Darkness?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Gone is the brilliant radiance of life, replaced by the sickly glow of malformed creatures. Is this to be how it ends? For we who loved the star with all our being? No. I will not suffer it to be so.

**000:** (-???-)Well, well. We meet again, my new old friend.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** What will you say? Hythlodaeus. The, uh...receptionist at the Bureau of the Secretariat?

**YSHTOLA:** How good of you to remember. Chief of the Bureau of the Architect, in fact. Where I also answered to the name of “Hythlodaeus.” Heh heh... I see you have been collecting stars. I speak of those crystals. They have constellations etched upon them, yes? High in the heavens, those stars shine their guiding light down upon the lives below. Fitting symbols for the Convocation of Fourteen, would you not agree? As you will have gathered, each crystal bears an account of the life of a member of the Convocation as remembered by the unsundered. Lest you worry, they aren't concepts; they are far too incomplete to be so. But they suffice for imbuing memories within sundered souls, that they might be restored to their office. Keep them. I am sure Emet-Selch wouldn't mind. So, how fare you of late? You are feuding with Elidibus this time, I believe? Hm... I shall refrain from passing comment on your struggle. It is not my place to do so, long-departed as I am. But if I may give voice to a personal desire...I would rather you lived. If you do not, how will you keep your promise to Emet-Selch? The promise to remember? It must weigh heavy, the burden of all those memories. To one who has lived a life such as yours, I can well imagine how Elidibus's existence might seem hollow─how empty his single-minded pursuit of a half-forgotten cause must appear... But know that his devotion is not without reason. Even if he himself can no longer remember what that reason is. Well, that is quite enough talk about Elidibus. I would see if you can reunite the wayward stars. I mentioned before that there was a member of the Convocation who opposed Zodiark's summoning and defected. One whose office was left vacant... Defectors having been deemed unworthy of commemoration, no crystal exists for the individual in question. ...Or shouldn't exist, at any rate─and wouldn't, had a friend not created one in secret. A crystal bearing the forgotten name of her office, along with a magick of her own conceiving─a singular incantation embodying her spirit. Among all the offices, the Fourteenth was most unusual. For while the rest sat in Amaurot, its holder was charged with gaining an intimate knowledge of the wider world. In the course of his duty, he traveled the length and breadth of every land, and befriended countless folk. In the course of her duty, she traveled the length and breadth of every land, and befriended countless folk. She encountered troubles too, of course. Matters which she could simply have referred to the Convocation. But that was not her way. Nay, more often than not, she would call upon her comrades, and together resolve matters themselves. Such is the magick sealed within that crystal─the magick to summon the stars to your side. In time of greatest need, should you wish upon it with all your heart, it will surely answer your call. And now it is where it belongs. Oh, there is no need for thanks. But nor will I hear any complaints about it either. After all, I cannot say whether I act of my own volition or by the will of my recreator!

**CHAINUZZ:** I was wondering where you had disappeared to. Is something troubling you? ...No? Very well. I have everything. Let's hurry back to the surface. Forgive us our lateness. Master Chai, my congratulations on your appointment. By all accounts, you are a capable mayor.

**YSHTOLA:** Oh, I have capable friends, my lady. I must say, it's good to see you looking hale and whole again.

**THANCRED:** The credit for that lies with my own capable friend, without whom I might never have escaped my abductor.

**ALPHINAUD:** A primal... I suppose that would explain why Elidibus has been fostering faith in the Warrior of Light. While you were enjoying your audience with the wandering heart of Zodiark, we were busy dispatching the last of the black-masked Ascians. A task which proved almost insultingly easy. Formidable though we undoubtedly are, they were obviously sent to provide encouragement for budding heroes. One cannot help but wonder how many times the ploy has been used before...

**CHAINUZZ:** Master Chai, you mentioned that the people of Kholusia are similarly enamored of the Warrior of Light.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. Though it's hardly surprising given the state of the world. Many are still struggling to find a purpose, and it's only natural that they should take comfort in the tales.

**DULIACHAI:** Then the fever has spread to every corner of Norvrandt. We may have dealt with his black-masked minions, but it is plain Elidibus has yet to show his hand.

**ALISAIE:** Oh my, what a spectacular sky!

**RYNE:** Another starshower...

**EULMOREMANA:** Wait, is that... ...Amaurot?

**HYDAELYN:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**EULMOREMANA:** Hear... Feel... Think...

**EULMOREMANB:** Did you hear that? That voice, calling out...

**ALPHINAUD:** No, I didn't hear anything. But... Why do I feel so... Like I've lost something dear to me...

**WARRIOROFLIGHTAVATARS:** Does Elidibus seek to awaken more people to the Echo with clearer visions of the Final Days?

**THANCRED:** In the name...of the Light...I shall vanquish...the Darkness... I shall deliver the world from its doom!

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. And who might you be!?

**YSHTOLA:** Whoever they are, they've come for our heads! No you don't! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**URIANGER:** They are not of flesh and blood.

**THANCRED:** I know this magick. The rings are like unto those that the Exarch did employ in our summoning.

**URIANGER:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Are you saying the Exarch is summoning them?

**RYNE:** Nay. Yet the similarity can be no mere coincidence...

**YSHTOLA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Should we make a stand here? Or retreat to the Crystarium?

**CHAINUZZ:** The aether churns around us. More of them will appear ere long. To stay would only place innocents in harm's way. We must fight this battle elsewhere.

**YSHTOLA:** Wait! Take one of our airships! You can decide what to do on your flight to the Crystarium!

**ALPHINAUD:** You are a capable leader in your own right, Master Chai. The citizens of Eulmore chose well.

**RYNE:** It's settled, then. To the airship!

**THANCRED:** I think that's the last of them...

**ALISAIE:** Apparently, even they have limits. Nevertheless, we should remain vigilant.

**URIANGER:** Urianger, something occurred to me while we were fighting. These enemies...

**ALISAIE:** ...Are heroes hailing from other shards, summoned hither to deliver this world from its doom. Scant moments after the starshower did they appear─as yet more souls were inspired to walk the hero's path, no doubt. Thus did hopes for salvation of realms near and far resonate and converge...lending still greater strength unto our adversary.

**ALPHINAUD:** So that's Elidibus's game. But first things first: if the rings are the same as the Exarch's, then we need to ask him how that's possible.

**YSHTOLA:** The Crystarium is close. Let us press on.

**THANCRED:** They come!

**RYNE:** So near and yet so far.

**THANCRED:** “In the chaos of conflict, one can always find an opening to exploit.”

**YSHTOLA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Whoever taught you that is a wise man indeed. And good with a gunblade. But yes, I daresay we can create an opening wide enough for at least one of us to slip through. That being you, of course─though others are welcome to follow in your wake. Ryne and I will keep our guests occupied.

**URIANGER:** Brave and selfless as ever. Yet the two of you may struggle to fool our foes, aetherically sensitive as they are. Had you a comrade who could use destructive magicks to wreak havoc upon the ambient aether, on the other hand...

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Very well, I too shall assist in the diversionary effort.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, not this old dance again... Yes. Obviously, I'll stay and fight. Alphinaud! I'm about to do a great many stupid and reckless things. Watch my back, would you?

**000:** And there you have it. Take care of yourself, my friend.

**RYNE:** What will you say? Make it a nice big opening, eh!? You don't have enough lives for this... Use your magic sparingly, do you hear?

**YSHTOLA:** We'll do our best!

**ALPHINAUD:** Rest assured I have no intention of expending any of mine this day.

**ALISAIE:** I shall not overexert myself without good reason. As for the others...

**SYSTEM:** Finished? Then let's begin! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** A short while earlier, in the Ocular...

**BEQLUGG:** ...'Tis done.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Let me see! Let me see! Yes! Your memories are preserved safely within! We've done it! We've done it at last!

**BEQLUGG:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. I have inspected the other vessels. They are all ready to receive of our friends' memories.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Excellent, excellent! I shall have my familiars bear word to them at once!

**ELIDIBUS:** Elidibus...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** It was not until I observed the battle between Emet-Selch and the Warrior of Darkness that I realized what I must do. I will summon heroes from other worlds unto the First, just as you did. Their presence shall serve to empower me─granting me the strength to crush my enemy.

**ELIDIBUS:** Though it pains me to disappoint you, I feel compelled to explain that the magick in question requires no small amount of preparation.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** Ah, but you assume I require my champions to be summoned in their entirety. I do not. Their souls needn't even be whole. My purpose requires no more than their burning desire to vanquish evil. This I shall sear upon the aether, raising thereby an army of phantom heroes, to whom I shall whisper, as I have to so many over the ages... “Here lies darkness. It must be destroyed.”

**ELIDIBUS:** And you expect me to cooperate?

**BEQLUGG:** I do not require your cooperation. Your death will suffice. The magick, I shall have from your corpse.

**ELIDIBUS:** Go, Lugus! We must flee! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** ...But what is this?

**BEQLUGG:** (-???-)Argh... Unnngh... My friend... How did you...? No matter... Elidibus... He took us unawares... No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** It was all we could do...to raise a ward to hinder his steps... And so we fled... But he took it... The vessel with the Exarch's memories... Forgive me... Forgive me...

**000:** The vessel bears not only my memories, but my blood─the blood of Allagan royalty...granting him the means to control the tower. With it, he has performed I know not how many summonings, calling forth heroes from across the rift. And as you can see, the burden upon the tower is beginning to tell...

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Leave him to me. I'm just glad you're alive. Make sure you stay that way.

**BEQLUGG:** No. I won't let you go alone. Not this time. If you mean to face him alone, I will not allow it. Not this time. No subtitles. Report if displayed. Elidibus has exploited the people's nobility. Twisted their purest intentions for terrible ends. And I cannot let it stand. As Exarch, it is my duty to protect them. To defend their hopes and dreams. So I'm going to the Crystal Tower, with or without your blessing─though I would rather it were with. Thank you.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** I'd join you...but I would only be a burden. Better that I remain here with my gremlins...

**ELIDIBUS:** I shall send help. Stay strong, my friend, and take heart. By binding Elidibus within the tower, we have done more than simply delay him. Much like our adversary, I am not wont to show my hand prematurely. But the time has come to bring my strongest card to bear. To the tower! Not here either. We must keep climbing. No subtitles. Report if displayed. No subtitles. Report if displayed. 'Twas but a matter of time... I cannot keep up with you. Nor will it avail us to make a stand here. You must go on without me. Find Elidibus, and stop him. Worry not, my friend. Though I am no warrior, I have learned to hold my own over the years. When first we explored this tower, you and your fellow adventurers formed the van, while I was left to follow in your wake. Suffice it to say, I was not best pleased with the arrangement. How I wished that I could join you... And now I have, here where it all began. I was right to trust in you and the power of your legacy─of your name. To let them guide my every deed.

**000:** For Elidibus is my name. And my mission. Guiding my every deed.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? Why me? Did you never consider other paths?

**ELIDIBUS:** Why you? Why *not* you? Had I chosen another, we would never have made it this far. Or do I mistake your meaning...? I did─but I chose not to walk them, thank the gods. Why ever would you ask me such a thing? ...Elidibus spoke in similar terms, you say? How curious. To answer your question, then, I made my choice for reasons which seemed obvious to me, but may not to any other. There were the expectations I placed upon myself before beginning my slumber. And the expectations of those who roused me. Of course, I had the choice to turn my back on the lot of it. But in the end, it was no choice at all. I cherish the time I spent with you and the others. What I wouldn't give to return to those halcyon days... Chasing ancient secrets, overcoming trial after trial with the aid of like-minded comrades... And what remarkable comrades they were. In such company, I felt as if I were a character in the epic tales that had stirred my heart as a boy. As if my dream had come true... It hadn't, of course, for I was no hero. Neither then nor after. Though the world to which I awakened, and the First were beset with myriad problems, I rarely knew how best to play my part. There was, however, one thing of which I was certain: that I could not bear to let those dear to me meet a tragic end. I'm afraid our time is up. Go. Rest assured you haven't seen the last of me. I wouldn't dream of playing my trump card save in your presence. Break!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Memories of a possible future... Worthless, all. Worthless as memories of the only past. Fated to fray and fade into oblivion. Leaving naught but a gaping void... The Waking...Sands? ...Yes, that was the place. The place I first made myself known to you and yours. The seventh Rejoining had left the realm listing dangerously towards Darkness. And events were unfolding that threatened to push it over the brink. Thus did I approach you, in my capacity as emissary, thinking that you would make a useful pawn... But I was wrong, and for my misstep did Lahabrea and Emet-Selch pay the ultimate price. Leaving me the last of the unsundered. My remaining brethren, fragmented as they are, cannot hope to see our mission to its end. It falls to me alone. Defeat is not an option. I will strike you down. I will resurrect Lord Zodiark. And I will bring back those who sacrificed themselves to call Him forth. Though it take a thousand thousand years, upon my honor as Elidibus, emissary of the Convocation of Fourteen, I will see this done.

**LAHABREA:** But know that his devotion is not without reason. Even if he himself can no longer remember what that reason is.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** (-Convocation Speaker-)You worry too much, Elidibus. This dedication to your duty verges on obsession.

**ELIDIBUS:** What will you say? Those who once relied upon you are no more. However hard you struggle, you will never bring back the Convocation.

**DUMMYARDBERT:** What of it!? I have my mission! I am Elidibus! And it is my duty to steer mankind and the very star upon their true course. This I swore to...to someone. We spoke, and I swore...what? What did I...? No subtitles. Report if displayed. This pain, this torment...is nothing! No more than must be suffered to deliver the world from its doom! No more than any of you malformed creatures have known! Even should you lose all that is dear to you. Even should it cost you your life...

**ELIDIBUS:** Even should you lose all that is dear to you. Even should it cost you your life...

**DUMMYARDBERT:** You bear the burden and fight on, kicking and screaming until your last breath is spent!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** You bear the burden and fight on, kicking and screaming until your last breath is spent!

**000:** (-Voice from Within-)Aye, it's true. We've lost much and more. Known unimaginable suffering. (-Voice from Within-)But through it all, we never, ever forgot what was dear to us. And that's what gave us the strength to carry on.

**ELIDIBUS:** Elidibus... You've no fight left to fight. I will put an end to this.

**EMETSELCH:** No! NO! It will not end here! Champions from beyond the rift, heed my call! The time is come to deliver your brethren from darkness! My heart's sole desire is a world free of sorrow. Join with me now in hope and prayer...for the salvation of all! (-Elidibus-)If you would usher in the end, then with my all shall I oppose you... (-Elidibus-)...As the avatar of those mortal heroes who fought unfalteringly, in all their imperfection! As the Warrior of Light incarnate! Come, Warrior of Darkness! Let us finish this! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ELIDIBUS:** Herein I commit the chronicle of the traveler. Shepherd to the stars in the dark. Though the world be sundered and our souls set adrift, where you walk, my dearest friend, fate shall surely follow. For yours is the Fourteenth seat─the seat of Azem.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** An invocation of eld...though not of Hydaelyn's making... What are you? No─it matters not! You are the enemy, and you will fall! Even should it cost me everything, I will not forsake my duty! Fool! You have achieved nothing! I am immortal, and I will never surrender! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ELIDIBUS:** Elidibus. So fixated were you on my memories of the future, you failed to heed the lessons of the past. Your obsession blinded you to the true nature of this tower─this beacon of hope for mankind. Created to serve as a reservoir for the limitless energy of the heavens! To harness and bind the boundless─not unlike white auracite! Your ill-begotten power, obtained by exploiting that which is best in us... I shall have it, your soul and all!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. This... Yes... I would become Him. I would save everyone. This I believed. Yet still they cried out, in rage and despair... Divided─over the fate of the star. A rare occurrence, always fleeting. But not this time. Not this time... Reconciliation. Elidibus. I was needed. I withdrew myself from Zodiark. For them... My people. My brothers. ...My friends. Stay strong. Keep the faith. At duty's end, we will meet again. We will. We will. The rains have ceased, and we have been graced with another beautiful day. But you are not here to see it.

**000:** I concede, I may have overexerted myself. Steady now, and listen. I told you before that I had a plan, and that when all was said and done, I would ask a favor of you. We have averted the Eighth Umbral Calamity. Found a way for everyone to return to the Source, and...last but not least, we have secured the future of all the people of Norvrandt. We have won, my friend. So I hope you'll forgive me this moment of selfishness. And...while I wouldn't want you to feel obliged... Promise me you'll take me on your next adventure. A journey. Together. That's all I ask.

**MYSTERYVOICE:** What will you say? I promise. You could've asked me earlier!

**RYNE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. If I were to tell you that this isn't the end─that we will meet again─would you believe me? Thank you. My friend. With you, my mind and memories shall travel to the ends of the world and beyond. But in this place shall my body stand immovable. May it serve as an undying promise, not only to those who looked to me for leadership, but to any soul who has known despair, that hope is everlasting.

**DULIACHAI:** There the Exarch would remain, keeping his silent vigil. When the Scions were not released from his summoning spell, we proceeded with the plan to return them to the Source. The Warrior of Darkness, however, retained her ability to traverse the two worlds at will. And in time the Crystal Tower became a symbol of his link to the First─and of hope. And in time the Crystal Tower became a symbol of her link to the First─and of hope.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh... Oh, Alphinaud...

**DULIACHAI:** Please, Lady Chai, dry your eyes!

**CHAINUZZ:** The thought of never seeing you again... It's more than my poor heart can bear! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**000:** Oh, it's you. As you can see, Alphinaud has broken the news. I don't know how to console her. She thinks we'll be lost without him.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? You're certainly well loved. Make sure you leave nothing unsaid. A picture paints a thousand words!

**CHAINUZZ:** 'Tis more than I deserve. Yet I am truly grateful, and will see that she knows as much. Indeed, my friend. Nothing unsaid. You'll never let me forget it, will you. I'll have you know I completed the promised painting in the end. Be that as it may, there are times only words will suffice. Lady Chai, I have a confession to make. On the day we ousted Lord Vauthry, when I revealed the truth of his tyranny and your complicity in his crimes, I did so with great trepidation. Not out of fear that you wouldn't listen, but that you might never recover. There was a time when I too, in my hubris, believed myself worthy to lord it over others. And when the lie was laid bare─when I was forced to confront the cost, the lives lost─it all but destroyed me. To awaken from a naive dream to so harsh a reality... I would have understood had you all surrendered to despair. But you didn't surrender. Far from it. You picked yourselves up and rose to the challenge. You found a path forward and the strength to walk it─and to keep walking it─day after day. But what struck me is how much faster you found it than I did.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...Really? It felt pretty slow to me! But rest assured, we'll make Eulmore into a nation anyone would be proud to call home...eventually. You can still come and go as you please, I believe? When we have good tidings to report, I may trouble you to be their bearer. There may also be less-than-good tidings...in which event, I hope I can trouble you for your counsel.

**DULIACHAI:** I should be honored to provide it, Master Chai.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, Alphinaud... I know you aren't one to sit still, but do remember to take your ease from time to time. And no matter where you are, remember that there are people here who are praying for your health and happiness. Our brave and gentle artist. You have our love, now and always.

**SETO:** And you mine. Please take care.

**000:** Is that...Ardbert's crystal? So it is. It has changed...but I would know it anywhere. However did you come by it? ...Then even in death, his enemies found a way to profit from his sacrifice. It grieves me to think of his body being used for evil ends... But thanks to you, his honor is restored, and he may finally find peace. No words can express my gratitude. I will keep this crystal safe to the end of my days. Rest easy, my friend. You have earned it.

**SETO:** What will you say? Tell me, does anything strike you as different about my soul? Close your eyes.

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Your soul? Hm... Pardon? ...Hm! Very well. How can this be?

**SETO:** Seto, my old friend. You've grown!

**WARRIOROFDARKNESS:** Oh! Oh, Ardbert! How I've missed you! I'm sorry I couldn't keep you safe... Or even console you. Had I only learned to speak sooner, I would have told you how much you meant to me. How much I cared.

**SETO:** I knew. I always knew. But I'm happy to hear it nonetheless. Thank you, Seto. My partner in crime.

**RUNAR:** I see... His journey continues. Then I will not yet bid him rest. With you, he may look forward to many more adventures. It has been a while since last I flew. Perhaps I too will go on a little adventure. Ride the winds, seek the horizon... Yes. I think perhaps I will.

**YSHTOLA:** Master Matoya! For too long, I have remained silent. But no longer. I could not bear it if you were to leave. Please stay! I beg of you!

**RUNAR:** Runar... Please...

**YSHTOLA:** ...I jest. At least in part. Ahem. What I came to say is this... Thank you. Without your wisdom, your strength, and your kindness to guide us, our people would still be lost. We will never forget you, Master Matoya. Wherever your journeys may take you, you will always be in our hearts.

**RUNAR:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. And you in mine. Remember that your people's journey─that *our* people's journey is yet ongoing. Your lives will change, and so too will your dreams. Yet come what may, you need not forsake your time-honored traditions, nor less your beliefs. But neither should you be beholden to them. For it was with curiosity and courage that the Night's Blessed first triumphed over adversity. New knowledge and new wisdom are ever worthy of pursuit.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed they are. And so, until we return to the sunless sea, we shall endeavor to live our lives to the fullest.

**RUNAR:** That is well. But however great your strides, there may yet come a day when the challenges you face cannot be surmounted alone. On such a day...

**YSHTOLA:** On such a day?

**RUNAR:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. You may call on me. Since a means to travel between worlds exists, you can be sure I will find a way to employ it. And there remain so many mysteries here that want for solving.

**YSHTOLA:** Master Matoya!

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**URIANGER:** That's everyone, then. We've all said what we needed to.

**RYNE:** Even as we speak, Beq Lugg undertaketh their final inspection of our spirit vessels. When thine own preparations for the journey are complete, thou art to present thyself in the Ocular.

**URIANGER:** Um...everyone? I want to thank you all. On behalf of the First. You, and Minfilia, and the Exarch. Without each and every one of you guiding us, fighting for us...we wouldn't be standing here now. There wouldn't even *be* a here. And no words can express our gratitude. We still have a lot to do, countless trials to overcome─but if it ever seems too much, I'll think of our time together. The happy moments...and the sad─I will remember it all. And it will give me the strength to carry on without you. Because you made me who I am. Minfilia. Ryne. To honor these names and these memories, I will stand with all the people of this land, and strive for a better tomorrow.

**THANCRED:** Thancred. I believe the honor of responding should rightfully be thine.

**RYNE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. I know better than most how much you've grown, and I have every confidence you'll make your people proud. Gods know, I'm proud of you. I always will be. You deserve all the happiness in the world and more.

**LYNA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Might we also say a few words?

**LYNA:** Why, this is...just about all of you!

**ALISAIE:** To see you off seemed the least we could do. You risked your all for us─fought for a realm not your own. Before you came, we had never known the beauty of the night sky. Or the joy of your company. Though it saddens us deeply to bid you farewell, it has ever been our way to send off friends with a smile. Wherever your road should lead, we shall pray for your safety. And following your brave example, we shall continue to fight for the Crystarium.

**ALPHINAUD:** With or without us, you've always taken good care of this city. I don't doubt for a moment you'll continue to do so.

**LYNA:** Aye, a more resilient people we have never known. As resilient and enduring as the tower that watches over you.

**000:** To the last, we did not question the Exarch about his past. It is only now, when he can no longer tell us, that we believe we know the answer. We have heard what became of him, and what is about to be attempted. All will be well, of this we are certain. How could it be otherwise, when every soul in the Crystarium is praying for it with all their heart? And so, when our lord awakens, I bid you give him a message. Tell him he needn't worry about us. That he need no longer hide who he truly is. That he should live his own life to the fullest. And that if he should ever find himself reminiscing on the past with a smile, we shall be smiling with him. Will you tell him this?

**LYNA:** What will you say? Word for word. I'll do my best.

**YSHTOLA:** Thank you. Please look after him for us. I am sure you will.

**BEQLUGG:** I daresay we have all the good wishes we can carry. Let us be on our way.

**URIANGER:** All right, then. Pray proceed as instructed, beginning with your memories.

**ALISAIE:** The first step is complete. And all appeareth to be in order.

**BEQLUGG:** Well, that just leaves our souls, then. We're in your hands, Angelo.

**RYNE:** It is done! The vessels have received of both their memories and their souls! I hereby entrust them to your care. They belong to you now. Just be sure to guard them well, yes?

**BEQLUGG:** This *will* work, won't it?

**RYNE:** Our theories have held thus far. But I make no promises about what is to come. Even the greatest mages in history knew better than to transport a soul across the rift. We, my dear, are in unknown territory. Prepare as we might, we cannot account for all possibilities, and it is in such circumstances that accidents are wont to occur... Yet miracles do happen. So let us pray, and will our friends home.

**BEQLUGG:** I won't stop praying until I know they're safe.

**ALISAIE:** All safely stowed away? I do hope so. All that remains, then, is to step into the mirror. Go now...and safe travels.

**THANCRED:** Did it...? Are we...?

**TATARU:** ...We're home.

**YSHTOLA:** Oh! Oh, you're back! You're back! You're all back!

**URIANGER:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Thank you. My body feels like a sack of popotoes, but otherwise I have never felt better. That said, I doubt any of us will be fit to travel for some while. May we leave the rest to you?

**TATARU:** The vessel beareth our comrade's blood. With it in thy possession, the way will surely open before thee.

**ALPHINAUD:** What!? But you've only just got here!

**MYSTERYVOICE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Tataru, might I trouble you to brew us all a pot of your special tea? Ah! And we may require an extra cup.

**SYSTEM:** Yours is a long road, my friend, and it stretches on to places beyond imagining. With your every step, these grand adventures shall grow more distant and faint. And there may come a day when you forget the faces and voices of those you have met along the way. On that day, I bid you remember this... That no matter how far your journey may take you, you stand where you stand by virtue of the road you walked to get there. For in times of hardship, when you fear you cannot go on... The joy you have known, the pain you have felt, the prayers you have whispered and answered─they shall ever be your strength and your comfort. This I hope─I believe, here at memory's end.

**ALISAIE:** Some days later...

**ALPHINAUD:** [LOW, ANNOYED SIGH]

**ALISAIE:** What is it, Alisaie? Are you all right? Do you still feel under the weather?

**YSHTOLA:** Physically, I couldn't be better. Thanks to Krile's ministrations, I'm already looking forward to our next fight. But seriously─don't you have anything to say about *that*?

**TATARU:** No less impressive than our garments. You've outdone yourself, Tataru.

**THANCRED:** To give credit where it's due, I had help from a certain fiery pixie who visited me in my dreams. They gave me all the information I needed to get the details just right. For your weapons, though, I needed a *lot* more help... Thankfully, our favorite heads of state were happy to place their finest craftsmen at my exclusive disposal. Oh, and speaking of the Alliance leaders, they all express their “unreserved elation at your safe return,” and promise to come and see you in person as soon as they can.

**ALISAIE:** They really needn't have gone to such trouble─but we'll be keeping these gifts all the same. Do pass on our gratitude.

**ALPHINAUD:** I realize we haven't taken up new martial arts, nor have I ever been one to set much store by appearances... But I can't help feeling a certain lack of...I don't know, personal development.

**KRILE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. I quite understand. But as you observed, the others had the more pressing need. Rest assured, our turn will come.

**URIANGER:** If I expend any more aether, I swear I will blink out of existence. I need a bite to eat. Tataru, a cup of tea, if you would be so kind. And something sweet.

**GRAHATIA:** By Mistress Krile's exhausted state, may I assume that the ward hath been restored?

**URIANGER:** (-???-)Indeed. We succeeded in weaving it anew, albeit at a slightly diminished potency than when I had Beq Lugg's assistance. (-???-)It is no cause for concern, though. The tower is not easily reached, never mind breached. And even should some few succeed, their presence won't escape my notice.

**GRAHATIA:** Excellent. Said duty thus discharged, thou art free to go wheresoever thy fancy taketh thee. Upon which note─hast thou perchance come to a decision? The offer remaineth open.

**000:** (-???-)Well...if you're certain that's what you... I-I mean, if you think I...

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? ... G'raha, really.

**UNSETTLEDRESEARCHER:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. No subtitles. Report if displayed. No subtitles. Report if displayed. I accept. Henceforth, I shall count myself a Scion of the Seventh Dawn. G'raha Tia, at your service. When I was a boy, many long years ago, I yearned to stand tall as the heroes of eld.

**ALISAIE:** Help! Somebody help! Hippogryphs! Hippogryphs on the rampage! A giant flock of 'em! Please, we need help!

**ALPHINAUD:** I could do with a little rampage myself.

**GRAHATIA:** What!? Now wait just a─ No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**YSHTOLA:** But like a fool seeking to pluck the stars from the heavens, my every attempt to reprise their deeds fell short... 

**URIANGER:** I will join the fray when I've finished my tea.

**GRAHATIA:** Thus did the avatar of destruction descend, and in her wake leave naught but tears and ash...

**ZENOS:** And then, one day, an all but forgotten dream from my youth stood before me, in the flesh. So it was that a new adventure began...

**FANDANIEL:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. The memory of a dying world's end, night after night... And I thought it but a tired old dream.

**ZENOS:** I say... I knew that securing the palace would provide Your Radiance with depressingly little sport─but that you should fall asleep out of boredom!? Splendid! Truly splendid! And my own preparations, you will be pleased to hear, proceed apace. Oh yes, they proceed very well indeed. Frighteningly so. And we owe it not least of all to this singularly useful body I chanced to find. With the Populares now all but destroyed, it will be the simplest of tasks to discredit their groundless assertions that I met with a grisly end. And as the very-much-alive lord of House Brutus, I have a vast fortune at my disposal. Ahhh, money, money, money! The great motivator! There is simply no better way to move men─and expedite plans─than with its alluring glint, would you not agree? But wait...! Were we not acquainted, you and...“I”? (-White-robed Figure-)Should our familiarity cause you distress, I beg your forgiveness.

**FANDANIEL:** ...What did you say your name was?

**GRAHATIA:** (-White-robed Figure-)Ahhh, a dagger through my heart! That my deepest desire should forever remain unfulfilled! To live unrecognized! To die forgotten! (-White-robed Figure-)So it goes. Whatever this flesh may have been before, it serves only as a vessel now. And I, faithful Fandaniel, labor only to advance my lord's ambitions. Speaking of which, with the palace in our hands, we may now proceed with the next phase of the plan. But how very odd... Despite all our havoc wreaking, old Elidibus did not deign to appear. Dare I hope...? That the last of the unsundered...is gone? No subtitles. Report if displayed. Imagine it! Bound no more by the shackles of moldering memories─of damnable duty! Free at last to live for the moment! Your Radiance. But give the word, and I shall go forth and prepare for you your hunting ground.

**ZENOS:** That which awaited was a fell beast. Ferocious. Ravenous. Remorseless.

**GRAHATIA:** ...Do as you will. It has been too, too long, my friend...and insufferably dull in your absence. When you return to me, you will share everything. Every blow will be a story unto itself. Every triumph. Every kill. Rest assured we shall have a fitting stage for our reunion. Oh, yes. To reprise that transcendent moment, I will set this world ablaze. And we shall dance before the pyre.

**ALISAIE:** [SURPRISED REAX]

**RYNE:** [SURPRISED REAX]

**THANCRED:** [SURPRISED REAX “Ahhh!”]

**ELIDIBUS:** Damn it! Hang on to something!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**THANCRED:** Well, my friends─now that we have all settled back into our bodies, it is time we resumed our duties in earnest. Let us speak of our plans.

**URIANGER:** Ever since the Emperor's death, it's been one unsettling rumor after another. I've a mind to pay a visit to Garlemald to ascertain the truth of the matter.

**YSHTOLA:** A prudent endeavor. 'Tis of the essence that we establish the full extent of the threat. Not least if it should prove that Zenos doth indeed orchestrate events from the shadows. In light of which possibility, I shall accompany thee on thy mission. Be assured that thou shalt find me more a help than a hindrance. Thou requirest another to imbue thine ammunition, dost thou not?

**ALISAIE:** For DE and FR only. Report if displayed.

**LYSE:** Assuming that's settled, there's something I've been meaning to look into as well.

**ALPHINAUD:** Welcome back, everyone!

**LYSE:** Lyse!

**ALISAIE:** You're fine now, right? No more headaches or keeling over?

**GRAHATIA:** That's right. We're fighting fit, and raring to go!

**LYSE:** The famous Lyse Hext...former Scion and hero of the Ala Mhigan Resistance.

**KRILE:** I don't believe we've met.

**GRAHATIA:** Really? It's so easy to assume that all Archons are acquainted. But then I suppose your fields of expertise *are* rather different.

**LYSE:** G'raha Tia, at your service. I have read much and more about your exploits, Commander. It is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.

**ALPHINAUD:** Likewise. The others told me all about you.

**LYSE:** Do not be so sure. Words scarcely do justice to the vital role he played in our victory in the First. A more dependable comrade one would be hard-pressed to find.

**URIANGER:** Ah, right, I did glance at the report...but I'd be lying if I said I understood half of it. Well, well...that's a lot to take in. Um... Just to be clear, this means we're *not* heading for another calamity, does it?

**LYSE:** Shorn of their unsundered masters' leadership, what Ascians remain shall struggle to see their plans to fruition. And though I would ever advise caution, I believe we may rest easy for a time.

**YSHTOLA:** I'll take that as a yes. Even so, I don't know what to make of this business about Hydaelyn and Zodiark being primals...

**ALPHINAUD:** A difficult truth to bear, yes. But at last we understand the nature of our adversary. And if there are no further calamities, neither will there be Rejoinings, meaning Zodiark will never regain His full strength. Even so, as the oldest and mightiest of primals, He remains a force to be feared. Though His is a power born of the desire for salvation, we have seen the havoc it may wreak. And it falls to us to ensure that it is never again brought to bear upon this star.

**LYSE:** But tell us, Lyse, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit? 

**THANCRED:** What do you mean? Isn't seeing my long-lost comrades reason enough? ...All right, there *was* one other matter. I have a message from the Alliance. And before you ask, yes, it's about the Empire. So, after Emperor Varis's assassination, it seems his cousin “Nerva” made a bid for the throne. The trouble is, he wasn't the only one with designs on it, and it didn't take long for a civil war to break out. And it's not just in the provinces. Early reports say huge swathes of the imperial capital have been reduced to rubble. The Alliance will soon convene in Ala Mhigo to decide on a course of action, and we were hoping you'd come along.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well! As it happens, Urianger and I were just this moment planning a little trip to Garlemald. And we should be grateful for any advice the Alliance can provide on how best to make the most of our visit.

**ALISAIE:** To Ala Mhigo, then.

**ALPHINAUD:** Why don't you go on without me. There's something I need to look into.

**ALISAIE:** Ah, forgive me, you were just telling us. What is it, if I may ask?

**ALPHINAUD:** I want to find a way to cure the tempered.

**LYSE:** Of course. You think it may be possible to adapt the treatment you used to help those corrupted by the sin eaters...

**ALISAIE:** I'm sorry? A cure for tempering? But that would change everything! Alisaie─consider yourself uninvited. Go and find us this cure!

**000:** I'll do my best. I was hoping you might join me. Don't worry if not, though─I won't hold it against you if you'd rather attend a stuffy meeting.

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? What meeting? Lead on! I *like* stuffy meetings.

**YSHTOLA:** I knew you'd say yes.

**GRAHATIA:** Rest assured there'll be many, many more. Go on, lend Alisaie a hand.

**YSHTOLA:** I'll come too! ...If you don't mind, that is.

**GRAHATIA:** For DE and FR only. Report if displayed. Mind? I'm sure they would be glad of your company. Pray enjoy your time together with your hero.

**ALPHINAUD:** My...? N-No, that's not─ I mean, I— I-I simply thought my knowledge might be of some use!

**AYMERIC:** We shall be on our way, then. Godsspeed.

**ALISAIE:** My friend. After the disappointment of not seeing you in Ala Mhigo, what good fortune to chance upon you here of all places. As you may have heard, the allied nations are making a renewed effort to address the primal problem. To that end have I invited the chieftain of the Vanu to Ishgard, that we might together plot a course. Since the war with the Empire appears to be nearing its conclusion, I would also like to call upon Estinien's lance. Alas, he is as ever a difficult man to find. I am informed he recently paid a visit to the Rising Stones. Should he happen to do so again, be sure to pass on my regards, won't you. But tell me, what business brings you to our fair city this day? A cure for tempering... You never cease to amaze me. Until now, our only hope has been prevention, our every failure irrevocable. But this─this would rewrite the rules of engagement. It could end the cycle of bloodshed...! Very well. You shall have all the ceruleum we can provide─and an airship with which to transport it. In this matter, you may count on Ishgard's full support.

**CID:** Who would have thought ceruleum weighed so much? Serves me right for being stubborn, I suppose. I should have just done what you did and accepted help.

**GRAHATIA:** Good work, you two. This is all we asked for and more. Quite a lot more, now that I look at it... Lord Aymeric, eh? And entirely by chance? Hah! Some people have all the luck.

**NERO:** We have also succeeded in configuring the terminals─thanks in no small part to our able assistant.

**CID:** It's been a while, hero. You seem surprised to see me. Lest you misunderstand, I've no interest in such things as cures for tempering. But if you mean to achieve that which eluded even the storied Allagans, it seemed plain that you would require my expertise. And so it proved. Is that not right, Garlond?

**NERO:** Ask Jessie. She was the one who hired you. All I know is you're an employee of the Ironworks now, so you'll bloody well earn your keep. For all the effort it took to track you down after your latest disappearing act, you could find the cure for death and it wouldn't be worth the trouble.

**CID:** Ahem. That wasn't the *only* reason I agreed to cooperate. I am reliably informed that Garlond and I are destined to unravel the secrets of travel not only across dimensions, but through time. Doubtless the lion's share of the credit lies with me─nine parts to Garlond's one. And this research will be a stepping-stone to that illustrious achievement.

**NERO:** Very well, then. I'll do a tenth of the work. Just the part that's beyond you.

**CID:** Whatever you say, Garlond.

**WEDGE:** By the way, the healing applications of crystal foci proved very useful in getting us to where we are now. I must remember to thank Mikoto. Right! If everyone's ready, let's begin! All appears to be in order. Now we just have to wait for it to find us our magick. Why not take this opportunity to put your feet up? This may take a while... Damn it. It's overloading!

**CID:** Chief! She won't last much longer!

**GRAHATIA:** We'll have to shut it down!

**CID:** Wait! We're close! So very close!

**NERO:** No subtitles, report if shown.

**GRAHATIA:** Well, this is going swimmingly...

**WEDGE:** Please, a moment longer! I beg you! There! No subtitles, report if shown. I was able to memorize the magick before it faded. It still needs to be put to the proof, but...I believe we have our cure!

**GRAHATIA:** It's just as well. She'll never run again.

**CID:** The fault is mine. I'm sorry.

**GRAHATIA:** Don't be. It may fall short of dimension-hopping, but a cure for tempering is not to be sniffed at. This, my friend, is a world-changing discovery. One we're proud to have had a hand in. A few magitek terminals are a pittance to pay.

**CID:** Thank you.

**MAELSTROMOFFICER:** Well, we've done what we can. The rest is up to you.

**ALISAIE:** Apologies for the wait.

**GABU:** Ga Bu. Have you been good?

**MAELSTROMOFFICER:** ...

**ALISAIE:** Still no change, I'm afraid. He just stands there in silence until we move him.

**ALPHINAUD:** It's all right now. We're going to help you get better.

**ALISAIE:** Fancy meeting you here.

**YSHTOLA:** Alphinaud! Y'shtola! I thought you were attending to primal matters.

**ALPHINAUD:** We were, and came here for a meeting on the subject. Certain pirate factions did not deign to attend, however, and it was canceled.

**YSHTOLA:** We had resigned ourselves to having wasted a journey when we chanced to espy you. Could it be that there has been progress with the treatment? Using magitek terminals to formulate the solution... I would never have contemplated such an approach.

**GRAHATIA:** So this new magick, adapted from memory transference, would be used to purge the subject of their fanatical faith, while Angelo would be responsible for reanimating the aether of their soul... Hm. Yet I wonder at the practicalities. If one were to reanimate the soul first, it would only serve to exacerbate the tempering. Conversely, a stagnant soul would not respond to the effects of the magick. Would both need to be performed simultaneously?

**ALISAIE:** Nothing escapes Master Matoya's inquiring eye! As you say, both must be carried out simultaneously, and thus I propose to imbue Angelo with the tempering treatment in much the same manner as I did the spirit vessels.

**GRAHATIA:** By doing so, we also spare G'raha the trouble of casting spell after spell. It's really rather efficient.

**ALPHINAUD:** Be that as it may, certain difficulties are unavoidable: the imbuing process will still require no small amount of aether. And as I can no longer draw upon the Crystal Tower's stores of energy, I will be compelled to rely on those of others.

**YSHTOLA:** Well, I for one would be glad to assist.

**GRAHATIA:** As would I. Since the resumption of our duties, it has been naught but stuffy meetings, and I have ample aether to spare.

**ALPHINAUD:** Excellent. With your permission, then, let us begin. Yes, this will do! And now it's my turn! 'Tis done...

**GRAHATIA:** “No small amount,” indeed...

**ALISAIE:** Well...we seek to go where even the Allagans did not. It was never like to be easy. The rest is up to you, Alisaie. The treatment itself will take time and focus, so we will need a quiet room. I'm sure our hosts can spare one. I will go with her. It may be a while before we return, so I would ask for your patience...and your faith.

**ALPHINAUD:** We'll bring Ga Bu back. You see if we don't!

**000:** 'Twould seem our part is played. Let us find a place to recuperate while we wait for news. For years, Eorzea has labored to find a solution to the primal problem, without success. Any hope that tempering could be reversed faded long ago. I myself had given it up as impossible─given up on the tempered and the Light-corrupted alike. They were problems to be tolerated, or else eliminated, I believed, and to think otherwise was pure naivety. Childishness, even. But Alisaie refused to give up. She struggled, and she struggled...and her efforts were rewarded with a way to bring back Halric. And now countless others may no longer be beyond salvation. However much we bicker, I have the greatest respect for my sister. Had I half her stubbornness─nay, her *unwillingness* to accept the status quo, I would be a far better person. A far better Scion.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Well, if it's any consolation, she's in awe of your work. Don't tell me, tell her.

**YSHTOLA:** She told you of my graduation thesis? How very...embarrassing. Nonetheless, it is comforting─and not a little surprising─to hear that I'm still capable of impressing my sister. On the rare occasions I'm not annoying her, that is. I should, I know. Yet despite my good intent, I have the feeling that I would only succeed in incurring her ire. Alisaie! Are you all right?

**GABU:** The treatment─did it work?

**ALPHINAUD:** I'm so glad to see you all! Delighted, happy, glad!

**GABU:** Ga Bu!

**GRAHATIA:** All this time, my mind was filled with thoughts of Great Father Titan. But I never forgot about Mother and Father. Always, they were in my heart. Constantly, ever, always. So I tried to focus on their faces. Theirs and yours. Alisaie's and everyone's. And I found that I could remember. One thing, then another, and another!

**ALISAIE:** Your hopes reached Ga Bu. They helped him to hold on.

**GABU:** I'm so proud of you, Ga Bu.

**ALISAIE:** I couldn't have done it without you, Alisaie. Can you help the others too? Cure them, heal them, help them?

**GRAHATIA:** Yes. We can. All of them.

**ALISAIE:** Without wishing to dampen the mood, I feel compelled to add certain caveats regarding the viability of the treatment for general use. As you know, reversing the effects of tempering demands a profuse amount of aether. And while Alisaie was able to heal Ga Bu alone, I fear the same will not be true for those who exhibit more advanced symptoms. Moreover, the treatment's effects are limited to the soul. It offers no succor to those whose very flesh has been altered through prolonged exposure to a primal's influence. All of which is to say that we cannot save everyone.

**ALPHINAUD:** Maybe we can't. Or maybe we can. No one gave us a hope of saving Ga Bu, and yet here we are. We must find a way to treat as many as possible.

**YSHTOLA:** Then...the next logical step would be to produce a veritable army of porxies, would it not? Granted, it seemed a simple enough process in the First, but I suspect it will be different here in the Source. Not that I am any authority, of course...

**ALISAIE:** Yet there *is* an authority on familiars to whom we may grudgingly turn. She's stubborn, haughty, eccentric, irascible, laconic, annoying─and her name is Master Matoya. The real one.

**GABU:** I have to go now, Ga Bu, but the people here will look after you, all right? And I promise to come and visit you again soon.

**MATOYA:** All right! Thank you, Alisaie! Thank you!

**YSHTOLA:** Nary a word from you all this time, then you bring every man and his poroggo with you. Did no one teach you any manners, girl?

**MATOYA:** They were too busy teaching me aetherology, Master. Jesting aside, I wanted to be the one to express our gratitude. I am told you spared no effort to sustain our bodies while we were away. And for that we owe you our lives. Thank you.

**YSHTOLA:** Hmph. You were gone so long, I was starting to think you'd set your heart on staying.

**ALPHINAUD:** It wasn't easy to leave, as it happens. Seldom does one have the opportunity to study other worlds, and I would not have minded extending my stay by a handful of years.

**YSHTOLA:** Ever the scholar, Y'shtola dedicated herself to studying ancient civilizations of the First, befriending a tribe known as the Night's Blessed in the process. There, she took on the name of Matoya, and won the respect of all the children of the forest.

**MATOYA:** I merely adopted an alias in accordance with the custom of my hosts. Yours just happened to be the first name that came to mind.

**YSHTOLA:** You mean to tell me you went gallivanting about using my name, and only bother to visit when you need a favor? And don't pretend you don't! I taught you long enough.

**MATOYA:** Indeed. And devoted pupil that I am, I could not fail to recall my master's sage advice: “When the answer eludes you, look to the wisdom of your elders.”

**GRAHATIA:** You there─were you going to introduce yourself?

**MATOYA:** How remiss of me. G'raha Tia is my name, and I am proud to call myself a Scion. I too wish to offer my gratitude for your invaluable aid in sustaining the Archons' bodies...as well as my apologies. It was my inexpert summoning spell which endangered their lives in the first place.

**GRAHATIA:** Ah, yes, the one bent on digging up the mysteries of Allag. Old Galuf used to speak of you, and Krile's told me all about your recent exploits. Do you have a bad back, or something? At ease, boy! Whatever mess you've made, I'm not in the habit of dwelling on the failings of the younger generation.

**MATOYA:** ...You are too kind. I have also heard much and more about you, Master Matoya. 'Tis an honor to finally make your acquaintance.

**GRAHATIA:** Well, that's more than enough pleasantries for anyone. Tell me what you want. I haven't got all day. ...So that's the way of it. It should be a simple enough matter to make the familiar. The magick, on the other hand...

**MATOYA:** Ah, that you may leave to me. Being the only one possessed of royal blood, I alone can imbue the subject with the necessary magick.

**GRAHATIA:** So I just need to create porxies with the power to stir the soul. “Just,” I say, though we're talking about a veritable herd of the little buggers. We'd collapse before we reached double figures. But if I could get a *familiar* to create the familiars─a mother porxie, as it were... It seems I haven't seen the last of that moldy old hole after all... Right. To begin with, I need you to gather a few ingredients. Listen well to what the poroggos say. Or you'll wish you had. Right then! Let's get this over with! Newborns are wont to be difficult! Show her who's in charge! There we are. Quite tame.

**MATOYA:** Then all that remains is for me to imbue her with the magick. My friends, I'm afraid I must trouble you for your aether once more. That should suffice...

**YSHTOLA:** Good. Let's set her to work then, shall we? I want to see some porxies. Assuming, that is, someone can spare the requisite energy? A mere drop in the ocean for the great sorceress Matoya, I daresay. Excellent. Our very own litter of Angelos. And we can make as many more as we want simply by providing the mother porxie with additional aether.

**ALISAIE:** I will require a moment before I try again.

**ALPHINAUD:** It's still hard work, but a damn sight more efficient than making them one by one. Thank you, Master Matoya. Everyone. We're a step closer to our goal.

**YSHTOLA:** Distributed amongst the allied nations, they should do much to facilitate closer dialogue with the beast tribes. And given their present travails, I believe our friends in Limsa Lominsa should be the first beneficiaries.

**MATOYA:** Agreed. Though I must leave this errand to you. I doubt my legs will carry me out of the cave, much less to Vylbrand. Thank you for taking the lead in gathering the ingredients. I expect you would benefit from a rest too.

**YSHTOLA:** In addition to the porxies, I trust you've gained an inkling of how much effort goes into the creation of familiars. Or mayhap you attribute your struggles to old age?

**MATOYA:** If I said yes, would it persuade you to treat me like an adult?

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERA:** Hmph! Not with that pertness, it wouldn't. Anyway, assuming you have no other favors to ask, I shall be leaving.

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERB:** Look who's come crawlin'!

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERC:** Traitor!

**SICARD:** You can shove yer peace!

**MERLWYB:** Welcome aboard, Admiral. I'll wager you don't remember me. Sicard, actin' captain of the Bloody Executioners, at your service.

**SICARD:** 'Twas kind of you to invite us. Now, if Captain Hyllfyr has a message for me, I bid you speak it.

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERA:** *We* have just the one demand: that you forget this bilge about makin' peace with the beastmen. Ours is a nation of pirates. Always has been, always will be. Deny us our right to plunder and you deny who we are!

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERB:** Too bloody right!

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERC:** Pirates till we die!

**MERLWYB:** What we want, we take!

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERA:** Piracy has no place in our future.

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERC:** What she say?

**MERLWYB:** Pirates...have no place?

**SICARD:** Our nation has prospered through piracy, 'tis true. Yet it is but one part of our long and storied history. Centuries ago, our ancestors led a failed rebellion, and were driven from their homes with little more than the shirts on their backs. In fear of their lives, they sailed south, until they came to these shores. Finding the land occupied by kobolds, however, they were forced to turn to piracy in order to survive. And survive they did. But not so long ago, when the Empire threatened to crush everything we'd built, we set aside piracy and joined hands with our neighbors. This, too, was in order to survive. And survive we did. Time after time we fought the Empire, and time after time we won. And through trade with our newfound allies, we prospered more than we ever did through pillaging and plundering! The Empire teeters on the brink of collapse. Ere long, provinces like Werlyt and Bozja and many others will regain their freedom. When they do, our matchless fleet will lead the world in a new golden age of commerce. The tides favor us, and the ocean beckons with her vast bounty... But if we cling to the old ways, this great ship we call Limsa will trade the boundless seas for a lagoon! Shall we scorn the world's wealth for a plundered pittance, then? Or shall we embrace change and thrive, like our ancestors before us? The choice is yours. But if we are to prosper in the coming age, the whole of Vylbrand must become our ship, and the kobold and Sahagin our crewmates!

**MERLWYB:** Rousin' words. Might even be some truth in 'em. But piratin's all we've ever known, and we ain't about to give it up just 'cause you say so! Still, we're all Lominsans here, an' no one wants a war. So where does that leave us? Long before you became Admiral, I heard you was captain of the League o' Lost Bastards. That true? If so, you'd know how we pirates settle our differences.

**SICARD:** A duel. Very well. As Admiral of Limsa Lominsa, I accept your challenge.

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERA:** No subtitles, report if shown. This ain't over! Not till one of us is dead! Finish the job...or *I* will!

**BLOODYEXECUTIONERB:** It's the captain!

**HYLLFYR:** Captain Hyllfyr!

**SICARD:** Ye fool. 'Twas over afore it began.

**HYLLFYR:** Captain...

**SICARD:** Seems the whelps've been yappin' while their master was abed. Listen well, all o' ye. Since the signin' o' the Galadion Accord, we all of us've been part o' the same crew─the crew o' the good ship Limsa Lominsa. At the helm o' that ship is the Admiral, an' 'tis *she* who decides where we sail. Was I not clear on that point? Or did ye forget whose deck ye stand on? Nay? Then what in the seven 'ells're ye playin' at!?

**HYLLFYR:** It's all we know, Captain. If we ain't pirates, what are we?

**MERLWYB:** Yer bloody idiots, is what you are! Idiots with yer whole lives ahead o' ye! Ye can do anythin' ye want─be anythin' ye want! We're pirates, aye... An' we pirates love our loot. But that ain't our first love. Our first love is the sea, the sea an' what she brings us─freedom. So 'old fast to that. Let the brine-crusted 'usk that stands before ye now be the last o' them as knew naught save 'ow to steal, an' make o' yerselves a *new* breed o' pirate! Lad... I made ye me right hand 'cause I saw somethin' in ye. An' I still do. Ye've the makin's of a captain. All you lack's the belief. Well now! It seems we're of one mind after all! Apologies for the misunderstanding, Admiral. We're with ye, wherever ye be headed.

**HYLLFYR:** You have my thanks, Hyllfyr.

**MERLWYB:** No subtitles, report if shown. Yer choice o' duelin' pistol did not escape my notice. Good old Annihilator, ender o' many a proud pirate's voyage. Mistbeard's vanished into legend, an' it won't be long afore I take my rest in the depths. Yet be that as it may, the old ways can only truly die when we've dealt the Empire the tellin' blow. There'll be stormy seas ahead, no doubt...but I'm trustin' ye to steer us through to the other side.

**ZADA:** Greetings, Patriarch. I am Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, Admiral of Limsa Lominsa. I come before you to offer my sincerest apologies for the many wrongs committed by my people against you and yours.

**MERLWYB:** Hehehehe... You were foolish to come here. Stupid, unwise, foolish. The Great Father shall have your souls for your folly!

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye. Just as we thought.

**ALISAIE:** Now, Alisaie! Quickly!

**GRAHATIA:** You don't need to tell me!

**ALISAIE:** Let none pass! We must grant her as much time as we can!

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes, this will do! Here I go! Go, Angelo!

**ZADA:** Did it work?

**ALISAIE:** What...? What is the meaning of this!?

**ZADA:** I'm sorry...but they died by your hand. You sacrificed them to summon Titan.

**GRAHATIA:** No... No, no, no... Noooooo! Why? Why would I do such a thing?

**ALISAIE:** Would that there were a cure for the victims of the tempered...

**GABU:** Ga Bu! What are you doing here?

**ZADA:** Patriarch. Please listen to me. Hear, heed, listen. The Great Father we have been summoning is false. He only hurts us and those we love. For a long time, His voice filled my mind. It told me to do terrible things. Awful, unspeakable, terrible things. But I didn't give in to it. And you mustn't either. There's been too much pain already. So please, end the suffering.

**MERLWYB:** What...what have I done?

**ZADA:** We share this child's desire, Patriarch. An end to summoning. For it spells naught but misery for both our peoples. For many long years, man and kobold have feuded over territory, pillaging and perishing for the earth beneath our feet. It may be said that we fought to survive, but what we have sown in blood, we have reaped in suffering, and it cannot go on. I would see us set aside the past and work together for peace.

**MERLWYB:** It was wrong of me to hurt my own in the name of the Great Father. Sinful, evil, wrong. But that doesn't mean there can be peace between us. Men cannot be trusted! The bounty of the land was to be ours, and yours the bounty of the sea! But you broke the pact! Violated, breached, broke! Unready as we were, what choice had we but to call upon the divine to rid ourselves of your tyranny?

**ZADA:** None. And I do not blame you for it. In violation of the spirit─if not the letter─of the pact, we took your lands for our own. The fault lies wholly with us. On behalf of all Lominsans, I offer you my humblest apology. I pray you will find it in your heart to accept it. Yet I know an apology alone will not serve to make things right. So we will revise the pact to leave no room for doubt, and any who violate it shall face justice swift and certain.

**MERLWYB:** No! We won't be fooled! Not again!

**ZADA:** Please, hear me to the end. Fleeting though it was, there was a time when man and kobold abided together in harmony. In cooperation. In those days, your people shared the secrets of smelting─knowledge which allowed Limsa Lominsa to thrive. Much of what we have, we owe to the kobolds. And so, for the good of all who dwell on this isle, I wish to make you an offer. We will bear your people's wares to every corner of the world, and trade them in your stead. In return, we will bring you the bounty not only of the sea, but lands both near and far. Whatever you desire, the Navigator as my witness, you shall have it. There will be no more man and beastman─just the crew of the great ship that is Vylbrand. And together, we will share in the wealth of the world─if you will only accept our hand in friendship.

**GABU:** We want to believe you! We truly do! But we believed you before, and you betrayed us! Fooled, deceived, betrayed us!

**MERLWYB:** There are bad men, it's true, but there are also good ones. And the ones before you are the best of them. They were always kind to me─caring, nice, kind─and I trust them with my life.

**ZADA:** Before I became Admiral, I was a pirate. I stole. I fought. I stained the sea red with blood. Such is my past, and I dare not forget it, however much I might want to. That is Death Penalty. The pistol I used to pass judgment on my own sire when he fell thrall to Leviathan and betrayed his comrades. It is loaded. If you were to point it at my head and pull the trigger, I would most assuredly die. Though it isn't much, my life is the single most valuable thing I possess. If it will suffice to atone for past wrongs─take it. A single bullet to annul the old pact, and my blood to write it anew. What comes after, I entrust to this man, my second-in-command. I know that he will do his utmost for the happiness of all who call Vylbrand home.

**ALISAIE:** I do not trust you. Not yet. But Ga Bu does. And I will trust him.

**ZADA:** We want you to know that we respect your faith. There's nothing wrong with giving thanks to the land which sustains you. But summoning is different. Should you hear of anyone who would attempt it, we ask that you appeal to their better judgment, or failing that, seek our aid. We're always ready to help.

**MERLWYB:** Many and more of my brethren are yet in thrall to the Great Father, just as I was. If you could free them too, I would be grateful. Appreciative, thankful, grateful.

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Tis we who should be grateful, Patriarch. I thank you for affording us this chance.

**STORMOFFICER:** Right, let's return to the Rising Stones.

**MERLWYB:** Admiral! Something strange is afoot at the Floating City! 

**STORMOFFICER:** Breathe, man. What is it?

**ALPHINAUD:** I think it's best you see for yourself. Please come with me.

**ALISAIE:** What in the world is that?

**STORMOFFICER:** A tower.

**MERLWYB:** You can see it too, then? I feared I was losing my wits. One moment I was patrolling as usual, and the next, it was just...there.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes? This is she... I am... Aye. I'm looking at it. What!? Understood... Send the Elder Seedseer my regards. The communications officer. It seems this isn't the only tower. They've sprung up all across Eorzea. Nothing more is known─only that they appear to be of Garlean construction. Our allies on the Ala Mhigan front are on highest alert. Forgive my directness─but would you join them? They may well need the help.

**MERLWYB:** Of course, Admiral. We shall make all haste.

**LYSE:** My thanks. I will return to Limsa to weigh our response. Look for Commander Hext when you arrive in Ala Mhigo. And may the Navigator speed you on your way!

**FEARFULCITIZEN:** Thank you for coming so soon. I'll send for Commander Aldynn at once, and we can decide what to do about these infernal towers.

**ALPHINAUD:** Rhalgr preserve!

**LYSE:** It can't be...

**RAUBAHN:** The palace! After them!

**FANDANIEL:** You're here. Good.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, well, well, to be received by such an illustrious cast! Why, even the hero of the piece is here! I feel quite starstruck!

**ALISAIE:** Is that...Asahi!?

**FANDANIEL:** His body, more like. You don't fool us!

**000:** You saw straight through it... Anyone would think you'd dealt with Ascians before! Permit me to introduce myself. I am Fandaniel, and may I say what a pleasure it is to finally make your acquaintance.

**FANDANIEL:** What will you say? What do you want? The towers─what are they for?

**ALPHINAUD:** My, straight to business, is it? Suit yourself... It is my intention to recreate the Final Days, to which end I have distributed a collection of rather ingenious devices─or “towers”─which will, in time, give rise to the grandest of spectacles!

**FANDANIEL:** The Final Days...? But it was the Ascians who labored to prevent them!

**ALISAIE:** You're quite right! Though I would expect no less from one responsible for eliminating my unsundered colleagues. Honestly, the three of them were *obsessed* with restoring the one true world. As a sovereign individual, however, I never had much interest in such things. I mean, why bother when you're just another sundered minion? Admittedly, Elidibus was not convinced by that argument. But thanks to you, I'm finally free of his incessant nagging! Free to use my powers as I see fit! To fulfill my heart's desire! And my heart's desire is to lay this half-broken world to waste, leaving nary a fleck of dust behind!

**FANDANIEL:** What!? Why would you want such a thing!?

**RAUBAHN:** Because I want wretched creatures who ask such meaningless questions to die! You! And you! And you! I want you *all* to die! And I want to die too! Oh yes, I want to die and take everyone with me in a paroxysm of pain and suffering! I'm different, you see. From the ancients who clung to dear life. And from you. So don't bother trying to reason with me. You will find I have no reason. Or creed. Or any such tripe. I just want to destroy the world. But please *do* resist with all your might. It will add to my enjoyment. Now then, ladies and gentlemen! Keep your eyes peeled, for the curtains have risen on the spectacle to end all spectacles! We, the Telophoroi, shall be your performers, and this very star our stage! Ah, but I nearly forgot! I have a message for you. Ahem! My esteemed patron, Lord Zenos, eagerly awaits you at the heart of the chaos. While I wish only to destroy the world, he exists solely to relive a certain...transcendent moment with you, and it is for *that* reason he would reduce all to ash. Pray see to it his dreams do not go unfulfilled. For if you should disappoint him... My trusty companion here─whom I've dubbed “Lunar Bahamut”─will burn your cities and everyone in them.

**SYSTEM:** Everyone out. My men will tend to the blaze.

**LYSE:** Meanwhile, somewhere in the Lochs...

**RESISTANCEWARRIOR:** The scouts should've been back by now. I'm going to go and find them. Oh, thank goodness for that!

**SYSTEM:** Glory be... Glory be... Glory be... Glory be...to Garlemald!

**FANDANIEL:** Meanwhile, in the imperial palace...

**ZENOS:** The piles have been driven as planned, and the first of the beasts has roared to life. Moreover, I am pleased to report that preparations are well underway for the rest. Ere long, chaos shall reign over all the land─as befits the Final Days.

**FANDANIEL:** Call it what you will. So long as my friend returns to me, fangs bared and claws sharpened, I care not.

**ZENOS:** Of course, my lord. By strange coincidence, your dear friend chanced to be present when I made my declaration. I took the liberty of informing her that you await her coming. Though, I confess, I may have singed her a little in the process.

**FANDANIEL:** And why do you tell me this? Are you in such a hurry to die?

**ZENOS:** Ah, my apologies. I must guard my tongue lest it be the end of me. Though...there is something to be said for such a glorious death. Better to fall to one who *has it all* than falter before an inferior... I shall keep it in mind as a contingency. For now, however, I shall proceed with the plan. My lord.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**RYNE:** I'm drawing out the Darkness. Get ready!

**EDEN3BOSS3:** It worked, Gaia! We've done it! So this all took place a hundred years ago... But what does it have to do with Gaia? I know this place...! It's the gaol in Eulmore! Whatever stands in our way... ...we will never give up hope!

**EDEN3BOSS4:** She deserves...all the happiness...in the world...

**RYNE:** Eden will become a utopia... One that we may share for all eternity.

**EDEN3BOSS4:** She's still in there, somewhere... I won't give up on our future, Gaia! No matter what!

**EDEN3BOSS5:** Our utopia... Our dream!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**URIANGER:** Ere we begin, I would like to offer my gratitude to Masters Thancred and Urianger. 'Tis no small feat to infiltrate the imperial capital and live to tell the tale, much less in times of civil war. Thanks to them, we may plot our course in full knowledge of how the winds blow in Garlemald.

**RAUBAHN:** Full glad are we to have been of service. But verily, such dangers as we did encounter pale into insignificance next to those faced by our comrades. An Ascian armed with the might of Bahamut, bent on bringing about the Final Days...

**KANESENNA:** Theatrics. He sought only to make a show of the power at the Telophoroi's disposal. But since then, we have seen no sign of this “Fandaniel,” or his wyrm. And while we've done what we can to bolster our defenses, there's no telling where he might strike next.

**LYSE:** Whenever and wherever it may be, we must use the intervening time to learn more of our enemy. 'Twas with this in mind that we dispatched scouts to investigate the towers...

**ALISAIE:** Our advance party took longer than expected to return...and when they did, they tried to kill us. Luckily, I'd seen that sort of thing before, and we were able to restrain them before they did any harm. Then it was just a matter of letting the porxies do their work.

**LYSE:** Are you saying they were tempered?

**URIANGER:** Once they'd come back to their senses, they told us everything they could. It seems that just as they were getting close to the tower, they heard an earsplitting roar. And that was the last thing they remembered. But what worries me most is what they were saying right before they attacked. “Glory be to Garlemald.”

**AYMERIC:** The tempered have heretofore ever been thralls to primal entities. Yet these hapless souls were compelled to accept a *nation* as the object of their devotion. This calleth into question all that we know of the condition.

**GRAHATIA:** Would that the unsettling news ended there. Alas, there is more. Following the earlier reports of missing Amalj'aa, we have learned that other beast tribes have suffered similar losses. And we now have reason to believe that the abductions are connected to the appearance of the towers. Our scouts sighted black-garbed figures leading shackled Ixal in the direction of the tower in Dravania. The Temple Knights were able to intercept them before they could reach their destination, liberating the Ixal and apprehending their captors─each of whom was found to be equipped with Garlean arms and armor.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** So the Empire is the common thread.

**RAUBAHN:** With the support of Zenos, it seems likely that Fandaniel has rallied a faction of the splintered Garlean army to the banner of the Telophoroi.

**ALPHINAUD:** Lord Hien reached the same conclusion when I shared our findings with Doma. The plan had been to march on Garlemald from the east and west in order to force a peace treaty, but the situation has changed. Dealing with the threat of the towers must come first. Given the nature of the enemy, and the proven risk of tempering, I could think of few suitable candidates to aid in this task. But I am confident in my choice.

**RAUBAHN:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ARENVALD:** Resistant to primal influence as they are, they can investigate the towers without fear of being turned.

**RAUBAHN:** We're glad to put our gifts to use, Commander.

**ARENVALD:** Gifted or not, going behind enemy lines remains a perilous undertaking. But we must know more if we're to strike back at our foe. I'm counting on you.

**RAUBAHN:** If it would give us the upper hand, I'd do it a hundred times over. We won't let you down.

**ALPHINAUD:** That concludes the briefing. You two─make ready and join your escort.

**ARENVALD:** Are you certain about this, Arenvald?

**ALPHINAUD:** I am. Come on, let's talk outside. So you know, I've already gone through all the formalities at the Rising Stones. Made sure to inform J'moldva and V'mah at Rhalgr's Reach as well.

**ARENVALD:** Arenvald, I admire your enthusiasm...but this is far more dangerous than anything you have done before.

**ALPHINAUD:** I know the risks. And I also know what's in store if we don't stop Fandaniel from carrying out his plan. With this power of mine, I can make a difference. If I stood idly by, I would regret it for the rest of my life.

**FORDOLA:** And you, Fordola? Is this what you want?

**ARENVALD:** What're you asking me for? It's not like I have any say in the matter.

**FORDOLA:** Don't pretend. We both know Commander Aldynn gave you a chance to refuse. And you didn't.

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. So the Empire's finished, is it? That's what they're all saying. That the great and glorious Garlemald slit its own throat. And now, from out of its twitching carcass crawls the Telophoroi, with bloody *Zenos* at its head. I fought for Garlemald. Killed for Garlemald. What was I a part of? I need to know. Whatever it is...I need to know.

**THANCRED:** Very well. If your hearts are set on this, I shall not stand in your way.

**ARENVALD:** If you've finished with your touching display of camaraderie, I have a question: which tower are you planning to investigate, exactly?

**THANCRED:** Well, the one in Gyr Abania's said to be tightly guarded. It's patrol after patrol out there, apparently. We'd be spotted before we got anywhere near it. Which is why we've set our sights on the one in Paglth'an, instead. There shouldn't be anything like as many imperials to worry about down there.

**ARENVALD:** Even so, I doubt the local Amalj'aa will look kindly on it if they catch you sneaking around in their territory.

**ALPHINAUD:** Fordola and I had a chance to learn the lie of the land in our previous forays there. We might still find trouble, but at least we won't lose our way. Well, we'd best not keep them waiting any longer.

**ARENVALD:** Mayhap when all of this is over, we could take another trip to Loch Seld. I would have you know I've become a rather capable swimmer since our last visit.

**FORDOLA:** Ha! I'll believe that when I see it! Though, to be fair, getting into deep water does seem to be a Scion's lot in life... Take care, eh? It means a lot, you know─you coming with me.

**ARENVALD:** I still owe you for saving my skin, don't I? Can't return the favor if I'm not there.

**ALPHINAUD:** I daresay you'll get your chance before long. That Fandaniel sounds like a tricky customer. Too much for the likes of me, anyway. But we both know I'd be just another soldier if it weren't for my gift. And I need to be a damn sight more than that, given what's coming. I realize I can't hold a candle to a hero like the Warrior of Light─or Alphinaud, for that matter. He might look like he's twelve, but he's seen more action than most people see in a lifetime. No, the fact is, I'm nothing like them, and maybe I never will be, but I'll be damned if I don't try. They're counting on me. On us. So let's give it our all.

**TATARU:** He does not want for conviction, that much is certain. So let us have faith in him. Him and Fordola both. While they see to the towers, I would attend to another task: chasing down this “Lunar” Bahamut.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Tataru-)(Ugh! Bloody thing...) Can you hear me? It's Tataru. I'm happy to say we managed to find Estinien! (-Tataru-)And...I'm sorry to say he went running off again the moment we told him about Bahamut. (-Tataru-)But he did mutter something about heading to Ishgard, so if you're quick, you might still be able to catch him!

**TATARU:** Even if we set out this instant, he may already have left by the time we arrive. Have her send the *Bonanza* to Ishgard. It may prove useful should we need to give chase.

**THANCRED:** (-Tataru-)Gladly! I'll see to it as soon as Krile and I get back to the Rising Stones. Good luck!

**URIANGER:** While you go off on your dragoon hunt, Urianger and I will return to headquarters. We have much to tell the others.

**ALISAIE:** I wish you every success in your search for our elusive friend. May we all meet again ere long.

**GRAHATIA:** No sign of him. Not that I've ever met him before. But the way Alphinaud goes on about him, I'm fairly sure I could pick him out in a crowd.

**ESTINIEN:** Speaking of which, it does seem awfully quiet. If the erstwhile Azure Dragoon had returned to Ishgard, would it not be a source of general excitement?

**ALISAIE:** First the Scions' coinkeeper, and now you. I'm beginning to think these meetings are more than mere coincidence. Not that I'm complaining. It's been too long.

**ESTINIEN:** “Too long”?

**ALISAIE:** You look an ilm taller and twice as rugged. It suits you, Alphinaud. Quieter, though. Have you been giving him lessons on how to be the strong, silent type?

**GRAHATIA:** I... ...am not... ALPHINAUD! If the two of you are such firm friends, perhaps you should remember what he looks like! And what do you mean, “rugged”!? Ungh! Had my brother mentioned what an oaf you are, I'd never have bothered looking for you in the first place!

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien Wyrmblood, the Azure Dragoon... He who fought and felled the dread wyrm Nidhogg at the Warrior of Light's side! To think the day would come when I should see this living legend with my own eyes!

**ALPHINAUD:** Would someone mind explaining what is going on?

**ESTINIEN:** Is everything all right!? I thought I heard Alisaie shouting... Estinien! It's been too long! No, no, it's quite understandable. That was hardly the first time we've been confused for one another. Nor, I suspect, will it be the last.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well I for one will not be making that mistake again. What I will say...for the second time today...is that you've grown. Inside and out. I can tell.

**ALISAIE:** One can't remain a spoiled little lordling forever, you know.

**000:** At least someone's having a good time... You know, when we were growing up, Alphinaud would never befriend other boys because he couldn't stand the thought of not being in charge. But maybe that's changed. He seems just as happy around Estinien as he does Arenvald.

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? Perhaps he sees them as the brothers he never had. I think he learned how to talk *with* people rather than *at* them. Well...you can't keep him all to yourself forever.

**ESTINIEN:** Hmph. Good luck to them. It hasn't been easy being his sister, I can tell you that. I wouldn't be so sure. He still loves nothing better than the sound of his own voice. Keep him to my─!? You're joking, aren't you? I'd be *glad* if someone would take him off my hands!

**ALPHINAUD:** No rest for the righteous, eh? Speaking of which, I was just on my way to borrow an airship to take me to Azys Lla.

**ESTINIEN:** Azys Lla...? How could I forget? The dragon with whom Bahamut shared the deepest of bonds...

**GRAHATIA:** Aye, Tiamat, his mate. Even now, she remains imprisoned on Azys Lla, though her remorse binds her faster than any shackle.

**ALPHINAUD:** I see... As the one who first summoned Bahamut, you believe she may be able to shine some light on his latest incarnation.

**ESTINIEN:** Might I suggest that we make the journey to Azys Lla together? I'm not sure if Tataru mentioned this, but we Scions have an airship of our own now.

**ALISAIE:** I see no reason why not...assuming your sister can bear the thought of sharing a deck with me.

**GRAHATIA:** Be my guest. But confuse me with Alphinaud again, and I'll throw you overboard. Ugh! I don't know who he thinks he is, but he's nothing like Alphinaud painted him to be!

**TIAMAT:** I will admit, he is not exactly as I imagined him either. Based on what I had read of the man, I think I was expecting someone a little less...blunt?

**ESTINIEN:** (-Tiamat-)My sire's mortal companion... What bringeth thee back to this forsaken place, child of man?

**TIAMAT:** Hmph. It's plain she knows naught of recent events. Perhaps you should enlighten her.

**ALISAIE:** (-Tiamat-)Ahhh... That my sins should be repeated... (-Tiamat-)I sensed not the faintest stirring. (-Tiamat-)As to who could have called him forth...I know of none save the dragons of Meracydia. Our children... (-Tiamat-)The eikon claimed their souls when first he manifested. And robbed of their will, they became tools for the Allagans' dark designs.

**TIAMAT:** Much like those held here in Azys Lla. If dragons who worship Bahamut are required to summon him, that must mean... I've seen it with my own eyes. Captives of a lost empire, neither alive nor dead, existing only to preserve Bahamut's corporeal form.

**ESTINIEN:** (-Tiamat-)Yes. The dragons of Meracydia are at the mercy of this Ascian. There can be no other explanation. (-Tiamat-)Accursed Ascians! Vile minions of Darkness! (-Tiamat-)Again you would profane the memory of my beloved, and strip our children of their freedom, their dignity! Are there no depths to which you will not stoop!?

**TIAMAT:** Your children's pain means nothing to them. They laugh at your kind's suffering. But tears will not right this wrong. Nor will lamentations see the perpetrators punished.

**ESTINIEN:** (-Tiamat-)What wouldst thou have from me, slayer of dragons?

**TIAMAT:** Behavior befitting a great wyrm. We came here to ask mighty Tiamat of the first brood, consort of Bahamut, mother of the dragons of Meracydia, what she intends to do about the crimes committed against her children!

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Tiamat-)Were I free, I would answer thine insolence with fire. But words shall have to suffice. (-Tiamat-)Recall, mortals, that it was I who did first summon my beloved, praying with all my being to bring him forth. You who contend with eikons cannot well be ignorant of the consequence.

**TIAMAT:** ...You too were exposed to his influence. That you are yet in possession of your own will is testament to the indomitable strength of your soul. But were you to meet with Bahamut again, you fear you might succumb.

**ALISAIE:** (-Tiamat-)Indeed. Ask the dragonslayer, and he will tell thee the power we of the first brood wield. Were I to lose myself to the eikon's influence, all would pay the price. (-Tiamat-)But it is of little matter. For even had I the strength to resist, I yet lack the strength to break my shackles. This prison shall be my tomb.

**TIAMAT:** On the matter of Bahamut's influence, at least, I believe we can be of some assistance. If you're afraid of being enthralled, don't be─we have a cure. And while we've never tried it on one such as you, its basic principles are universal.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Tiamat-)Speakest thou in earnest?

**TIAMAT:** There is no future for those bound to the past. That you committed a terrible sin, I do not dispute. But if you feel remorse, you may yet make amends. We offer you that chance. Take it, or you will forever remain a prisoner, not of these cruel shackles, but of your own guilt.

**ALISAIE:** (-Tiamat-)A chance to make amends... To lay Bahamut's memory to rest... (-Tiamat-)When our own star faced annihilation, Hydaelyn granted us sanctuary. And now your foes would bring about Her destruction. This I cannot allow. For the debt I owe to Hydaelyn, and to all who have suffered for my sins...I shall fight with you, children of man.

**TIAMAT:** Ungh...! No... I'm almost there...! This is it, Angelo!

**ALISAIE:** (-Tiamat-)Yes...I feel it! The eikon's grip groweth weak!

**GRAHATIA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Did it work?

**TIAMAT:** We won't know for certain until the shackles are removed.

**GRAHATIA:** (-Tiamat-)Answer me this, children of man... Can my kindred be saved in like manner?

**TIAMAT:** Many have been subjected to the Allagans' dark arts, their flesh irrevocably altered. For such tortured souls, I fear there can be no salvation.

**ALISAIE:** (-Tiamat-)My children... (-Tiamat-)Should you hearken unto my call, we shall fly together once more. But should you not...I shall grant you peace. (-Tiamat-)Better to die than live as a tool of evil. You too would wish this, I know...and I shall do as I must.

**TIAMAT:** When that time comes, you won't be alone. We'll stand by you.

**ESTINIEN:** (-Tiamat-)Thou hast my gratitude, little one.

**TIAMAT:** Alphinaud's ready. It's time. Do it, and let's hope the treatment worked as it should.

**ALISAIE:** (-Tiamat-)Bahamut...my beloved. (-Tiamat-)For vengeance...and atonement...I rise.

**GRAHATIA:** By the gods...

**ESTINIEN:** Urianger, your timing could not be better. Understood, we're on our way. It's Bahamut. He's been sighted over Paglth'an. He flies for the largest Amalj'aa settlement in the region─at the head of a vast host, including dragons.

**TIAMAT:** Did you hear all that, Alphinaud? You'd best rejoin your comrades. I'll make my own way. Our enemy awaits. Shall we?

**AMALJAACHIEFTAIN:** Ascian vermin! You shall torment my children no longer! Children of man... The shade of my beloved is no more, and I...I shall be forever in your debt. By your deeds are we set free. And free we shall remain, as long as I draw breath. Never again shall the dragons of Meracydia hearken to the lies of the Ascians. This I vow.

**000:** (-???-)Noble warriors! The dragons chose their friends well... Long have our peoples waged war, but no more. Your fallen lie beside our own. By our words and deeds shall we honor their sacrifice.

**AMALJAACHIEFTAIN:** What will you say? You would make peace with Ul'dah then? We would be proud to call you our allies. Then let us put the past behind us.

**GRAHATIA:** The enemy of our enemy is our friend, and you have proven yourselves worthy of our trust. It is the Garleans who are deserving of our fury. I shall see that my brethren learn the truth of this day, and rally as many as possible to the cause. Till we meet again.

**THANCRED:** And thus did we make allies of the Amalj'aa...

**SYSTEM:** It would certainly seem that way. The sultana *will* be pleased. Let's go and give her the good news, shall we?

**ARENVALD:** Some time earlier, inside the Paglth'an tower...

**FORDOLA:** What in Rhalgr's name happened here?

**ARENVALD:** The gods only know... But you can bet these poor sods aren't here by choice.

**FORDOLA:** Quickly, we've got to get them free!

**ARENVALD:** Get back!

**FORDOLA:** No... What have I done?

**ARENVALD:** It's too late for them! We're leaving. Now! No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Don't you dare! We came together, and we're leaving together!

**DAMIELLIOT:** Fordola... Have you been waiting here all this time?

**ALPHINAUD:** We have done what we can. The rest is up to him.

**DAMIELLIOT:** May we see him?

**ALPHINAUD:** I...do not think that wise. You must let him sleep.

**FORDOLA:** Thank you for bringing him back. He owes you his life. I just... I just *wish* I'd been there. Perhaps─ I don't know. Perhaps I could have...

**ALPHINAUD:** Could've what? Got tempered!? Don't flatter yourself. You can't save everyone. No one can. Not even the Warrior of bloody Light. People die all the time. For no good reason. And those who take up the sword die quicker than most. If you're going to shed a tear every time a soldier falls on the battlefield, you'd best stay away. It's no place for the weak of heart.

**FORDOLA:** It may be... That victory cannot be won without cost. But all life is precious, and I refuse to shrug at its loss!

**ESTINIEN:** “All life is precious”? Hmph. You need to grow up, little man─before your sparkling ideals get everyone killed.

**FORDOLA:** You're right. He *is* idealistic. But the world has more than its fair share of realists like you and me. It's people like him who dare to dream that things could be better─and make it happen, against all the odds. They are the ones whose names live on forever. The heroes.

**ESTINIEN:** The battlefield's littered with would-be heroes. At this rate, you lot'll be next. And what'll become of your precious dreams then!? They'll be gone─like dust on the wind!

**ALPHINAUD:** Dreams worth fighting for don't die so easily.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Your Grace. Pray forgive us our lateness.

**THANCRED:** Think not of that. I understand a close comrade of yours was wounded in the line of duty. Arenvald. It was at the Alliance's behest that he risked all, and we are grieved to hear of his condition. Rest assured, he will receive the finest care our chirurgeons can provide, on that you have my word. Now...we would share with you the findings of the mission. Pipin─pray relate to our guests the details of Fordola's account.

**URIANGER:** First Bahamut, now Ifrit. Or “Lunar Ifrit,” as Fandaniel would doubtless have it.

**YSHTOLA:** 'Tis now all but certain that the towers were conceived to facilitate the summoning of primals by those imprisoned within. Less certain is the means by which the Telophoroi constrain the wills of said entities to enact *their* designs in defiance of the pleas of their victims.

**THANCRED:** Mayhap they do not. If mere proximity to the towers is enough to make loyal servants of the Empire's mortal enemies, it stands to reason that the same is true for those held captive. They invoke their gods for the good of Garlemald, and in their disturbed state of mind summon a primal whose form reflects their own alteration.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** It all begins to make sense. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the towers bear a striking resemblance to a much larger structure which Urianger and I observed from afar during our visit to the imperial capital. Assuming it too is capable of tempering those in its immediate vicinity, it would go some way to explain the swiftness with which the Telophoroi managed to rally so many imperials to their cause.

**000:** While the situation in Garlemald is indeed troubling, I fear we have more immediate concerns. Ifrit was not the only primal summoned. At approximately the same time, observers at several other towers bore witness to the emergence of further such entities. For a blessing, none appear to wield aught approaching the destructive power of Bahamut, and the Grand Companies are moving to deal with the threat even as we speak.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** What will you say? You need only tell me where they are, Your Grace... The Grand Companies, Your Grace? Is that wise?

**YSHTOLA:** Though we are aware that the task will not be easy, we would call upon the Scions only as a last resort. Pray conserve your strength for now. After all, it was not so very long ago that you rid us of Bahamut. On which note, I am pleased to report that our talks with the Amalj'aa have reached an agreeable conclusion. They have pledged their full support to our cause. It is our hope that this historic agreement will encourage other tribes to join us at the negotiating table. And I know that I speak for all of the Allied leaders when I say that we will welcome them with open arms at such time as they do. Of course, this was only made possible by the feats of heroism performed at Paglth'an. Moreover, we shall not allow the sacrifices of those fallen in battle to have been made in vain. As hope leads to victory, shall victory lead to a new dawn for Eorzea.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** May these words ever be our guide, Your Grace.

**KRILE:** Now, if you will forgive me, I must consult with the Syndicate on the matter of our new allies' integration. Till next we meet, my friends, I bid you safe travels and blessed respite.

**URIANGER:** Welcome back. I expect you must all be exhausted. Ere you take your rest, however, I would beg a moment of your time. Thanks to Arenvald's selfless efforts, we may now be confident that we understand the function of the towers. But many questions remain regarding the reason for the summonings and what lurks behind the looming edifice in Garlemald. Until such questions are answered, we will struggle to devise an effective strategy for thwarting the Telophoroi's stated aim: nothing less than the destruction of this star. And so, given the gravity of the situation...I move that we petition the aid of Sharlayan.

**KRILE:** 'Tis possible the ancient knowledge preserved within their archives may hide a clue to our enemy's methods. But given Sharlayan's established policy of nonintervention, our former colleagues are not like to aid us in its discovery.

**GRAHATIA:** Oh, I well remember what they're like. The Forum's barefaced refusal to assist you in the days prior to the Calamity must rank as Sharlayan's most shameful act since the exodus. But were the Final Days to be reenacted, it would spell doom for us all. Surely even they cannot turn a blind eye to that. I trust we are all of the same mind on this matter... Urgent as it seemed, I took the liberty of petitioning the Alliance for leave to act as Eorzea's emissary. And have since received their blessing.

**KRILE:** I presume your role as a Student of Baldesion will carry some weight with the Forum?

**YSHTOLA:** One can but hope. If truth be told, our organization has been a shadow of its former self ever since the disappearance of the Isle of Val─but the name does still retain some degree of prestige. I only pray it will be enough. If there are no objections, I shall depart for Sharlayan at once. But before I do, I should also mention the other matter to which I would devote some time during my stay. After hearing what transpired in the First, I began to question the true nature of Hydaelyn's blessing. A topic I have discussed at some length with Y'shtola...

**000:** We were wondering: when was the last time Hydaelyn spoke to you directly?

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? Near the end of the Dragonsong War. That day in the Crystarium. ...

**KRILE:** When you regained Her blessing, was it not? But never since─not in all your time in the First, when you faced the unsundered, the very heart of Zodiark. When Elidibus sought to make Warriors of Light? That was the voice which calls constantly to all who might hear it. I spoke of *direct* communication, when Hydaelyn communed solely with you. A far rarer occurrence. Is the question truly so vexing? Perhaps you fear I will chastise you for giving the wrong answer? Or was it so long ago that you simply can't remember...

**URIANGER:** History shows us that Hydaelyn is able to awaken the Echo in Her chosen, convey Her will directly, and grant the blessing of Light. To our knowledge, however, She has not sought to intervene in man's affairs for some considerable time.

**YSHTOLA:** Might not the explanation for that lie with Her choice of champion? Mayhap She is content to trust in her judgment.

**THANCRED:** Mayhap She is. But following my initial discussion with Krile, I made inquiries of my own, and as far as I am able to tell, Hydaelyn has not made Her will known to anyone.

**YSHTOLA:** During my time in the First, the Oracle of Light spoke to me through Ryne. But that was not the will of Hydaelyn. It was Minfilia herself.

**KRILE:** Indeed. And while she and Hydaelyn were inextricably linked, Minfilia yet acted of her own volition. A messenger, yes, but one who spoke with her own voice.

**ESTINIEN:** I wonder, could Hydaelyn's silence suggest the presence of some disruptive force, perhaps? Some obstacle to communication? While I share Urianger's high opinion of your conduct, I see no reason why She would deny you Her guidance altogether. Then again, who am I to say? The fact is, we simply don't know. But if the explanation is to be found anywhere, I can think of worse places to look than the archives of Sharlayan─and their research on the aetherial sea in particular. Resolved though I am to go, believe me when I say that I take no pleasure in the thought of leaving you a member short. Now of all times. Estinien─we stand on the eve of a struggle that will decide the fate of this star. One in which we Scions may play a telling part. Yet we are but few in number. And so I must ask you again: will you join us?

**ALPHINAUD:** You see the world the way you want it to be. I see the world the way it is. You are idealistic to a fault. But I know you would never turn your back on those in need. Never close your eyes to their suffering. And somehow, your deeds lend truth to your words, giving the lie to my doubts in so doing. I have seen others draw strength from your belief. In Ishgard, in Ala Mhigo. You inspired them to stand up and fight. To win, no less. And even when you lost those you held dear, you carried their spirit with you, and made their memory your guiding light. The burden of so many hopes and dreams would be too heavy for most to bear. But you bear it willingly. As you have shown me, some dreams are too important to let go. If you have need of my strength, it's yours. After all you've done, how could I refuse?

**KRILE:** Thank you, Estinien... Whatever challenges await us, I shall not falter. You have my word.

**ALPHINAUD:** And now I may bid you farewell, safe in the knowledge that all is as it should be─in this little corner of the world at least.

**KRILE:** You will be sorely missed. Tread warily in Sharlayan...and do try not to let the Forum embroil you in their politics. A forlorn hope, I know, given the individuals involved...

**SYSTEM:** I shall do my very best. Farewell.

**FANDANIEL:** Meanwhile, in the imperial palace...

**ZENOS:** Well? Does this one meet with your approval? Apparently not. Or...could it be that you're still upset about the dragons?

**FANDANIEL:** You are unwise to remind me of so costly a failure. It will not affect our plans, I trust.

**ZENOS:** Oh, hardly at all. Though, admittedly, the chances of us being able to procure any more Meracydian dragons are rather slimmer following Tiamat's reappearance. But the seeds have been sown, my lord! We have only to wait for them to quicken.  Speaking of preparations, is it safe to assume that you will be ready to control you-know-what?

**FANDANIEL:** The hour draws nigh. This nation, forged for Ascian ends, will finally prove its worth.

**ZENOS:** A mighty Empire, now no more than an instrument of this star's destruction! What a pleasure it will be to put it to use! Which brings me back to our earlier topic. My lord─while I appreciate that it is not an easy decision, it really is past time you chose your weapon.

**FANDANIEL:** There is one that I have been meaning to test...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**IXALICHIEFTAIN:** Esteemed guests. You honor us with your presence. As there is much to discuss, let us begin.

**YSHTOLA:** Information on our taken brethren you have, yes? Hear it we would! Beyond forgiveness these featherless ones are! With rivers of blood shall they pay! Freed our people must be!

**MERLWYB:** We too would see your kin liberated, but ere we attempt their rescue, we must first find a means to negate the risk of tempering. Without that, we will be unable even to approach the towers, let alone contend with their defenders.

**SAHAGINPRIEST:** If all else fails, I've always found cannonballs quite effective...

**ZADA:** And what of the prisoners!? Would you see them ssslaughtered!?

**MERLWYB:** Think for a moment! Ponder, consider, think! If Merlwyb truly intended to bombard the towers, she would have done so by now. Remember, we came here to find a solution together, did we not?

**RAUBAHN:** Y'shtola spoke of defenders. I but offered a means to clear a path, should you require it. 

**SAHAGINPRIEST:** Given the enemy's capabilities, we will all need to play our part if we are to have any chance of success. For if any here should give less than their best, it will be to the cost of every living being on this star.

**AYMERIC:** A Paragon, the Empire, our very gods... How can we hope to prevail against sssuch odds?

**SAHAGINPRIEST:** That our foe is formidable none would deny, but our strengths are many and varied. In this chamber, I see masters of strategy, masters of magic, masters of the land, the air, and the sea. And together, there is nothing in creation we cannot overcome.

**AYMERIC:** Krrrggghhhccchhh!

**SAHAGINPRIEST:** I beg your pardon?

**ZADA:** What is it, shorewalker? Do you not express your passion thusss? A little tricky without gills, perhaps! Pshahaha! Sssuffice it to say, I am proud to be counted amongst Eorzea's finessst. We Sssahagin will play our part!

**IXALICHIEFTAIN:** We kobolds have not forgotten the crimes the overdwellers committed against us in the past. But today we look to the future, as allies united in purpose.

**KANESENNA:** Make mock of the Ixal, the Paragon does! Turns kin into puppets, pits brother against brother! Free them from his grasp, we shall!

**IXALICHIEFTAIN:** As Patriarch Za Da will attest, the Scions have granted us a means to free your brethren from their thralldom. This boon we will gladly share, that your people might never be enslaved again.

**AMALJAACHIEFTAIN:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**SAHAGINPRIEST:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**THANCRED:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALISAIE:** It's taken a while, but I do believe we might be one step closer to a world without primals. Would that Minfilia were here to see it.

**ALPHINAUD:** We still have a long way to go, and we're going to need a *lot* more porxies...but we're moving in the right direction.

**ZADA:** If I may have your attention, there is one other point I would like to raise. As we can all agree, freeing those held captive must take precedence over every other concern. But experience has taught us that none save those with the capacity to resist tempering can hope to enter the towers unscathed. And even once inside, a still greater threat may yet await them: that which we call a primal. Needless to say, if we are to succeed, engaging with such foes can only ever be considered a last resort. And so I move that we seek to prevent them from being summoned in the first place.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes! Both prayer and aether are needed for the ritual. Should either one be denied, the summoning would fail!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Indeed. And so we must endeavor to discover the source of the aether on which the process depends. Do so, and it may present a way to halt the summonings─or perhaps even neutralize the towers entirely.

**AMALJAACHIEFTAIN:** A promising proposal. While you are conducting your investigations, however, we will need to remain vigilant, lest the Telophoroi commit further abductions, and summon primals ere we have the means to prevent them. To stand a better chance of keeping our enemy at bay, we would do well to coordinate our defensive efforts, sending reinforcements to assist our neighbors when needed.

**AYMERIC:** We Amalj'aa would have been overwhelmed were it not for our newfound allies. But say the word, and we shall come.

**000:** I see we are all in accord. But what are we to call this proud fellowship of ours? I submit that the honor of naming it should go to the Scion whose brave efforts have done so much to unite Eorzea. What say you, my friend?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? I would call it the Grand Company of Eorzea. I would...call it... One moment, please.

**ALISAIE:** But that's the name I...

**RAUBAHN:** Might I suggest the Grand Company of Eorzea? I remember a certain someone pondering it once upon a time, and it seems as fitting a name as any.

**MERLWYB:** A fine choice. For there is none here who does not love Eorzea!

**KANESENNA:** Aye! In that we shall ever be united!

**NANAMOULNAMO:** United in our gratitude for the realm that gave us life!

**ALPHINAUD:** Then let it be recorded that on this day the Grand Company of Eorzea was born!

**FOURCHENAULT:** How long have we dreamed of this moment? And now that it's here, I... Forgive me. Might we speak outside?

**KANESENNA:** Elder Seedseer, I thank you for granting me this audience. I am Fourchenault Leveilleur, here in my capacity as representative of the Forum.

**ALPHINAUD:** It is I who should thank you, Master Fourchenault, for journeying so far, and so swiftly. Would that our first meeting could have been under happier circumstances.

**FOURCHENAULT:** It has been too long, Father. You look well.

**ALISAIE:** As do you both. Ameliance will be glad to hear that you are taking care of yourselves.

**FOURCHENAULT:** How is Mother?

**KANESENNA:** She misses you terribly, of course, but is otherwise a picture of health. Circumstances apart, I am grateful that our meeting has afforded me the chance to be reunited with my children at long last. And I believe I also owe you thanks for the hospitality you showed my father, Louisoix, during his sojourn in Eorzea.

**FOURCHENAULT:** All thanks we owe to him. In the days prior to the Seventh Umbral Calamity, it was your father's tireless efforts which granted us a means to vanquish the primals. Were it not for him, our strength would have been quite spent by the time the Empire arrived. That Gridania still stands is in large part his achievement. He was a great man.

**KANESENNA:** He would doubtless have been moved to hear you say so. I must confess, however, that I opposed his decision to intervene. And my position remains unchanged.

**FOURCHENAULT:** “To chart the course of history, not to change it.” I am familiar with the Sharlayans' stance.

**KANESENNA:** It is more than that. It is our way of life. Who we are. But I came here not to deliver a lecture, but the Forum's answer to your request. Sharlayan will under no circumstances intervene in the conflict between Eorzea and the Garlean Empire.

**FOURCHENAULT:** ...May I ask for what reason the Forum has come to this decision? The Final Days spell the end not only for Eorzea, but the entire world. 

**ALPHINAUD:** The “Final Days”? Pray, spare me your hyperbole. This conflict is no more than the latest in a series of petty squabbles between yourselves and Garlemald. One in which Sharlayan will take no part. If the Final Days were truly upon us, we would know.

**ALISAIE:** Father, you must ask the Forum to reconsider. You may feel safe on your little island across the waves, but if you imagine the Telophoroi will leave you be, you are mistaken. They mean to kill us all, themselves included!

**FOURCHENAULT:** Alphinaud is right. We have seen what the enemy is capable of, the lengths to which they'll go. This is no time to turn a blind eye. If Eorzea falls, so too will Sharlayan. So if you truly love our homeland, you will join us─now, before it's too late!

**000:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. I thought you knew better than to raise your voice to your elders. It seems I was wrong. Wrong to ever let you leave Sharlayan. I consoled myself that your time abroad would instill in you some hint of restraint, of discipline. But I see now that Eorzea has made fools of you both. Have you forgotten why it was that I so vehemently opposed your grandfather's departure? For all his wisdom, his only solution was to go to war. Death. Devastation. Ruin. Even those who claim victory are scarred for life. What prize could ever justify such sacrifice? It is the duty of the learned to avert such tragedy. By fanning the flames of war, you forsake all you once held dear.

**FOURCHENAULT:** What will you say? Better to fight and fail than wait for the axe to fall. To ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom─it is indolence. It is in your power to save us. Refuse and you condemn us all.

**ALPHINAUD:** I see your friend shares your misguided ideals. But unlike her, you should know better. By espousing such barbaric notions, you subvert the teachings of Sharlayan and place all we have worked for in jeopardy. Alphinaud, Alisaie. As of this moment, you shall no longer bear the name of Leveilleur.

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Father...

**KANESENNA:** How you choose to live your lives is no longer my concern. If you wish to walk the path of ruin, I will not stand in your way.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Master Fourchenault! While Sharlayan may have no intention of intervening in this conflict, we can still part as friends. Will you not stay and speak with us, that we might learn of Sharlayan's hopes for the morrow?

**ALISAIE:** I have said what I came here to say. Any further discussion would be meaningless.

**ALPHINAUD:** Father, wait!

**ALISAIE:** Don't bother, Alisaie!

**ALPHINAUD:** How can you stand there and watch him walk away!? How can you let this happen!?

**ARENVALD:** Arenvald! I can't tell you how good it is to see you!

**ALPHINAUD:** It arrived a lot sooner than expected, eh? The day I crane my neck up at you...

**ARENVALD:** Only because you're sitting down. Unless...

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Fraid so. The chirurgeons say I may never walk again. Come on, Alphinaud. It could be worse. Besides, I didn't come here to dampen the mood. Quite the opposite. All I've ever wanted was to fight for a cause I believe in. But my fighting days are over. So I want you to fight in my stead. Be the hero I can't.

**ARENVALD:** I am no hero.

**000:** That's what they all say, though. No one ever calls themselves a hero. Even the ones who eat primals for breakfast. It's for others to decide. Look, Alphinaud... You already are a hero, to me and countless others. We see you doing your damndest to protect us all. And you're not alone, are you? There are people who believe in you, just as you believe in them.

**ARENVALD:** What will you say? We carry the dreams of many. We'll carry yours too. We'll be sure to give your regards to the Telophoroi. Some things may have changed, but the adventure isn't over yet.

**ALPHINAUD:** I know what's at stake, and how many people are depending on you. But I believe in you. Believe that you'll see it through. That's why I'm entrusting my dreams to you. Like A'aba and Aulie once entrusted their dreams to me.

**ARENVALD:** There was a time when I would have borne the weight of such expectations without a second thought. But now...I know just how heavy that burden can be. To tell the truth, I am beginning to wonder if I chose the right path. Sacrifices will inevitably be made for the sake of the ideals I uphold. Maybe I am not the person I thought I was. The person you think I am.

**ALPHINAUD:** I wouldn't presume to tell you. But I will say this... In spite of everything, you've come this far. The road ahead might not always be clear, but you've never been one to give up or take the easy way out. And everything you do, you do for others. For a brighter future. I'm proud to call you my friend. Well, I've said my piece, so I'll let you go. I know you've got more important things to be doing. Just...give what I've said some thought, all right?

**ARENVALD:** I shall, my friend. And we will meet again soon, I promise.

**FORDOLA:** Nothing left for me to do but wave and smile.

**ARENVALD:** You've got a pretty narrow view of what it means to be a hero, do you know that? You think they're all “forged in the fires of battle”? That it's all about being brave and killing villains? Alphinaud and the others will carry on their fight, but theirs isn't the only one. There are other ways you can make a difference─if you stop feeling sorry for yourself and put your bloody mind to it.

**FORDOLA:** There's not much chance of me living the quiet life with you around, is there?

**ARENVALD:** If you're content to twiddle your thumbs, thinking of what might've been, that's your lookout. But I reckon you've got some fight left in you.

**ALPHINAUD:** And I reckon you might be right. If there's a way I can still help my friends, I'll bloody well find it.

**THANCRED:** My fellow Scions... As I am sure you will have heard, we can expect no help from Sharlayan, nor are we any closer to discerning the Telophoroi's grand design. And now, our adversary moves against us in unprecedented numbers, compelling us to answer in kind. The outlook, in short, is bleak. Yet though our foes are many, and we but few, we may still tip the balance in Eorzea's favor.

**ALPHINAUD:** Of course. We will do what we always do: deal with the ones our allies can't. A less-than-daunting prospect, judging by your expression. Could it be that you've dispelled your lingering doubts, Alphinaud?

**ALISAIE:** Oh, I doubt I ever will. But as my friends have kindly reminded me, I have come this far, and that must count for something.

**ESTINIEN:** Gods be good, Alphinaud! That's what we've been trying to tell you all along.

**GRAHATIA:** For one so bright, you can be remarkably dim at times. There is such a thing as overthinking, you know.

**ALISAIE:** Might I suggest that we continue this conversation *after* the battle? It would appear the Telophoroi have already arrived.

**URIANGER:** I'll do what I can to cure the tempered, but they'll have to be incapacitated first.

**FANDANIEL:** Have care, my friends, for none can say wherefore our foe did choose this fateful field to be our battleground. Whatever may transpire, pray grant him not the pleasure of deterring you.

**IMPERIALSOLDIER:** And thus another plan went up in smoke! I am beginning to see why Lord Zenos thinks so highly of you... Not that this changes anything, you understand. You have merely earned yourself a stay of execution.

**ALPHINAUD:** Glory be...to...Garlemald...

**ALISAIE:** How fare the tempered?

**AMALJAAWARRIOR:** We've treated as many as we can. But some were beyond help...

**ALISAIE:** Do not hang your heads so, brave Scions. Though not all of our captured brethren could be saved, we are grateful for those whose minds have been restored. You could do no more. And that is enough. So please, hold your heads high.

**ALPHINAUD:** I should've been quicker... But I'll do better next time. Thank you for your kind words. They mean a lot.

**000:** A victory at great cost...but a victory nonetheless. We must stay strong and press on. Isn't that right?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? One battle at a time, we'll get there. To the very end. Well, you've come this far...

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**SYSTEM:** To the very end. It really must count for something.

**FANDANIEL:** Meanwhile, in the Garlean capital...

**ZENOS:** Those Eorzeans certainly are a stubborn bunch, though I suppose you knew that already. My plan to redirect the aether from Carteneau came to a rather less-than-satisfactory conclusion. It was, in many respects, an abject failure. Which does of course raise the question of where we are going to procure the requisite amount. The obvious solution would be to draw on resources a little closer to home, though that would require our dreamer to dream a trifle more deeply...

**FANDANIEL:** So be it. The dreamer will not complain.

**ZENOS:** Then let us begin the preparations at once. With the “gateway of the gods” complete, all that remains is to gather the necessary aether, and our prize shall be within reach! The time has come to fulfill your heart's desire! My desire! To relieve those wretched creatures of their meaningless existence!

**YSHTOLA:** While I await you, I shall drink a sea of souls and gorge myself upon the darkened moon. Then you shall come to me, all roiling rage and rancor... And the stars shall bear witness to our final contest.

**THANCRED:** As I thought... The aetherial currents have been disturbed here, too.

**GRAHATIA:** It was the same in Thanalan. Make that every location we surveyed.

**URIANGER:** And the strength of each current has diminished dramatically. Far more than could be attributed to a natural occurrence.

**ALPHINAUD:** What tidings bringest thou from Dravania?

**ALISAIE:** We took a number of readings, and noticed that the closer we were to the tower, the lower the aetheric density became. In short...

**THANCRED:** The towers are drawing upon the land's aether. Which would explain how they were able to carry out the summonings.

**MYSTERIOUSLADY:** Our allies must be informed of this. We should return to the Rising Stones and have Tataru relay our findings to them.

**ESTINIEN:** Hear me... Hear me... Darkness comes...and with it...the end... The fate...of the star...is in your hands...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**YSHTOLA:** They've almost finished loading our cargo. We should be ready to depart right on schedule, or so I'm told.

**THANCRED:** Excellent. 'Tis nice to have a smooth beginning to one's journey, at the very least.

**URIANGER:** It's funny... Master Louisoix came here on a ship very much like this one. And now, years later, the street urchin he befriended that day is bound for his mentor's homeland. With his mentor's grandchildren, no less.

**ALISAIE:** Aye, 'tis upon reflection that every twist of time's river and fate's whims are brought into sharp relief. Thou hast matured much in the intervening years. Wert thou not caught attempting to relieve Master Louisoix of his purse scant moments after he made landfall upon this dock?

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh really? Now that's a tale I'd like to hear!

**ESTINIEN:** Will this be your first visit to Sharlayan, Ser Estinien? ...Ser Estinien?

**ALPHINAUD:**  ... Are we strangers newly met? Why this stiff formality?

**ESTINIEN:** I...ah...merely meant it as a professional courtesy, since we are now colleagues in an official sense...

**ALPHINAUD:** I'd rather you dispense with the “sers,” especially in private company. Or I'll be forced to respond in kind. “Little Lord Alphinaud.”

**ESTINIEN:** You've made your point, Estinien. Painfully well.

**GRAHATIA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Better.

**TATARU:** Are you all right, Tataru? You seem positively distraught.

**000:** Distraught? Me? Don't be silly! I think it's lovely that they get to see their homeland. It's just...we're trying to thwart the schemes of an army hells-bent on destroying the world. And once again I have to stay behind and worry that this is the last time I'll get to see my friends...

**TATARU:** What will you say? I'll bring them back safe and sound. I promise. No sense worrying about the things we're powerless to change.

**HOARYBOULDER:** I'll hold you to that! Well that's hardly comforting!

**ALISAIE:** Ah, good, you're still here!

**HOARYBOULDER:** Hoary! Coultenet! What brings you all this way?

**LINERCREW:** We're to assist the Maelstrom and the kobolds with a lunar primal operation, so we thought we'd see you off before heading to the tower. F'lhaminn and the others wish you all a safe journey, and promise that they'll look after things here until you return. We will too, of course! Aye, we your fellow Scions of the Seventh Dawn will do our part to ensure the end of the world won't happen on our watch!

**THANCRED:** We're set to sail! All aboard for Sharlayan!

**ALPHINAUD:** It's time.

**TATARU:** Then we must delay no longer. We will contact you the moment we learn aught of value. Wish us luck.

**EMETSELCH:** Have a safe journey! And please, *please* be careful!

**HYDAELYN:** And so you venture forth unto the unknown. A fate beyond the horizon that cannot be divined. A future undefined and in flux. In uncertain times, naught but the simplest words of wisdom will suffice. That which lives is destined to die. Love leads to loss. Every beginning has an end. Treasure every moment, every step of your descent. And there in the depths where souls and stars rest─find your truth.

**GRAHATIA:** Hear... Feel... Think...

**HYDAELYN:** The day has barely dawned, my fellow earlier riser. Though we're hardly alone in that. Envious of those still sleeping soundly, no doubt. Called out to you, you say? Hmm. I've heard nothing myself. In any case, I daresay the sea air will do you good. Why not join the others on deck? Sharlayan should be coming into view at any moment.

**000:** (-???-)My voice yet reaches you. I am glad. (-???-)Hear, feel, think... And thus do we meet face-to-face at last. My Warrior of Light, guided by the Crystal.

**HYDAELYN:** What will you say? Why now, Hydaelyn? I can trust your words no longer.

**LINERCREW:** After your sojourn in the First, I believe you have your answer... You have visited the First. You...have every right to say that. You have gained an understanding of what I truly am. What Hydaelyn has always been. A primal. Zodiark was created to forestall the apocalypse which threatened the ancient world. And I was brought forth to bind Him. Yet seven times now, those who would orchestrate a return to that bygone era have rejoined a shard to the god I had sundered. The greater His strength grows, the swifter does mine own diminish. The power to draw your mind into the rift betwixt is no longer mine to wield. Yet though it taxes me sorely, I dare not leave these words unsaid. Even bereft of my guidance, you and your companions have accepted the burden of this star's troubled past. A conjunction has begun to form; an intertwining of your time and mine. Wheels shudder and turn. Conflict looms─monumental─which will decide the fate of this world and all life upon it. When you truly understand what is at stake, and your journey has prepared you to surmount the insurmountable... Then shall I honor the promise made in another time. Another age.

**HYDAELYN:** Cast yer peepers to the fore, folks! Sharlayan's just over yonder!

**ALISAIE:** I will not keep you further. Your traveler's heart must yearn to behold this unfamiliar land. We shall meet again...and soon.

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. What a fine morning. Oof. Still a bit stiff, though.

**ALISAIE:** And a good morning to you, too. Taken a look at the island already?

**THANCRED:** Then let's go, let's go! Might still be room in the prow if we're lucky.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah! The sleepers have arisen! There she is. Good ol' Sharlayan.

**ALISAIE:** Oh, I see it!

**ESTINIEN:** Home. Home at last. Well...maybe not in Father's eyes...but we'll manage on our own, if we must.

**URIANGER:** You do know you're not alone in this, don't you?

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed, 'tis as Ser Estinien sayeth. Forget not the comrades who boarded this ship at your side, I prithee.

**YSHTOLA:** Thank you, my friends. We are ever grateful for your steadfast support.

**EMETSELCH:** Upon arrival, we will be disembarking into the heart of Sharlayan proper. There is no greater concentration of wisdom in all the world. I am confident that, somewhere within that center of knowledge and learning, we will find the answers we seek.

**THANCRED:** Sharlayan, the solitary island nation of the northern seas. Where under the watchful gaze of Thaliak, patron deity of scholars, academics hoard all manner of knowledge and secrets. Once, they deigned to accept foreign students into a distant colony maintained in the Dravanian hinterlands. How swiftly they abandoned it once the first Garlean boot set hostile foot on Ala Mhigan soil. So averse to the prosecution of war, these men of wisdom. Your would-be allies...

**YSHTOLA:** I thought they'd never let us off the ship... What's next, then? Entry applications?

**ESTINIEN:** Hopefully they find no cause to deny us.

**YSHTOLA:** Hasn't Sharlayan all but severed relations with foreign powers? Those of us without direct ties─myself included─may be refused outright...

**ESTINIEN:** 'Tis true that, as a nation, Sharlayan only forms trade agreements with a select few neutral countries. But from a practical standpoint, an island cannot afford to be overly strict with its borders. Especially not if that island's people are wholly devoted to the accumulation of knowledge. If one submits the proper paperwork, with satisfactory evidence of identity and intent, then foreigners may be granted entry.

**YSHTOLA:** ...“May.”

**GRAHATIA:** Quite. So let us be absolutely clear on these points before we proceed. The immigration officer will ask for your affiliation and your purpose of visit. Considering Sharlayan's views on intervention, I strongly suggest we avoid any mention of the Scions. Krile has laid the groundwork for us to act as associates of the Students of Baldesion, and our ostensible reason for being here is to aid in their order's restoration. G'raha Tia, it might expedite our progress should an actual Student be seen at the head of our little group. Would you mind leading the way?

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** Of course. The immigration offices were this way, as I recall. Shall we? Greetings! We've just arrived, and are eager to make our way into the city. Would you be so kind as to process our entry applications?

**GRAHATIA:** Certainly. I see by your mark you are an Archon?

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** I am. G'raha Tia of the Students of Baldesion, at your service. I was assigned to an Eorzean survey team, but have returned to assist with the reformation of my order. My associates here will provide additional support.

**YSHTOLA:** Very good. I have paperwork detailing your group and its scheduled arrival for today. And it seems some few of your companions are also Archons. If you'll step forward, we can process those applications first.

**ALISAIE:** Y'shtola Rhul.

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** See how it glows? That list is aetherically linked with the citizen registry kept in the main repository.

**ALPHINAUD:** I've confirmed your status as Archons and amended your travel records accordingly. Welcome home. Now, who do we have here...?

**ALISAIE:** Alphinaud Leveilleur.

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** And Alisaie Leveilleur.

**ALPHINAUD:** Your applications have also been approved. Having said that... The streets are abuzz with talk of how House Leveilleur's lord disowned his young progeny. And while such personal circumstances constitute no reason to deny you entry, I urge you to avoid...exacerbating your present situation. Times are quite troubled enough already.

**GRAHATIA:** We shall keep that in mind.

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** These last two are not Sharlayan natives, but you will find their credentials are in order. An application was made in advance...

**000:** Hmph. Name and occupation?

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** What will you say? _WARRIOR_OF_LIGHT_. Adventurer by trade. _WARRIOR_OF_LIGHT_. Artisan. _WARRIOR_OF_LIGHT_. Champion of Eorzea.

**GRAHATIA:** An “adventurer...” Well, I suppose that is considered a valid calling in your native Eorzea, and it does indeed match the profile provided. You may enter. Indeed... Your profile describes you as an “adventurer,” but one also trained in the rather more constructive pursuits of procurement and production. You may enter.

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** And it is a title well earned, I can assure you!

**ESTINIEN:** An “adventurer” by trade is what your documentation indicates. No mention of this particular title─self-appointed, I take it? Either way, your employer seems willing to vouch for your character, so I shall─albeit reluctantly─grant you entry. “Champion.” And you, sir?

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** Estinien Varlineau. Formerly of the Order of the Knights Dragoon in Ishgard.

**KRILE:** “Formerly,” at least. And what, pray tell, is your “profession” now?

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** (-???-)If you'll allow me! My associate is a mercenary, hired for his strength at arms! Surely you are aware of the dangers we often face on our forays into the wilderness?

**KRILE:** Mistress Baldesion. If you insist on sponsoring his entry, then so be it. But while I appreciate that desperate times call for desperate measures, I find your choice of company concerning. Be advised that even a single misstep may have severe repercussions for your organization.

**ALPHINAUD:** I have every confidence in my chosen company, dear and trusted comrades that they are. But I thank you for your concern.

**KRILE:** Krile, it is good to see you.

**ESTINIEN:** Likewise! Long voyage notwithstanding, you all seem none the worse for wear. There is much to discuss, but this is hardly the place. Let's be on our way, shall we? No subtitles. Report if displayed. Welcome, friends, to Sharlayan!

**KRILE:** As your “mercenary,” I should hope my welcome includes a generous salary.

**URIANGER:** I had to say something, Ser Taciturn!

**YSHTOLA:** Pray forgive me. I was delayed...

**KRILE:** It's fine, Urianger. We're all here now.

**GRAHATIA:** Let's get down to business then, shall we? Come what may, we must prevent the Telophoroi's plans from coming to fruition. At present, I see two paths for gathering the information which may aid us in achieving that goal. The first involves an investigation into the change which has come over Sharlayan, not to mention the recent, inscrutable behavior of the Forum. As most of you know, the ninety-nine members of the Forum are elected from the general populace. This alone guarantees a plethora of opinion with regards to foreign policy. The Bibliothecs, for example, are a group of conservatives which would have Sharlayan focus on recording history, while remaining entirely uninvolved in the making of it. And at the other extreme, we have advocates for proactive diplomacy and direct intervention. My grandfather, Galuf, was one such member, as was Archon Louisoix. Yet despite our diverse factions and philosophies, the recent vote to deny Eorzea's request for assistance was unanimous. Even more concerning was the fact that many cited other, more pressing duties as justification for their recalcitrance.

**KRILE:** Fourchenault's refusal in Gridania had those same undertones. 'Twas as if, having stared unblinking into the face of impending doom, he'd simply turned away to pursue something more important. But what could that possibly be?

**URIANGER:** A mystery, indeed, and one which I ask for your help to solve. Our future may depend on it. As for our second potential path, it concerns a request made directly to the Students of Baldesion. Our organization was founded primarily to study strange and unexplained phenomena the world over. Mysterious relics and ruins, arcane disturbances, and so forth. Compared to our more isolationist Sharlayan colleagues, we have strong connections overseas─namely with scholars and academics who share our passion for the unknown. The request in question comes from one such acquaintance─Nidhana, an alchemist residing in distant Thavnair. Her missive describes the sudden appearance of a tower, and the subsequent summoning of what I can only assume is a lunar primal. In response to this threat, the satrap of Radz-at-Han─the individual who governs the city-state─has instructed the alchemists to find a means to deal with the spire.

**KRILE:** The artisans of that land are heirs to an ancient tradition─one rather unlike that of their Ul'dahn counterparts. 'Tis possible─nay, probable─that they have gleaned truths unattainable by Eorzea or her Far Eastern allies.

**YSHTOLA:** They do, in fact, appear to have a strategy in mind, though it will require further research. To that end, they have requested an introduction to a capable warrior shielded by the blessing of Light.

**KRILE:** Assuming we divide our forces to pursue both of Krile's lines of inquiry, then having you join the group heading to Thavnair would seem the obvious choice. But the investigation in Sharlayan is of vital importance as well. Equal, I think, to the Thavnairian one, given that the fate of the world may hinge on the results of both.

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, it is quite the quandary. Though it is a great imposition─and an altogether-too-common one─our efforts would be more likely to succeed were you to lead the charge on both fronts. You are indeed our champion. As to which task to tackle first, we will defer to your decision. Let us next decide how everyone else might best be assigned. As for myself, I shall continue what I've begun in Sharlayan. I should also like to steal the services of an Archon or two.

**GRAHATIA:** And thereby gain access to a greater range of reading material. I will help with that.

**ALPHINAUD:** Allow me to offer my assistance. I have some small amount of experience in the field of research.

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie and I would also like to help, if you would have us.

**KRILE:** Anything to understand even a fraction of what our father and the Forum might be thinking.

**THANCRED:** Of course, the more the merrier!

**ESTINIEN:** Right, the rest of us will make the journey to Thavnair. Thoughts? Objections?

**THANCRED:** I passed through Thavnair on my way to infiltrate the Empire, and though I'm not qualified to give a guided tour, I did gain a sense of where things lie.

**KRILE:** I'll be happy to have you along then. So for this group, it will be you, me, and Urianger.

**ALISAIE:** Give me a moment afterwards, and I'll supply you with all the details of Nidhana's request. Consider this hall our rendezvous point once our respective tasks are complete. May our investigations prove fruitful!

**EMETSELCH:** When our father disowned us, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It wasn't until much later that his words began to sink in. That I began to feel the weight of what it meant. Do you remember when the decision was made to come to Sharlayan? G'raha said that the Forum was determined to keep us in the dark, and that Father's venomous “performance” was part of that strategy. To keep us at arm's length. Perhaps it was. Father argued with Grandfather on many occasions, but never with such...dismissive contempt. And...when he demanded what justifies the sacrifices we make in war...I honestly didn't know what to say. Neither did Alphinaud, I know, but...never, for one moment, did I believe we had made the wrong choice. So all I could do was fume silently. It was only afterwards that I realized how childish I had been. How being stubborn and self-righteous must run in the family. If I could've just mustered a civil response, then things might've turned out differently... They must be ferrying goods to Labyrinthos. A vast complex beneath the island. Sharlayan is famous for archiving knowledge from around the world. Well, that knowledge is not preserved exclusively in dusty tomes and desiccated samples. Our “living” library─comprised of all manner of flora and fauna─is housed and studied within that underground facility. ...Still, that did seem to be an unusually large shipment. When I lived here, it was rare to even see such cargo transported by boat. Wait. Didn't you hear something in the Last Stand about the gleaners coming and going more than usual? I think they're the ones we saw manning those boats. And gleaners answer to the Forum... If the appearance of the Telophoroi prompted this sudden burst of activity, then Labyrinthos may hold a clue as to what the Forum is planning!

**KRILE:** Deep beneath the scholars' city shines a false sun within a fabricated sky. In any age exist those who consider the floor an extension of their bookshelves, and this vault's architects surely belonged to that special breed. If the stack grows too high, start a new one. If no room remains, then make more rooms. A simple solution at first. And then, bit by bit...a profound transformation. Knowledge buried beneath knowledge─a growing, creeping labyrinth from which there is no escape.

**YSHTOLA:** Not what you expected? I must admit, the artifice is very convincing. But I assure you that we are beneath Sharlayan itself. The breeze you feel, the flowing waters you hear─all created by the hand of man.

**ALISAIE:** The island is volcanic, you see, and once upon a time this great hollow must have been a reservoir for magma. It was discovered some four hundred years ago, at which point it was repurposed as a storage facility for scrolls and samples and such. Renovations have continued with nigh on no interruption to this day, with the lower levels still undergoing expansion.

**ALPHINAUD:** Aren't those people gleaners?

**ALISAIE:** Aye, judging by their dress. They are said to work alone, as a rule, but 'twould seem that rule is being enthusiastically broken today. It may be as you suspected─that they are engaged in a task apart from the norm.

**KRILE:** Let's spread out and get some answers, then!

**ERENVILLE:** Ugh... Did you call to me just now? No? How odd. I must be a bit dizzy from the descent. I-I'll be fine, I'm sure. Let's get to work, shall we?

**KRILE:** A fair shot. Nicely done! Let me truss this one up, and I'll make my way over to you.

**ALISAIE:** There you are. Any new revelations?

**ERENVILLE:** So you met with that gleaner again, this time to...capture a hornbill? I understand catching and bringing in creatures from the outside, but what's the point of chasing after ones already here?

**YSHTOLA:** Oh, it's a simple thing, really. Occasionally, we remove specimens no longer needed for study, or those we've had difficulty raising. But we can't simply turn them loose. Safely returning such creatures to their native habitats is another facet of a gleaner's duties. But not in this case, I'm afraid. I've been asked to bring the bird “below.”

**ALPHINAUD:** The restricted section in the lower levels of Labyrinthos. Open only to a select few researchers handpicked by the Forum. The projects down there are the subject of rumor and hearsay. Forbidden magicks. Advanced technologies that can never be allowed to fall into outside hands. Even Archons are not privy to the truth. Those who are─the researchers involved in this secretive work─are not permitted to walk freely in the city, and are instead required to live in isolated quarters.

**ERENVILLE:** What could a facility subject to such strict security protocols possibly need with a hornbill? An...an experiment?

**ALISAIE:** Possibly. I wasn't afforded an explanation. But judging by the requisition list given to me and my colleagues, I doubt it's for any kind of advanced research. I'd be more inclined to believe we were making preparations to migrate to the south. Meracydia or thereabouts.

**ERENVILLE:** What? Why would you say that?

**ALISAIE:** Much of the flora and fauna we were asked to procure could serve as reliable sources of sustenance. They're comparatively hardy species, too. Able to endure harsh climates. And among them are specimens known to be effective in improving soil quality and purifying water.

**ERENVILLE:** When you put it that way, migration does sound like a reasonable assumption.

**YSHTOLA:** That's all it is, though─an assumption. Through our tasks, we gleaners glimpse only bits and pieces of the Forum's plans. Our prime concern is that our requisitions, be they living or otherwise, are properly preserved for the knowledge of future generations. Now, I really must be going. I regret that I cannot reward you as you deserve.

**ERENVILLE:** Perhaps you might reward us after a fashion, then? It is imperative that we reach the lower levels. And seeing as you are already set to descend with your assigned cargo, mayhap we could accompany you as your...assistants?

**YSHTOLA:** I am afraid that won't be possible. Once the animals have been prepared for transport, we send them down separately via the lift. I will, of course, follow after to make my report, but I can hardly pass you off as porters when there is nothing left to carry.

**ERENVILLE:** ...Indeed. Pray forget I said anything.

**KRILE:** How do you feel about climbing? If you've strength and the courage to brave it, then there is another way down. This path leads to the thirty-third facet─a mineshaft excavated during one of our expansions of Labyrinthos. While I cannot guarantee that the passage is safe to traverse, it should provide access to the Medial Circuit below.

**ERENVILLE:** I never even knew such a place existed! Thank you, this is the perfect solution.

**ALISAIE:** You're quite welcome, but consider yourselves warned. If the going proves too treacherous, you'd do well to turn back. I bid you good day.

**BOTANISTMAN:** Well, turning back is hardly an option, not when we've come this far. Let's go and take a look at this mineshaft.

**YSHTOLA:** (-???-)Hard to look away, isn't it? But they're more than pretty flowers. “Heartblooms” are attuned to ambient emotion. No subtitles. Report if displayed. You don't seem convinced. But believe me, it's true. This ashen grey, for instance. It mirrors the anxiety and urgency of those working nearby as they rush to fulfill sudden orders. Intense feelings like those spur the petals to change color. Bright, glowing hues in the presence of joy. Dark, subdued shades for frustration or despair. Yet even with the collected wisdom of Sharlayan at our disposal, we've yet to identify the underlying principle of this empathic effect. And there are other mysteries besides. Although the flower is extraordinarily long-lived, its low reproductive rate has made it difficult to find younger populations growing in the wild. With too few sightings to map its distribution, and no closely related species to track, we've been unable to pinpoint its land of origin. To further complicate matters, every culture even dimly aware of its existence has given it a different name and mythos. Our attempts to study it via the historical record have been an exercise in frustration. As an avid botanist myself, I should one day like to unravel the heartbloom's secrets...but I'm afraid other duties must take precedence. I will leave you to your thoughts.

**ALISAIE:** Have you learned aught of interest? A flower that reacts to one's feelings? Strange... I must say, I have never heard of such a thing.

**ALPHINAUD:** This is all very fascinating, but as it stands, we've failed to gain any significant insight into the Forum's undertaking.

**ALISAIE:** Indeed... While there is certainly enough activity to support Erenville's supposition that a priority has been placed on improving food production... Unfortunately for our investigation, these workers were never informed as to how their duties serve the master plan.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ugh. If only we could interrogate the Forum members directly. Isn't that the entrance to the Archeion? Look, there... I think that's Erenville.

**YSHTOLA:** A little difficult to tell from here, but...but I think you're right. He did say he was coming down to make his report.

**ALPHINAUD:** Erenville receives his orders from the Forum. Would it not follow, then, that the superior to whom he reports is a Forum member─or at least a close associate?

**YSHTOLA:** You mean to eavesdrop on their conversation!? What of the risks?

**ALPHINAUD:** Ours alone to bear. We won't interfere with Erenville's work, nor will he be implicated as an accomplice. If you're not comfortable taking part, I can do this alone.

**ALISAIE:** Nay. I said myself that I wished to know Father's intentions. And no answers will be forthcoming should we simply ask nicely.

**YSHTOLA:** We can apologize later should it come to it. Right now, we need every crumb of information we can get our hands on. Consequences be damned.

**KRILE:** It might be best if you came along as well. In fact, we should all... Krile?

**YSHTOLA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Oh! Yes! That certainly sounds like a plan!

**ALISAIE:** I'm glad you agree...

**KRILE:** Quickly, Erenville is on the move. We need to get closer before we lose him!

**REQUESTEDLEGISLATOR:** Almost. I can almost reach you...

**ERENVILLE:** I trust you will find your compensation to be more than satisfactory. We wish to make clear that we are pleased with the efficiency and thoroughness of your work. So much so that we have come bearing new tasks in need of your competent hand.

**REQUESTEDLEGISLATOR:** Another lengthy list. If I may speak frankly. The gleaners have been pushed to the point of collapse by your unending demands. We are not familiars to be exploited. We are Sharlayan scholars, and we deserve an explanation for this unseemly treatment. What warrants such urgency?

**ERENVILLE:** ...In an age long past, Sharlayan was charged with a momentous duty. And now that word of the Final Days hangs heavy in the air, the time has come for us to fulfill that charge. I can say no more, but I promise you this: all will be revealed in due course. And when it has, you will understand that your toil was in service to the greatest good.

**REQUESTEDLEGISLATOR:** Then I will do your bidding. For now. But unless you wish the gleaners to rise up in protest, I advise you to offer tangible improvements for our working conditions. Your promised revelation does nothing to address present circumstances.

**ERENVILLE:** A fair point. Your concerns will be conveyed to the Forum.

**ALISAIE:** I hope that was informative. You may consider my debt to you repaid in full. While I do have my reservations about the Forum, I want to believe that they have our best interests at heart. Which is why I'm reassured that you're busy sniffing out the truth of things. We can ill afford to place all our eggs in one basket─this master plan of theirs─without first understanding the risks involved.

**ERENVILLE:** Wait, how did you know it was us?

**KRILE:** If you mean to impersonate a toad, try studying the real thing. And don't try to fool an expert.

**HYDAELYN:** For you. The spell will keep it from wilting. She said you would need it for the journey ahead. Will you speak with Her now? I cannot hope to match Minfilia's clarity, of course, but... (-Hydaelyn-)...Thank you.

**KRILE:** (-Hydaelyn-)...Thank you. (-Hydaelyn-)Do not worry. She has lent me her body for only a moment. (-Hydaelyn-)Just as I could not save the First from the Flood of Light, it has become arduous for me to interact with the physical world without assistance. (-Hydaelyn-)Though I might converse with you for a time, the incorporeal form I assumed on the ship would be incapable of casting even the simplest enchantment. (-Hydaelyn-)It is in the depths of the aetherial sea─the place to which all life returns─where my influence is greatest. (-Hydaelyn-)After Minfilia's sacrifice on the First, it was to the sea, here in the Source, where I ferried her soul. I wished that gentle spirit to find rest in the world she loved so well. (-Hydaelyn-)Her...and another who may yet have a part to play. Though that will depend on you. (-Hydaelyn-)Take the flower. Walk free. For you are free─to go where you wish. To believe what you will. (-Hydaelyn-)That bloom will be your guide. Test and proof of your conviction. (-Hydaelyn-)In darkness seek joy. Surrender not to sadness, and see beyond despair. Walk free, and bear the light for others to follow. (-Hydaelyn-)Together, raise it aloft and let it shine. Till the end, blinding and radiant.

**ALISAIE:** That was...all too brief. Already She seems so far away... My apologies if I startled you. Ever since we began our descent into Labyrinthos, I had sensed another's will, straining to reach out. Even with my particular talents, though, I was unable to make a connection at first. So weak and tenuous it was... Once I took hold of that wispy thread, imagine my surprise to discover it was Hydaelyn Herself! Needless to say, it seemed wise to learn what we could before letting go. Her answers were more cryptic than I would have liked... But at least She left us with a guide of sorts─that unusual flower. Yes, we are definitely making progress!

**KRILE:** You can't be serious! We've done nothing wrong!

**YSHTOLA:** Master Fourchenault!? What business has the Forum with us?

**FOURCHENAULT:** Obstruction and suppression, apparently.

**ALPHINAUD:** Mistress Baldesion. Our records show you facilitated the Scions' entrance into Sharlayan by claiming them as assistants for your organization. We are aware of your “investigations.” After alerting the major institutions to the presence of potential troublemakers, we received word from an Archeion custodian. A group operating under the auspices of the Students skulking about Labyrinthos and engaging in clandestine behavior.

**FOURCHENAULT:** “Clandestine”? We may not have entered Sharlayan as Scions, but we did naught to conceal our identities. Our only purpose in this city is to seek the truth. I can think of no reason why our actions should warrant the Forum's intervention.

**YSHTOLA:** 'Tis not our way to discourage the pursuit of knowledge. But the timing of such pursuits must be considered, not to mention their potential impact. With the world in chaos, we, the true caretakers of wisdom, have committed ourselves to an undertaking that demands the utmost discretion. And we will not risk its success by turning a blind eye to disruptive foreign elements in our midst.

**FOURCHENAULT:** What, then, is to be our fate? Will you put us on a ship back to Eorzea?

**ALISAIE:** The Forum will convene to examine your case. The results of said inquiry will determine your future in this city. As for your absent companion, he has already been detained.

**FOURCHENAULT:** G'raha!? But why? Is reading a crime now, too!?

**YSHTOLA:** Reading is encouraged. Celebrated, even. Not, however, of the volumes shelved in the restricted section of the library.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Refusing to comply will only make matters worse. Let us instead treat this as an opportunity to open a dialogue with the Forum.

**GRAHATIA:** Silence is often one's best defense. I would advise against prolonging the proceedings with frivolous discourse. But enough─this is not the place for debate. The Rostra awaits.

**YSHTOLA:** Forgive me. I was careless...

**BARNIER:** We would have been detained regardless. This way, at least, we manage to stay together. I trust your time within the forbidden archives was well spent?

**FOURCHENAULT:** The Forum will come to order! This inquiry is now in session. As Speaker Elect, I will be presiding over the day's proceedings. Master Fourchenault. Would you be so kind as to restate the matter which compelled you to summon your colleagues with such urgency?

**LEGISLATORA:** As you are all aware, we recently denied Eorzea's request for Sharlayan assistance. Since then, certain individuals dissatisfied with our decision have taken it upon themselves to interfere with our work. They entered our nation masquerading as associates of the Students of Baldesion, but these malcontents are better known as the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. These militants wield influence with both the Eorzean and Eastern alliances, and are inextricably involved with the crises presently afflicting the world at large. Loose in our city, these warmongers sought to meddle with and expose matters of state secret. What are they if not a dire threat to be expelled!?

**KRILE:** You have tarnished the good name of the Students. Galuf would be ashamed...

**YSHTOLA:** Galuf Baldesion was never one to forsake his fellow man. Even if this nation closed every door and retreated from the world, he would have found a way to help the Scions─help every soul of this star─fight back against the coming doom.

**GRAHATIA:** A terrible enemy stands poised to lay waste to all we hold dear. In the face of such madness, Eorzea reached out to Sharlayan, a respected ally, in the hopes of forming a united front. Was your curt dismissal truly the best you could offer?  Or are you so preoccupied with your “momentous duty of an age long past” that even the end of the world is unworthy of your attention?

**YSHTOLA:** Whence came this revelation?

**GRAHATIA:** From the mouth of a Forum member within fortuitous earshot. From the mouth of a Forum member within fortuitous earshot.

**YSHTOLA:** Then it seems your findings support my own... The reason I visited the restricted shelves was to study records of the Forum's policy-making process. To better understand the historical trends underlying their most major decisions. At first glance, the positions of neutrality in war and the accumulation of knowledge above all else appear constant and consistent─the unchanging pillars of Sharlayan society. And once upon a time, I might have left it at that. These days, however, I am more attuned to the subtleties of governance, and so I noticed something...odd. From a particular point in time, the purpose of these policies shifted. No longer was knowledge preserved for the benefit of society. Rather, society was to be gradually reshaped to ensure the preservation of knowledge. The most conspicuous and telling change was the one which befell Labyrinthos. Once little more than an oversized storehouse, an enormous allocation of funds saw it transformed into an advanced research and archival facility. I also discovered a fascinating account on the finances of our Dravanian colony. The settlement attracted students from far and wide, and the connections and tuition fees thus acquired were funneled into further improvements for the archives. Now, there is no question that our nation's progress is tied to the acquisition of wisdom. Nevertheless, the vast resources diverted for this purpose borders on the obscene. But returning to the matter of when─our change in course appears to have been made some two hundred and seventy years ago...

**LEGISLATORB:** The very same period when Sharlayan scholars in the hinterlands began a formal study of the aetherial sea! You found something, did you not? And whatever it was gave rise to your oh-so-important duty...

**FOURCHENAULT:** Mind your tongue, Archon! If you had seen─!

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, we are bound by a duty we cannot ignore. Knowing this, what would you have us do? Abandon our vital work, and join you on the field of battle? We will never choose the way of the sword. We will fulfill our mission not through strife and bloodshed, but survival. Come what may, we shall live on. We must.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Do as you must then. But we Scions will fight─until the heavens fall, until our last breath.

**ALPHINAUD:** Such misguided zeal...

**MONTICHAIGNE:** Father, I... Master Fourchenault. I fail to understand the stance you have elected to take. But by the same token, I have yet to find a compelling argument to counter the challenge you put to us in Gridania. Still, in the midst of my uncertainty... I must trust in myself to do what is right. As others have chosen to trust in me. So I will continue as I always have, weighing the consequences of my every action, and allowing my hope for the future to inform my decisions.

**ALISAIE:** That's quite enough! Have you all forgotten the reason for this assembly?

**MONTICHAIGNE:** Scholarch Montichaigne. He's the head of the Studium, and an old friend of my grandfather's.

**BARNIER:** Honestly, every discussion devolves into some interminable debate. Terrible habit. Let's return to the topic at hand, hm? By their own admission, these Scions have resolved to fight alongside the Eorzean nations against the doom which swift approaches. But there exists no evidence of an attempt to incite our citizens to do the same. Furthermore, while our decision may well've been the correct one, we cannot simply bull our way through these disagreements without inviting doubts or objections. Put yourselves in their place! Who among you would leave a tome unopened if an elder forbid you read it with no reason given? No, if we're to quell further discontent, then we must conclude this matter with a fair and even hand.

**EMPLOYEEMAN:** Order! We will have order! Master Montichaigne raises some valid points. Keeping such concerns in mind, I propose we enforce the following measures. Until further notice, the Students of Baldesion are to cease any and all activities within the domain of Sharlayan. You will also refrain from any further investigation into the Forum's decisions and duties. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in the immediate expulsion of your Scion associates. Let us put this judgment to a vote. All in favor, raise your hand! I count fifty-one for, and forty-eight against. The proposal is passed. Students, Scions, you have heard the Forum's judgment. Pray abide by it or face the consequences. Honored members, I thank you for your time. This inquiry is concluded!

**EMPLOYEEWOMAN:** Welcome home, my lady.

**ALISAIE:** Welcome home, my lady.

**000:** What? What are you gawping at?

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? House Leveilleur in all its grandeur! Scion headquarters must seem squalid indeed... Just admiring the craftsmanship.

**AMELIANCE:** Oh gods, please don't! It makes me feel like a spoiled princess. I'll have you know I'm quite fond of the Rising Stones! Oh, I...I suppose I never gave the décor much thought. I'm glad that you approve. I think.

**EMPLOYEEMAN:** Lord Fourchenault is not to hear of this visit. And I should also like the children to have their gifts ere my husband makes his return.

**EMPLOYEEWOMAN:** As you wish, my lady.

**ALPHINAUD:** Master Alphinaud, Mistress Alisaie, if you would accompany me upstairs...?

**AMELIANCE:** We shan't be long.

**ALISAIE:** The twins have been sending letters home from time to time, recounting their latest adventures. I am sure they withhold certain details, of course. If only to keep me from worrying... Yet a mother worries all the same. In the early days especially, I tried to support them as best I could, sending the Scions coin and other such donations. Fortunately, they have found the strength to overcome adversity time and time again. Their words grow more confident with every letter, their depictions more vivid. The triumphs and defeats. The joys and sorrows. 'Tis clear that they have come to find value in every experience. But of those they treasure most, it would seem that meeting you might be the most impactful. Why, since that fateful day, I do believe there has not been a single missive in which you were not mentioned by name! No subtitles. Report if displayed. 'Tis plain they care for you. And I am glad they have such a steadfast companion watching over them. Under normal circumstances I would offer you tea, but alas, these are anything but. In any event, why don't you keep me company whilst we await my children's return? Perhaps you might regale me with a tale or two of your exploits?

**AMELIANCE:** When you mentioned gifts, I wasn't sure what to expect. Mother, I...

**ALISAIE:** Oh, look how well it fits you! And the style is to your liking?

**AMELIANCE:** It's perfect─exactly what I would have chosen! But please, tell me you had something different made for Alphinaud...

**ALPHINAUD:** Naturally! You are hardly little children anymore. And while I shall miss dressing you in those precious matching outfits, I must respect the individuals you have grown to become. See for yourself!

**AMELIANCE:** Thank you for the splendid clothes, Mother. Stylish, comfortable, and eminently practical!

**EMPLOYEEWOMAN:** I am so glad you like them. They are, however, missing one final touch.

**ALPHINAUD:** If you would allow me, Master Alphinaud...

**AMELIANCE:** Wait, are these...!?

**ALPHINAUD:** ...A sage's tools of the trade. They belonged to your father. Though he may as well be chained to his desk these days, as a student, he was often called upon to venture into the field. He wielded those armaments, both to heal and to harm, in no few battles. None so fierce as those you two have braved, perhaps, but battles nonetheless. Thus did I pull them out of storage─to show you that he was not always the man who stands in vehement opposition to you now. And also because it would be a terrible waste of ridiculously expensive, House Leveilleur-commissioned artistry. I am told these devices are quite difficult to master, but someone of your extensive experience should soon have them darting about with grace and aplomb. May the wisdom in that crystal serve you well. And please, try to find common ground with your father, that you might come and go without need for this awful subterfuge.

**AMELIANCE:** We will, Mother, I promise!

**ALPHINAUD:** My final gifts to you, before you run off, are an observation and a suggestion. Firstly, Fourchenault has ever been a serious man, but it was only after you were born that he truly lost himself in his work. I may not know the Forum's inner workings, but I know your father's. The timing of that change in him holds some significance. Secondly, do not seek to best your father with words. Far better that you simply show him─let him discover the merit of your actions *after* they cannot be undone!

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. Oh, Mother...

**AMELIANCE:** We shall take your wisdom to heart. Thank you again for these gifts, and farewell for now!

**KYTTE:** Safe travels, my children. Eat well, stay warm, and keep your friends close.

**ESTINIEN:** Right, we're all set! Just the four of you, was it?

**KYTTE:** Three. I am already attuned to the crystal in Thavnair.

**THANCRED:** You are? Oh. I would have preferred more test subjects... Oh well, never mind. If our three travelers could line up here, please? Yes, right there is fine! Take a deep breath, and I'll soon have you soaring through the aether. Oh, and one last thing! You might experience a teensy-weensy touch of violent aetherial sickness. Good luck!

**EMETSELCH:** Wha─?

**ESTINIEN:** Thavnair, home to city-state Radz–at–Han. Rising from the southeast waters of the Bounty, this isle of plenty served as the battleground for a conflict between two peoples. Their cultures bled into one another until a unique amalgamation was distilled from the chaos, in a process not unlike their precious alchemy. Once solidified as a single nation, an adamant stance of neutrality would hold invaders at bay. For a time. Now across this vibrant isle creeps a fog of malice. What choice do you have... ...what chance... ...against such an insidious foe?

**THANCRED:** I've seen fairer faces after a bout of bad shellfish. Let me bring you something to drink. That should help settle your bellies.

**NIDHANA:** There was a note...with Krile's instructions... Don't let Estinien roam the markets alone... He's alarmingly bad with coin... No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ESTINIEN:** (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)Mmm...

**THANCRED:** What happened here?

**URIANGER:** Their dress marks them as alchemists. I see no evidence of injury or poison.

**THANCRED:** Thinkest thou they but slumber?

**VARSHAHN:** I believe so. Whether it is by *choice* is another question entirely.

**NIDHANA:** (-???-)Oh, we have guests. (-???-)You must excuse the poor welcome. Long days and longer nights have taken their toll, as you can see... I am Varshahn. Servant to the satrap. My task was, in fact, to wake these good men and women. If you will allow. People of the Great Work! I come bearing new scales!

**VARSHAHN:** (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)Mmm... Scales...? (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)We have new scales!?

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKA:** Yes, my friends. Gather round. I have them right here.

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKB:** Oh, happy day! Now I can continue my experiment!

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKC:** Many thanks!

**ESTINIEN:** One for me!

**VARSHAHN:** Those are dragon scales.

**NIDHANA:** Yes─such materials are vital to their most pressing research.

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKA:** (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)And we are fortunate to have them. Our experiments are so close to bearing fruit... (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)Soon we will have a talisman capable of nullifying the aetheric emissions from that accursed tower! (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)Did...did I say something wrong? Are you not here with Varshahn? Wait, who *are* you people? (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)Of course! You're the one Krile sent─the “Warrior of Light” we've been waiting for!

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKB:** This is a day of celebration! Praise be to Cinduruva!

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKC:** The winds have shifted. I feel it! The end to our toil is near!

**ESTINIEN:** I feel it, too. My head hasn't been this clear in days...

**VARSHAHN:** Tell me, how did you acquire those scales?

**ESTINIEN:** Curious that it concerns you so. But worry not. They were freely given by the dragon with whom our satrap has forged a lawful pact.

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKA:** ...That is well.

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKB:** You must be quite familiar with dragonkin, yes?

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKC:** Is this their congealed blood I see on your weapon?

**ESTINIEN:** Hrm... Speaking of dragon blood...you yourself have been infused with it, have you not? I should like to draw a phial or two, if so!

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKA:** Now, see here...!

**ESTINIEN:** Come along, come along! I must *insist* that you visit our laboratory!

**NIDHANA:** Cease your shoving, or so help me...!

**000:** (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)Oh dear, your poor companion. What with the new scales and your timely arrival, my colleagues are a little giddy with excitement. (-Arkasodara Alchemist-)No harm will come to him, I promise! Meanwhile, shall we find a quiet place to talk? As you may have guessed, I am Nidhana─the alchemist who sent the request to your Mistress Krile. We have workshops across the nation collaborating on this research project, but it is here─at the Great Work─where I collate our results. Come with me, all of you, and I can explain the crux of the situation. Yes, that would be Radz–at–Han. Hardly anyone has been allowed in or out since our troubles with the tower began. The fearful citizens huddle inside the city walls, and commerce has all but ground to a standstill. I pity the satrap the trials he must be facing.

**NIDHANA:** What will you say? What can you tell me of the satrap? Do you trust the satrap?

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKA:** Well, he... He is the most important person in Radz–at–Han. Completely! Without the satrap and his line, Radz–at–Han would not exist. Long ago, this island was home to two tribes of Matanga─the Gajasura, and the Arkasodara. When the Au Ra came to these shores, it was the Arkasodara with whom they joined forces. Together, they defeated the warlike Gajasura, forcing them to flee Thavnair altogether. Peace and prosperity reigned for a time, until a clan of Hyur from the mainland decided they wanted the island for themselves. It was a direct ancestor of the present satrap who arbitrated that conflict, and welded the warring factions into the nation we know today. And ever since, a member of that esteemed lineage has inherited this somewhat unique position. You see, by and large, the state is run by the people, but when problems arise, it is the satrap who mediates a solution. The stability provided by the satrap is what has allowed Radz–at–Han to thrive all these years. And it was the satrap himself who entrusted us with this duty. We will not fail him, nor our countrymen!

**FANDANIEL:** What is the delay with the vessel!? I told you, I need to adjust those ratios!

**AMON:** I come all this way to admire one of my splendid towers, and what do I find? Fools attempting to ward off its tempering influence with magic trinkets. I seem to recall a similar experiment in ages past. What *was* that man's name...? “O” something... Oween? Another body, another time. Who could be expected to remember every trivial detail...

**THANCRED:** Another body, another time. Who could be expected to remember every trivial detail... Hmmm. Allowing them to construct such handy talismans would be counterproductive to my plans... And yet, I find myself deathly curious. How *will* they manage this feat with the limited knowledge and resources at their disposal? Complications be damned. For we cannot escape the nature of our souls. And I, as ever, am my own worst enemy.

**ESTINIEN:** I see our taskmasters have allowed you a moment's respite as well. You have to hand it to these alchemists─they are determined to see this endeavor of theirs succeed. I've never been one for blind optimism, but I sincerely get the sense they're close to a breakthrough.

**URIANGER:** They had better be, or all this effort was for naught...

**THANCRED:** The peoples of Eorzea, of the Far East, of Thavnair... Children of this star united in common cause against a dire threat. Yet ere they succumbed to suicidal madness, were not the Telophoroi born of Her body, as were we? They who cling to life and the promise of the morrow's dawn, 'gainst they who desire death and an ending of their own orchestration. The victors of this war alone will hold the right to answer the question of existence. Of its meaning, and its worth.

**ESTINIEN:** Poetic and ominous to a fault. That said, if it's an existential debate in nature, then our arguments might not be as persuasive as you'd think. Fandaniel wants to die, and take everyone with him in an orgy of pain and suffering. An utterly vile and unforgivable idea. And yet, when spat upon by fate and wailing in the deepest pit of despair, who among us can say they have not entertained similar thoughts? There are nights black as pitch. Bereft of hope. When no words of comfort can reach you, and it's all you can do to grit your teeth and choke back the bile.

**THANCRED:** The more you see and suffer life's injustices, the more difficult they become to bear. Vengeance is nurtured in similar soil. Though your anger has a broader focus, the sentiment is much the same: a fervent desire to destroy others; to see them drown in torment, as you have.

**URIANGER:** That about sums it up. The will to endure is not always as strong as the urge to burn it all down and salt the earth, survival be damned. It's a struggle─often close and brutal.

**THANCRED:** Indeed... Well. I, for one, shall pray survival proveth more appealing in the end.

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKA:** As will I. Besides, our chances are much improved when we've the company of others committed to the cause of life. Our vengeful dragoon here is proof of that. What is it? What did you see? Fandaniel? Are you sure? If he knows we've been working on a countermeasure...

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKB:** It holds...the vessel holds! This is the one.

**NIDHANA:** At long last!

**URIANGER:** Look! We have finally created a talisman strong enough to withstand our experiments! We've named it a “warding scale”─for the time being. With this in your possession, your soul should be completely shielded from corruptive aether.

**NIDHANA:** Afforded such protection, any one of us may approach the towers without fear. Thou hast mine admiration─'tis an invention of historical significance.

**000:** I thank you for your kind words! But I would prefer you keep them unsaid until we test the talisman's efficacy in the field. It is for the next stage of our plan that we summoned you in the first place: to accompany me to the Tower of Zot. Should the scale prove effective─as I very much hope it will─then you'll have little to do. But should the effect be weaker than anticipated, I must ask that you restrain me. Or knock me senseless.

**NIDHANA:** What will you say? Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Oh, you needn't ask.

**ALCHEMISTOFTHEGREATWORKC:** Either way, we are fortunate to have you with us.

**NIDHANA:** Nidhana, I... Are you certain you wish to do this?

**THANCRED:** If others are to trust our creations, then we must have faith in them first. And as the senior researcher, it falls to me to lead by example. But...should I fail to return, then learn what you can from this attempt and apply it to the next. Our work must continue. Is that clear?

**NIDHANA:** We'll keep an eye on the place while you're away. Assuming Fandaniel is lurking about, there's no telling what mischief he has in mind for us─or you. Be on your guard.

**FANDANIEL:** Shall we be on our way? I'll have one of the soldiers at the hatchery prepare us a boat, and we can set out from the northern shore. I'll see you there. We should soon cross the threshold of the tower's influence... Any moment now... It's working! And you─you are still yourself? Then I'd like to see how it fares closer to the tower, if we could. So far, so good. The scale's protection appears to be holding. If we can just make it to the tower's entrance... A few more steps! Praise be to the Sisters! We made it! And the scale has proven itself to be everything we hoped it would be. Now we can focus on production. Once we've equipped and returned with an entire survey team, this menace will soon give up its secrets! What─!? Aaah! Let me go! ...Let me *go*! Rrrgh!

**NIDHANA:** Oh, do calm down. You'll only hurt yourself thrashing about like that.

**FANDANIEL:** Stop! You can't do this! Please!

**000:** A little late for heroics, I'm afraid. Hmm...the similarities are striking. My, my, such *hostility*. Never before has my artistry so displeased. My patrons of old would've positively squealed in delight! Though, between you and me, I find gushing praise exhausting.

**FANDANIEL:** What will you say? Patrons of old? What are you talking about?

**AMON:** Allow me to tell you a story. Surely you've yet to hear the one about Fandaniel, the sundered Ascian. I inherited the position─and the soul─of the Fandaniel who sat on the Convocation in the time of the Final Days. Theoretically speaking. Practically speaking, that fact is of no consequence! I was born and lived as...well. Me. Eventually I was recruited into the Ascians and imbued with the former Fandaniel's knowledge and memories, but I never felt that they were truly a part of who I am. How to explain? Perhaps if I told you who I was before my Ascian embrace. Although that chapter, too, is a past I've long since discarded. I have it on good authority you've poked your nose into an Allagan ruin or two, yes? Then I expect you've heard of me. The old me. Amon, at your service.

**ALLAGMAN:** Amon, at your service. Imagine a nation of unbridled prosperity. Every need, met; day after day of unbroken, unshakable peace. Existence, fulfilled. And ripe for decay.

**AMON:** You are a genius without peer, Amon. How ever do you conceive of such delightful experiments? That fool was beside himself with panic when he awoke with the head of a bull! Even his cries for help emerged as so much guttural lowing! Oh, the memory of it... Haha, my poor sides! My friends and I were so consumed by laughter we struggled to breathe!

**XANDE:** No more than entertainment for bored wastrels ignorant of its worth. My all-consuming work... But it was not their only indulgence. For they were ever hungry for stimulation. Slaves to the slightest hint that amusement was afoot. Our nation was ailing...but I would see the poison purged. I resurrected a legend─our first and greatest emperor. And just as I had planned, he set our wayward empire back on the path of conquest. An inexhaustible ambition carried us onwards, always onwards. Yet he who delivered to us such glory was not to be satisfied.

**EMETSELCH:** Heed me, Amon. No matter how vast one's empire, or full one's treasure vault, all is rendered meaningless by death. In the end, all is lost...

**AMON:** You know as well as I that the emperor stands to lose this war. And so I have come to claim you. For while your methods leave something to be desired, we cannot deny the results of your work. And as fortune would have it, the seat of Fandaniel─your rightful seat─lies vacant and waiting. Take your place amongst your peers, rather than die a pointless death amidst the ashes of your doomed nation. Send one of your clones to the Crystal Tower that you might see for yourself. See what lies ahead...

**FANDANIEL:** The fall of the empire affirmed the truth. Majestic and tragic...as the emperor foresaw. Scheme as you like, build as you will. Nothing endures. What is life, but a brief jaunt ending in emptiness?

**EMETSELCH:** (-Fandaniel-)So easily distracted! Why, I almost left without saying farewell. (-Fandaniel-)As for your friend, you needn't worry─these pawns are far more useful to me alive as fuel for the primals. (-Fandaniel-)Ah ah ah! If you attempt to pull them free, they *will* die, so─enjoy tackling that conundrum with your comrades! (-Fandaniel-)We shall meet again! Not in one of these minor spires, oh no, but somewhere more suitably grandiose. Your favorite playmate is ever so eager to see you.

**VARSHAHN:** A vast rock squats upon Thavnair, and to its stony surface clings the city of Radz–at–Han. Ye who enter here are subject to the scrutiny of gods─the gate's most watchful eye. The orb which beholdeth the truth of all things. Pass beneath its hot and piercing gaze, bearing down like a second midday sun. The fragrant haze a mixture of sweet incense and acrid smoke. The cries of merchants mingled here with lively melodies accented by dancers' feet. Travelers seduced by vivid sound and colors were once swallowed up by patchwork streets. But no such scenes to savor now. To what somber present does that divine eye bear witness?

**THANCRED:** Here we are: Meghaduta. It seems a shame to bring you here directly. Under normal circumstances, it would have been my pleasure to show you the sights.

**VARSHAHN:** And it would have been our pleasure to see them. Alas, it seems our tour of the city will have to wait.

**AWAHEEN:** I am afraid so. Come, we should head inside. Your Excellency, may I present our honored visitors.

**000:** (-His Excellency-)Ah, splendid, most splendid! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ahewann, satrap of Radz-at-Han. Our alchemists tell me your assistance was invaluable in the creation of the warding scale. Such deeds ought to be recognized in person, thus did I have young Varshahn convey you here forthwith. On behalf of my people, may I express to you our sincere gratitude.

**AWAHEEN:** What will you say? But Nidhana, she was taken... Not everything went to plan.

**ESTINIEN:** A regrettable incident, indeed. I assume you speak of Nidhana? A regrettable incident, indeed. Her colleagues insist that we honor her wishes, and trust in the talisman─that it will be instrumental in saving Nidhana and the others. I am eager to hear your opinion on the matter, so let us not stand on ceremony. Come, sit.

**AWAHEEN:** I think not. This charade has gone on long enough. Show yourself.

**VRITRA:** Forgive me, but were you expecting musicians perhaps? There are no performers waiting in the wings at present, but arrangements could be made if you'd prefer─

**AWAHEEN:** (-???-)Nay, he hath the right of it─the time for artifice is past. Raise the curtain.

**VRITRA:** As you wish.

**URIANGER:** (-???-)You travel as assistants to the Students of Baldesion, but you are known to me. (-???-)Even here have we heard of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. I am Vrtra, and for years uncounted hath this isle served as mine abode.

**VRITRA:** Vrtra! Of the first brood, sibling to Hraesvelgr and Nidhogg!

**THANCRED:** Aye, mine elder brothers. Of Midgardsormr's spawn, I was last to hatch.

**AWAHEEN:** Well, isn't this a surprise! We were told Radz–at–Han had an alliance with a dragon, not that a great wyrm sat in the satrap's own hall...

**THANCRED:** A necessary subterfuge, as the true tale of our nation's history illustrates most effectively. In the beginning, the rock upon which our city is built was home to Vrtra, and Vrtra alone. In time, the ancestors of the Matanga came to the island and established a foothold, but never did they dare disturb the wyrm's lair. Next to arrive were the Au Ra. Adopting the example of their Arkasodara allies, they too treated Vrtra with reverence and respect. And for many years, an understanding between our forefathers and the great wyrm endured... ...Until marauding Hyurs from the mainland came, threatening to shatter our peace and tranquility. When it seemed all would be drowned in blood, Vrtra himself came forth and quelled the rising conflict. A peaceful accord was reached, and oaths sworn in Vrtra's name. Thus began the dragon's governance of the fledgling state which was to grow into Radz–at–Han.

**AWAHEEN:** But... If Vrtra is still here, then your position as satrap is just...

**VRITRA:** ...A “charade”? Yes, and one which my family has performed faithfully for generations.

**ESTINIEN:** Many envy the great wyrms their power. Were it known that I ruled here, then the fires of war would burn without end. I would not be the flame which consumeth my people. Those few who joined me in laying our country's foundations were, perforce, sworn to secrecy.

**VARSHAHN:** Your eye. It was taken?

**ESTINIEN:** 'Tis here. Buried within this semblance of flesh. The body before thee is but a simulacrum, constructed by the finest artisans of Radz–at–Han. With mine eye nestled within, it doth serve as an inconspicuous vessel for my will.

**VARSHAHN:** Ah. That would explain why I felt the presence of a dragon upon our first meeting.

**VRITRA:** I am woven with wards fashioned to deceive such arcane senses. Though 'twas short-lived, it seemeth thy fusion with my brother hath left thee much altered, Estinien Wyrmblood. From the very first, we sensed the nature of one another. Yet did neither one of us bare his fangs. That is all I need know of thee for now.

**URIANGER:** With my secret thus revealed, I have for you a proposal. Not as a wyrm of the first brood, but as the ruler of Radz–at–Han. With all haste must we take in hand the finished talismans and breach this foul spire. Thence, should it lay within our power, dispel its wicked influence. Yet even with the assurance of the warding scales, the narrow confines of the tower doth limit the size of our force.

**VRITRA:** And thus denied strength in numbers, thou must choose thy soldiers with care.

**THANCRED:** Just so. Yet though our Radiant Host is formidable, I see a surer path before me. Thou and thy comrades have contended with a multitude of primal beings. Most recently thou didst cast down false gods in Paglth'an and Carteneau, I am told. 'Tis upon that strength I would call. The Scions have proven themselves most capable, and I ask that you serve as the tip of our spear. Talismans would, of course, be provided for each of thy companions. And should you agree to this undertaking, more will be provided to make use of as you see fit.

**VRITRA:** There's no denying it's a dangerous proposition, but the rewards may far outweigh the risk. Just think of what we might accomplish if we could equip all our allies with warding scales. I worry, however, that even the four of us may be too few for what you have in mind. Might we regroup with our friends first to discuss the matter?

**THANCRED:** 'Tis no trifling task that I have laid before you. Go, steel your hearts and hone your plans─such time as you require shall we spend in crafting your protective charms.

**VRITRA:** It seems a quick trip back to Sharlayan is in order...

**ESTINIEN:** Wilt thou not lend thine aid?

**VRITRA:** Whether your request be made as a great wyrm or the ruler of Radz–at–Han, I see no reason to refuse. Nor will I.

**KRILE:** I am in thy debt.

**YSHTOLA:** Your time in Thavnair has certainly been eventful. In my opinion, carrying out Vrtra's request and assaulting the Tower of Zot should be our highest priority.

**ALPHINAUD:** I agree. While I still have questions concerning the Forum and their grand undertaking, we have all but exhausted our avenues of investigation. Simply pressing them any harder on the subject will almost certainly result in our expulsion. Therefore I suggest we explore the aetherial sea connection by way of a letter to Master Matoya, then make our way to Thavnair.

**YSHTOLA:** I wonder... Even with the protection these talismans afford us, what can we hope to achieve once inside the tower? According to Arenvald and Fordola's report, they were unable to free the Amalj'aa. Worse, their attempts triggered the tower's defenses, which led to a summoning of Lunar Ifrit.

**URIANGER:** What does it tell us that the spires even have such defenses? Simply pulling a prisoner from the wall is fatal, thus the direct approach is doomed to failure from the outset. Any further measures to dissuade such actions seem...unnecessary. Unless, of course, there *is* a way to free the prisoners without killing them. Then it stands to reason that any intruders would be met with overwhelming force.

**YSHTOLA:** The towers appeared throughout the world in but the twinkling of an eye. 'Twas by magical means these structures were raised, I surmise. A spire thus conjured must needs be maintained, and I suspect an arcane catalyst─some manner of “core”─doth lie hidden within. Destroy the core, and the tower ceaseth to be...thus liberating the captives without harm!

**THANCRED:** So we can hope. And I would prefer to enter the tower with a working theory than with no plan at all.

**GRAHATIA:** Assuming Y'shtola's reasoning is correct, the chances of the defenses remaining dormant are small to none. Any primals will have to be dealt with, and defeating one will likely only lead to the summoning of another. Our every victory will only compound the prisoners' suffering.

**000:** May we not then divide our forces? Those proficient in healing will focus on sustaining the captives. That duty can be covered by Urianger, Krile, Y'shtola, and myself. The remaining Scions will proceed with the search for the core. Admittedly, this strategy puts both parties at greater risk, but it should bolster our chances of saving the Arkasodara by a considerable margin.

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? Are you sure Alphinaud is in the right group? What of Alisaie? She knows a healing spell or two. Aren't you forgetting someone!?

**ALPHINAUD:** If you're to fight primals, then you'd best have at least one healer with you.

**GRAHATIA:** And I am more than happy to fulfill that role. I've found wielding a sage's armaments to be rather intuitive, and look forward to testing them against a more challenging foe.

**ALISAIE:** That she does, but I think Alisaie herself would assert that she's at her best when she's charging unto the breach. And from what I recall from the Grand Cosmos, there's a spring in her step when she fights by your side.

**GRAHATIA:** Ye gods, will you never let me hear the end of that? Rest assured that I will do what is asked of me regardless of who I happen to be standing next to at any given time!

**KRILE:** Of course not! As our most talented healer, we need you leading the van, fighting primals on the front lines.

**THANCRED:** It seems we have a plan; all that remains is to carry it out. I will inform Radz–at–Han of our movements, so let us make our preparations and regroup near the tower.

**KRILE:** The military post in what's left of the Hamsa Hatchery should serve as a convenient staging point.

**GRAHATIA:** That sounds perfect! And remember: the experimental aetheryte at the Confluence is there for those who need it, so there's no excuse for being late! Is everyone all right!?

**KRILE:** We fortified the captives with what magicks we could. Have the defenses been disabled? All appears quiet for the moment...

**URIANGER:** The lower floors were disturbing enough, but this place feels...wrong. The aether is heavy and thick. Like wading through a quagmire...

**YSHTOLA:** I believe we stand in the tower's beating heart. What sayest thou, Y'shtola...?

**ESTINIEN:** I see it. Aether siphoned from the land runs up through the spire, flowing to a single point... This is the core we seek. Yet something is...off. As large as this structure is, it siphons far more aether than is required to sustain it. 'Tis as if the core is feeding on the energy. Consuming it. I need to take a closer look... ...Curious. There is something there, embedded inside the core. A man's limb...

**YSHTOLA:** This is what we came to destroy?

**ESTINIEN:** Yes. If you would be so kind?

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALISAIE:** And that should be the end of it!

**URIANGER:** Ugh, what now!?

**ALISAIE:** My theory that the tower might come crashing down following the core's destruction doth appear to be correct.

**GRAHATIA:** Bully for you! And how are we supposed to survive the fall!?

**YSHTOLA:** What of the prisoners below...!

**GRAHATIA:** The floor beneath our very feet dissolves. Brace yourselves!

**ALISAIE:** I pray I'm not too late!

**ALPHINAUD:** What happened? Where are we?

**KRILE:** By my reckoning, we're still on the island where the tower stood but...'tis as if it never existed. Hardly a scratch. But how...?

**THANCRED:** G'raha wove a levitation spell at the last moment. Large enough to catch everyone, it would seem.

**KRILE:** That explains the lack of obvious injuries.

**THANCRED:** The expenditure of so much aether has taken its toll. He will need plenty of rest, but should otherwise be none the worse for wear.

**ALISAIE:** Then the immediate problem is what to do with our new friends here. They'll be much changed for their time in the tower. Even if their bodies are intact, I doubt we could say the same for their minds.

**THANCRED:** Angelo and I will take care of that.

**YSHTOLA:** I have every faith in you, Alisaie, but there are just too many for you to treat alone.

**VARSHAHN:** We'll send at once to Eorzea for more porxies, and call on the local mages to lend a hand.

**URIANGER:** Hail, Scions! We were watching the tower, when it simply...disappeared. What happened here?

**VARSHAHN:** The threat is banished, and thy people delivered. They are, however, in need of treatment, and we of a secure locale and helping hands to assist us in its provision.

**THANCRED:** You shall have all this and more. Come, let us convey these unfortunate souls to the city.

**AWAHEEN:** ...Are we the last to arrive? I hope we've not kept you waiting!

**GRAHATIA:** Not at all. Your comrade is feeling better, I trust?

**AWAHEEN:** Much better, thank you. Hannish remedies are certainly potent─in more ways than one.

**GRAHATIA:** One becomes accustomed to the taste, although I hope you never have cause to do so. Pray take your ease.

**VRITRA:** Full glad I am to see you all unharmed.

**AWAHEEN:** Valiant Scions. For your heroism, you have my boundless gratitude. You cast down that dire tower and set free its hapless captives. You cleansed their souls of its corrupting influence. No words of thanks will suffice. In place of platitudes, I offer a bounty of warding scales. Pray accept your due reward, along with the goodwill of Radz–at–Han.

**ALPHINAUD:** Alchemists throughout the land were put to work in the forging of your talismans. The finished ones have been collected, and now await you at the High Crucible of Al-Kimiya. Present this letter when you are ready to take them into your possession.

**ALISAIE:** We are humbled by your generosity. Know that the inventive wisdom of Radz–at–Han will be vital in restoring serenity to our star.

**VRITRA:** Every single one of those scales came from you, didn't they? You must still be in such pain...

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Tis of no moment. A mere annoyance compared to the dreadful suffering inflicted upon this land and its people.

**VRITRA:** Albeit brief, my involvement in the Dragonsong War afforded me a glimpse of the myriad sorrows which consumed both dragon and man. Though you were half a world away, such tragedies as befell your kin must have affected you deeply. And yet you chose to live among men.

**YSHTOLA:** In the age when that conflict first bloomed, my choice had already been made. In some distant place, man slew dragon, and dragon slaughtered man. Yet no hate could I muster for those smiling faces which did look to me for guidance. Not even my brother's righteous rage could rally me to his cause. I huddled here, secret and still, hoping against hope that which I had built would remain untouched by the chaos and carnage.

**VRITRA:** 'Twould seem we share the same desire for peace, great Vrtra. To that end, I wonder if we might trouble you with another question. The Telophoroi are intent on recreating the Final Days, an apocalyptic event which we know to predate the sundering of the star. As the longest lived among us, know you aught of this terrible cataclysm?

**YSHTOLA:** Nay. When war and strife drove my sire from his home, he crossed the great expanse with only our unhatched eggs as company. He alighted upon a shattered Source, its thirteen reflections long since scattered beyond the rift. Of events preceding his arrival, he knoweth naught save that which Hydaelyn hath deigned to disclose.

**VRITRA:** I see... So again, 'tis the inscrutable Hydaelyn to whom we must look for answers.

**YSHTOLA:** Seek you to divine the will of this star? If so, I have a tale which may afford you some small comfort. 'Tis a story from my youth, many, many years ago... To my sire, I once posed the question, “Of all the stars in the sky, why didst thou settle upon this one?” To which Midgardsormr did reply, “'Twas the last bastion of hope.” He believed, so long as Hydaelyn endured, so too might dragonkind. Solemn and portentous were his words. What deeper meaning they held, I could not─dared not─pursue. 'Tis a stone I've left unturned ever since. Yet take you solace in the knowledge that, whatsoever Hydaelyn doth strive towards, 'tis an ideal which hath earned my sire's conviction.

**THANCRED:** Thank you, Vrtra. You've given us warm reassurance in a world gripped by cold uncertainty.

**KRILE:** While I'm sure we all have a great many questions, I think it's time we collect the talismans and be on our way. Our fight against the Telophoroi is far from finished.

**VRITRA:** We must take our leave, but please do inform us if we can provide any further assistance.

**000:** Prithee, a moment. There is one whom my sire hath judged worthy of honor and respect─the one known to men as Eorzea's champion. This hero of renown and rumor...'tis thee.

**VRITRA:** What will you say? Midgardsormr and I have crossed paths, yes. I've not spoken with your father in some time... I only wish he could be here with us now...

**ALPHINAUD:** I knew it to be so. From man and dragon alike have I learned of thine exploits. In accordance with the covenant he forged with Hydaelyn, the stewardship of this star hath ever been his purpose. Silence in the face of thine actions is the greatest sign of his approval. I know of his clash with Omega, and the long slumber which was his price. Yet even closed in sleep, my father's eyes are far from blind. He is watching over thee; watching over this world. 'Twas a revelation most pleasing that thou─a child of man─had gained Midgardsormr's trust. But alongside mine elation runneth a rivulet of dread. For upon thy life's reel wind too many threads. Of fate. Power. Weal, enmeshed with woe. Amidst this tangled knot, thou shalt know no rest. 'Tis an endless confluence of forces; a struggle without surcease. More terrible still is the attrition wrought upon thy companions, as they are swept up in the storm of thine existence. Take heart and protect them well. They will be your strength and your salvation. The hope thou wilt need come the end. Even cowering behind my curtain, I know the suffering of the powerful. I have watched my siblings driven mad by loss. Thus do I exhort thee to spare no effort to keep thy loved ones safe.

**ALISAIE:** Ah, apologies. We hadn't meant to interrupt.

**VRITRA:** It's just that we *do* have a history of suddenly collapsing, and when you didn't follow us out...

**ALISAIE:** 'Tis I who must apologize. I have detained your champion overlong with idle chatter. Go. At war's end, I pray I welcome thee back into my hall, where together with thy joyful comrades you may toast your triumph.

**YSHTOLA:** These are the talismans we were promised?

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes, and I made a quick count: there are far more than we could have hoped for. Enough to outfit an entire company of soldiers, in fact. Considering the involved process, that they were able to manufacture so many in such a short span of time is nothing short of a miracle.

**YSHTOLA:** Once we have distributed them to our allies in Eorzea and the Far East, we'll have a fighting chance to bring down the other spires─just as we did with the Tower of Zot.

**URIANGER:** Or, we could use them to invade Garlemald proper, and strike directly at the Telophoroi's base of operations... Of course, we would need to consult with various Alliance leaders before such a drastic measure could even be contemplated. To which end I could set out forthwith and present the idea to each of our allies in person.

**THANCRED:** Pray allow me to undertake some few of those journeys. I find myself restless, and in need of purposeful duties.

**YSHTOLA:** I can head eastward. Bozja and Dalmasca are just a short hop from here, and Doma's shinobi network should come in handy for passing on the word.

**NIDHANA:** We shall share the burden, then. Meanwhile, I think it best that you and the others take the talismans back to the Baldesion Annex. We must keep them safe and secure until we've decided upon a course of action.

**THANCRED:** Please, I must speak with you!

**NIDHANA:** Nidhana!? You're awake!

**ALISAIE:** Yes. When I spoke with the carer at my bedside, she told me that one of the Scions─a young woman─had cleansed me of the tower's corruption. It seems I've been asleep ever since the treatment... But when I awoke and learned you were all still here, I knew I had to come.

**NIDHANA:** As you said, Nidhana was captured only recently. Such a brief exposure is swiftly cured, so I tended to her before we gathered at Meghaduta.

**URIANGER:** And I am truly grateful that you did! I cannot thank you enough... All of you─for everything you've done. Destroying the tower, rescuing our people...you've saved Thavnair from an awful fate!

**NIDHANA:** Yet who hath truly saved whom? Due in no small part to thine inspirational courage, the alchemists were successful in reproducing warding scales of proven efficacy. Replications of thy work now stand ready to travel across the seas, unto the hands of those who might wield them against this rising evil.

**KRILE:** The talisman? Is this true!? I was so groggy from sleep, I didn't even think to ask. Our great work, sent across the seas... It was worth it. It was all worth it!

**NIDHANA:** Look at that! Its color is completely changed!

**KRILE:** What do you have there...? How unusual. I wonder if the effect is a reaction to akasa.

**NIDHANA:** I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that term.

**ALPHINAUD:** Akasa? It is one of the unseen energies defined by Hannish alchemical theory. Though a gross oversimplification, some describe it as an essence influenced by feelings.

**NIDHANA:** You imply that it is distinct from aether?

**YSHTOLA:** Foreign scholars often conflate the two, but we see them as separate concepts. Aether is an energy which permeates the land. It exists within animals, objects, even the air we breathe, affecting all through which it flows. Akasa, on the other hand, exists in a domain beyond our reach. A gift bestowed from on high─or torn from the heavens, in some traditions. Akasa can neither be created, nor destroyed. It is beyond our power to purposefully alter or manipulate. The only thing observed to influence it is an abundance of...I want to say “spiritual emotion.” As a veteran of the battlefield, surely you've experienced moments of desperation or exaltation when you've transcended the usual limits of your capabilities? That is a manifestation of akasa, the invisible essence harnessed by heart, mind, and unyielding spirit!

**NIDHANA:** I really must hear more about this theory! Our disciplines are based entirely upon the idea that aether is the fundamental form of all energy.

**KRILE:** I'm glad my haphazard explanation has piqued your interest. But even for us, akasa is a somewhat abstract field of study. A lack of practical application lends itself poorly to formalized research. Which is why my analysis of your flower can amount to little more than idle speculation. I am sorry...

**ALPHINAUD:** Nonsense, you have nothing to be sorry for. Your insight is much appreciated!

**THANCRED:** Shall we depart for Sharlayan, then? I will see to it that the talismans arrive at the annex.

**VRITRA:** And we will be in touch once our talks are concluded. I suggest you rest while you can─from here onward, sleep is bound to be in short supply.

**ALISAIE:** Take heart and protect them well.

**GRAHATIA:** Good, you're here! You haven't eaten yet, have you? We've brought quite a spread if you're interested. Only the finest dining from the Last Stand!

**ALISAIE:** No subtitles. Report if displayed. No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**GRAHATIA:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**ALPHINAUD:** No subtitles. Report if displayed.

**KRILE:** Lest you wonder, we invited Estinien as well. But he refused with a rather grim-faced “No, thank you.” I suspect Sharlayan cuisine is not to his liking...

**ALISAIE:** Oh, I don't know about that. Perhaps our lone wolf just needed some time apart.

**ALPHINAUD:** What, to perfect his brooding stare!? Next time, I'll drag him out by the ear, sit him down in front of a Sharlayan feast, and see that he eats every last bite.

**KRILE:** An excellent idea. Of all people, warriors must take proper meals and rest if they are to maintain a healthy constitution.

**GRAHATIA:** Poor Estinien, beset on all sides.

**KRILE:** Speaking of one's physical condition, Mistress Krile, I hear you recently played literal host to Hydaelyn Herself...

**ALISAIE:** And what an experience that was. Tiring, yes, but no lasting harm done. If anything, I should have liked to speak with Her longer... I've not felt a hint of Her presence since.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hydaelyn instructed you to carry that flower, yes? 'Twill be your guide─“test and proof of your conviction.” And then something about seeking joy in darkness, was it? Come to think of it... Isn't that what happened with Nidhana, back in Radz–at–Han?

**GRAHATIA:** The flower did seem to radiate a joyful glow. As if reflecting the elation we all felt. The relief of a people with renewed hope.

**ALISAIE:** Indeed. And in turn, I felt buoyed by that radiance. 'Twas akin to spotting a beacon, and knowing we were on the right path. I know we've not yet triumphed over the Telophoroi, or learned the full breadth of the Forum's plans... But even within the midst of our struggles, we find small moments of joy to sustain us. Rare and hard-won, perhaps. But it is this pursuit of happiness that gives us the strength to carry on, day after day... Hey! That's mine!

**GRAHATIA:** To the swift, the spoils! Though I recall that levitation spell of yours was quick enough.

**ALPHINAUD:** Only barely. And even at my best, I'm still too slow to wield it effectively in battle. Mayhap I simply require more practice with this new magick...

**GRAHATIA:** You unearthed it from the depths of Noumenon, I presume?

**ALISAIE:** Aye, and from a veritable mountain of arcane tomes, at that. 'Twas...necessary to facilitate my solitary explorations.

**GRAHATIA:** Or, to put it simply, you used it to sneak around the forbidden archives.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, yes, well...after a fashion... They're tall, you see... The shelves─they're too tall for me! And I could hardly move the library's platforms without attracting attention now, could I!?

**ALISAIE:** Ohhh...

**KRILE:** Ohhh...

**000:** Ohhh...

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Are we pushing on until dawn? Shall we call it a night? You do know these are “my” quarters...?

**ALISAIE:** I'm not that ambitious. But 'tis pleasant to idle away the hours every once in a while.

**KRILE:** One last cup of tea, then. Dickon said this brew helps relax the mind before bed...and gave us some leaves for free!

**AMON:** Why else did you think we were here? Surrender to thy fate, O champion!

**ZENOS:** Ah, enjoying the bracing cold, I see. Do you not own a warm coat or a cloak? Something in fur or fashioned from the skins of your enemies, or...? Well, never mind that. I come to you once more as the bearer of bad news. Our tower in Thavnair has been toppled, and I need not tell you by whom. Given how many we have at our disposal, the loss of a single spire is hardly fatal to our plans. It does, however, slow the rate at which we siphon aether. If they continue to preoccupy themselves with the towers, then all will be well. But should our foe prove bold enough to strike at us here, then the timing becomes...questionable.

**AMON:** Our foe is bold enough. Of that, I can assure you.

**ZENOS:** Yes, very well, then... I suppose I must prepare a proper welcome. Honestly, talk of your nemesis is the only thing you seem to enjoy. Does nothing else spark your interest?

**AMON:** Hmm... No. All else is...equal. Equally tedious. Equally disappointing. The world is a tepid bog into which we sink, too weak to thrash as the mud clings to our eyes and fills our throats till we blissfully choke. But then came the light. Blinding and pure and hot─so very hot. Enough to set my soul aflame. I basked in the afterglow...until the void yawned once more. And then I knew the muck would never claim me again. There was naught for me ahead, so I drew the curtain on all that had come before. Burn, burn. Let the whole star burn. I will have my contest. I will reclaim my moment.

**ZENOS:** How wonderful that the emptiness of death has not dissuaded you from committing your life to its pursuit once more. I don't know whether to envy you or pity you...

**AMON:** You question my disinterest, but what of yours? Despite your noisome antics, I sense you take little pleasure in this endeavor.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, I remember you.

**MONTICHAIGNE:** I pray we have not caught you at an inopportune moment. We wanted to offer our thanks for your kind words in the Forum.

**KRILE:** Well, I could hardly let that inquisition go unchallenged. I've always believed that curiosity should be nurtured, not stifled. Thankfully, a majority of my colleagues agreed. A slender majority, aye, but a majority nonetheless.

**MONTICHAIGNE:** Had the vote not gone our way, we would be having a very different conversation, if any at all. Though I'd like to think you would have not given up on our cause─I'm told you paid a visit to the annex afterwards?

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes, that's right. I was hoping to speak with the grandchildren of my dearly departed friends Galuf and Louisoix in a less dour setting, but it seems I'd just missed you. I still can't believe how much you've grown. If only your grandsires could've seen the way you presented yourselves to the Forum. Why, it fair brought a tear to my own eye! You must have the patience of a saint, putting up with this lot and their antics─never mind Matoya's prize student. Luckily, I know a thing or two about managing unruly younglings. If you ever need advice, don't hesitate to ask!

**MONTICHAIGNE:** If I may, there is a rather more pressing matter we wish to discuss. What can you tell us of this “duty” that the Forum must fulfill?

**ALISAIE:** Nothing, I'm afraid. Like all humble servants of the Forum, I am sworn to secrecy. Or rather, I couldn't tell you if I tried. Our duty is of the gravest importance. Furthermore, if the particulars were made public, it would incite widespread panic. As such, those entrusted with this duty have been bound by an enchantment, which prevents us from speaking of such matters without the express permission of the Forum.

**MONTICHAIGNE:** How is that even possible!?

**000:** Hahaha... It's been some time since I last gave a lecture. Please, take a seat. Ahem! We shall begin by reviewing the fundamentals of aetherology. The aether which imbues us with life can be categorized into three forms. Two are of the incorporeal sort, the soul and the memory. Can anyone tell me the third?

**MONTICHAIGNE:** What will you say? Corporeal aether! Magic! Ummm...

**ALISAIE:** Yes, very good! Not entirely inaccurate, but nor is it the answer I was looking for. That would be “corporeal aether.” The answer is...corporeal aether. This is the form with which the layman is most familiar. Consumed by even the simplest of daily activities and replenished by the food and drink that sustain us, this form of aether is in constant flux. In contrast, the aether that comprises the soul is rarely subject to dramatic change. The same can be said for memory, as the two are intrinsically linked. Picture the soul as paper, and memories as words written upon it. Now, what would happen if that paper was doused with ink─the same type of aether as comprises the memories?

**MONTICHAIGNE:** It would blot out everything that was written.

**ALPHINAUD:** Precisely. We would be unable to recall the memories, and any activities that depend upon them would be hindered as well. In fact, this exact phenomenon was observed on a vast scale not so long ago. And what might that have been?

**MONTICHAIGNE:** The Seventh Umbral Calamity... The people of Eorzea vividly recall Bahamut breaking free of the lesser moon and raining hellfire down upon the realm. But no one could seem to remember the events that followed immediately afterwards.

**KRILE:** Indeed. To this day, we have yet to determine whether it was an unintended consequence or a deliberate act. The enchantment which binds me and the rest of the Forum is based on a similar principle. And yes, it is a contravention of the Sharlayan prohibition against the practice of memory manipulation. Only when a new member is inducted and told of our great duty are they subjected to the process. A necessary evil. You have my word that it would never be used to manipulate the populace.

**MONTICHAIGNE:** I should hope not. But can this enchantment be dispelled and your memories restored?

**ALISAIE:** If nine-tenths of our members give their approval, then the process may be reversed. Then, and only then, would we be able to speak freely to others of our sacred duty. Barring that, we must wait until we return to the aetherial sea... For there we will be purified. The blots upon our souls washed clean... And our memories drift apart and dissolve. Rather defeating the purpose, I suppose. But there are those memories that are indelibly etched upon our souls, some believe.

**MONTICHAIGNE:** What happens after that?

**ALPHINAUD:** We are reduced to pure aether, coalesce with that of others, and create souls anew. Alternative schools of thought assert souls remain whole and return to the corporeal world, reborn into another form. Both theories have their proponents. Personally, I consider each equally probable. Well, I think that's enough education for today, now that I've given you some food for thought─or rather, an entire banquet! I would remind you that although I'm unable to assist you with certain matters, the resources at my disposal may still be of use to you. I'll arrange for you all to be given the run of Phenomenon. Of course, as associate to our alumni and the Students of Baldesion, this privilege is extended to you as well, my friend. Oh, and I suggest you speak with Qih Aliapoh. She's well known among the artisans of Sharlayan, and her network of contacts may prove useful in your search for knowledge. I wish you all the best in your pursuits, wheresoever they may take you.  

**THANCRED:** By the Twelve...

**YSHTOLA:** Glad you could join us. I hope you don't mind, but we went ahead and started without you.

**LUCIA:** As you can imagine, our traveling companions were eager to become acquainted. 'Tis a rare thing indeed to see such a diverse and talented group of individuals assembled for a single purpose. We fight not only for the sake of Eorzea, but for the entire world─including the people of Garlemald. Much rides on the efforts of the Ilsabard contingent.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. Which is why I am glad to find myself in the company of many trusted comrades─yourselves included.

**LUCIA:** Lucia!

**ALPHINAUD:** I have come at the behest of Lord Aymeric, who has honored me with the role of Ishgard's representative. For the good of all nations, not least my former homeland, I am determined to see this mission through to its end. We have a hard road ahead of us, but walk it we shall. Together.

**LUCIA:** We too welcome this opportunity to work together once more. I have faith that, if there is a way to resolve this conflict, we will find it.

**ARUHNSENNA:** Allow me to introduce you to the rest of our company. Everyone, if I may have your attention! Might I ask you to speak first?

**SICARD:** If I must... I am A–Ruhn–Senna, spokesman for the Gridanian delegation, here on behalf of my esteemed sister, the Elder Seedseer. We shall provide support and protection to those in need during our time in Garlemald. To that end, I am joined by healers selected by the Conjurers' Guild, with the Order of the Twin Adder's finest serving as our escort. Of course, with an experienced white mage such as yourself accompanying us as well, those requiring more involved treatment will be in safe hands. Raya–O sends her regards, by the way.

**GRAHATIA:** S'pose I'd better say my piece...

**SICARD:** Wait─I know you!

**LYSE:** The name's Sicard, in case you've forgotten. Truth be told, I'd rather you had forgotten... Anyroad, the Admiral asked Captain Hyllfyr to send his best, and for whatever reason, he picked me. 'Course, if I'd refused, I'd be the laughin' stock of the Bloody Executioners, and my reputation's taken enough of a keelhaulin' as it is. But more importantly, like any pirate worth his salt, I know when you're starin' down a storm, you've got to trust in the commander of your ship. So if the Admiral wants us to go to Garlemald─not for plunder and glory, but the promise of peace in our time─then that's what we'll do! Since we all know how much the Empire loves its steel, we thought we'd bring along a few smiths to make the most of it. Give 'em a pile of scrap and they'll cobble together anythin' you fancy. 'Course, just like the Gridanians, we've got fighters of our own. We might've come with a more constructive purpose in mind, but we're more'n capable of cracking skulls, believe you me.

**YSHTOLA:** Well, you're certainly raring to go. But then again, so are we. The most dependable warriors of Ul'dah and Ala Mhigo have assembled at the sultana and General Aldynn's behest. If Garlemald has truly fallen, then the whole place is likely to be crawling with Telophoroi. We'll need plenty of troops to clear and hold a path for others to follow. That's where we come in. Naturally, Marshal Tarupin and I will be leading from the front.

**LYSE:** It's been some time since I last saw you in your element on the battlefield.

**LUCIA:** From what I've heard, you've become pretty fearsome yourself. “Master Matoya,” the “avatar of destruction.” No subtitles. Report if displayed. With comrades like these, I know we'll succeed, no matter what awaits us. And then we might finally get a chance to enjoy a good long rest. But until then, let's give it our all!

**ALPHINAUD:** As for Ishgard, we Temple Knights have come in force to uphold our nation's commitment to the peace and welfare of our allies. The bitter cold of Garlemald is a formidable enemy in of itself. Our experience fighting in ice and snow will prove invaluable in the days ahead. Accordingly, I have been designated commander of the Ilsabard contingent. I will do all in my power to provide you with the leadership and guidance you require. The four High Houses─House Haillenarte foremost among them─have arranged for a host of machinists to join us on our mission. Their knowledge of imperial magitek is sure to be a great boon. They will address any problems of a technical nature, together with the smiths of Limsa Lominsa. There is another awaiting introduction...

**EMMANELLAIN:** Lord Emmanellain!

**000:** Ah, yes... Emmanellain de Fortemps, at your service. Though...lest there be any misunderstanding, I should stress that I've not become a “fearsome” warrior while you were away. Rather far from it, actually. My brother, in his infinite wisdom, decided this would be an excellent chance to make something of myself... Oh, and fight for world peace and all that. But should the opportunity arise for a spot of ballroom dancing, I will be your twinkle-toed Gentleman of Light!

**EMMANELLAIN:** What will you say? May your graceful prancing lead the way to victory! I daresay your fancy footwork may be all that stands between us and certain doom.

**LUCIA:** Huzzah! I cannot wait to regale Honoroit with my tales of derring-do!

**ALISAIE:** I believe that concludes introductions for the Grand Company of Eorzea. Our allies from the Eastern alliance were due to arrive some time ago, but it would appear they have been delayed...

**THANCRED:** Would that be the shinobi of Doma?

**SADU:** Actually, they've been tasked with relaying messages back and forth between the various Eastern nations. According to Lord Hien, however, an equally capable company of warriors has been sent in their stead...

**CIRINA:** (-???-)Out of my way, you preening fool!

**LYSE:** Forgive us for coming late! We are the delegates of the Eastern alliance.

**SADU:** Cirina! And you've brought company!

**CIRINA:** For battle and blood we come, as the Steppe is sorely lacking in both. No towers befoul our lands, so we marched on those of Doma─only to find them beyond our reach. But now our thirst for slaughter will be slaked. No quarter to the enemy!

**LUCIA:** Sadu Khatun, no! We go to make peace with the ironmen, not war.

**CIRINA:** Warriors of the Steppe, we have heard many tales of your bravery. We welcome you as allies. And these other ones you have brought are...?

**THANCRED:** Members of the Dalmascan resistance group, Lente's Tears.

**ALPHINAUD:** And the Bozjan Resistance. Between them, they have a wealth of experience in espionage, and are particularly adept at infiltrating imperial facilities. Which is fortuitous, since Garlemald's domain is so vast that I could never hope to handle reconnaissance duties all by myself.

**LYSE:** Dalmasca, Bozja, Ala Mhigo... All lands which have suffered the tyranny of the Empire. I would never presume to question your motives. Nevertheless, I must reiterate that our goal is to aid the victims of the Telophoroi. The commonfolk of Garlemald. And they are victims, make no mistake. Though I understand that many may struggle to see them as such...

**ALPHINAUD:** You're more right than you know. For every one of us that answered the call, there were a dozen that refused. Not only in Ala Mhigo, but everywhere we went. And who could blame them? The Empire's always been “the enemy.” But after seeing what we've seen...fighting and working against─and with─Garleans, there's no denying the simple truth. They're just people. No different from you or I. They've got their share of liars and murderers, but so do we. So do we all. Fordola, who once swore herself to Garlemald, has proven herself a trusted ally time and time again. Every Eorzean here knows Cid Garlond, the imperial defector who shared with us countless technological wonders. Gaius bloody Baelsar himself is working to help rebuild Werlyt, a nation he once conquered. Maxima, who stands with us today, tried to reform Garlemald from within and make peace with Doma. So you can believe me when I say that every fighter here understands and accepts that the imperials are not monsters and are deserving of help. Or at least that they were able to put aside their feelings for the greater good. It won't be easy, but we're all determined to make this world a better place.

**LUCIA:** What lingering concerns I may have had were clearly unwarranted. I agree with everything you said wholeheartedly.

**MAXIMA:** Then we are in accord. Now─let us review our strategy. To reach the Garlean capital in northern Ilsabard, we must cross the central mountain range. Fortunately, Garlond Ironworks can provide aerial transport, sparing us this most treacherous part of our journey. However, attempting to fly any closer to Garlemald would attract the attention of the Telophoroi. As they appear to have seized control of the majority of the imperial military, we must assume that includes its fleet. In addition, Garlemald possesses devices that can interfere with airship navigational systems, further discouraging an airborne approach.

**LUCIA:** Given the circumstances, the closest we dare deploy our contingent is an area between the range and the capital─the Magna Glacies. From there, we must travel the rest of the way on foot. We will also need to bring the airships with us to ensure we can withdraw with haste. Although much of the terrain will be blanketed in snow, we should be able to make use of local roads and shipping facilities. The vast ice field will afford us an unobstructed view of the surrounding area. On the other hand, it will also allow others to easily spot us, so it is imperative that we only make camp in positions where we can easily defend ourselves─and the airships, which must be kept safe at all costs.

**EMETSELCH:** We cannot account for every possibility, so we must be prepared to think on our feet. We will be tested. Sorely tested, I expect. But for our homes and for our people─and a people not our own but in need─we will succeed. Spare no effort in your preparations. Once we depart, there is no turning back.

**LUCIA:** Ilsabard...divided in twain by a vast mountain range. Those who would traverse its jagged peaks face peril at every step. But why go by foot when one can simply fly? On the outskirts of the imperial capital, in the frozen wastes of the Magna Glacies... The winds howl in icy protest, as if to warn against further trespass...

**ALISAIE:** We've received word from Thancred's reconnaissance party. They have sighted a detachment of heavily armed imperials.

**LUCIA:** Survivors of the civil war, perhaps?

**ALPHINAUD:** Perhaps. But there is more to it than that... Maxima reports that they are led by Vergilia, legatus of the IIIrd Legion, which comprises the bulk of their number. However, they are also joined by several members of the Ist.

**LUCIA:** From what I recall, the IIIrd Legion fought for Nerva in the war of succession following Varis's death. The Ist, on the other hand, were under the direct command of the Emperor, and rejected Nerva's claim to the throne. These legions were enemies.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. In fact, our sources claim that it was a conflict between them that sparked the civil war. Yet now these former foes cooperate to defend a ruined Garlemald from invasion...

**SICARD:** Then it is all but certain they have been tempered.

**LUCIA:** So what's the plan? If me and my crew was out reavin', we'd charge straight in, no messin' about. But that ain't what we're here for.

**ARUHNSENNA:** Quite right. Soldiers or no, they are people of Garlemald. The very ones we have come to aid. Direct confrontation is unavoidable. Nevertheless, we must make every effort to limit casualties on both sides. Rather than kill them, I would remove them from the field.

**URIANGER:** How so? Savage beatings, disarmament, and imprisonment? Not impossible, but easier said than done in the heat of battle.

**LUCIA:** Having observed the opposition, I imagine Thancred had something to suggest?

**ARUHNSENNA:** He did. He and the other scouts have already infiltrated a supply depot some distance beyond the imperial detachment's current position. Stored within is a stockpile of magitek armaments, and once we give the signal, Thancred's team will destroy them all. In so doing, we will deprive frontline troops of materiel, and likely force the detachment to send men to investigate.

**LUCIA:** Divide and conquer... Not a bad idea.

**SYSTEM:** Once the scouts have finished their preparations, we will split into two groups. The first will form the vanguard, while the other brings up the rear with our supplies. As for the Scions, I ask that you lend your assistance where you deem it needed most. I would prefer, however, that you accompany the rear guard, and be prepared to join the van at a moment's notice. Kept in reserve as our trump card, so to speak.

**MAXIMA:** Meanwhile, at the imperial supply depot...

**THANCRED:** Your proposal was well received. More specifically, they asked that we “destroy the imperials' toys in as spectacular a fashion as possible.”

**MAXIMA:** Y'shtola always did have a flair for the dramatic. She's not an easy woman to please, but I shall do my best to satisfy her thirst for fireworks. All right. Once more, for my peace of mind. Our first objective will be to rig the enemy's magitek with explosives. After we've withdrawn to a safe distance, we'll detonate them remotely. Our second will be to issue a deactivation command to the automated units via the control terminal. If our calculations are correct, this signal should reach those deployed on the front line, giving our friends a much-needed upper hand. The blizzard will help us stay hidden, so let's aim to get in and out before it passes. Trust in the plan, and we should all live to see tomorrow.

**THANCRED:** In the meantime, I will relay messages back and forth as the situation unfolds. You'll forgive me if I ask again, but...are you certain you wish to play the lone wolf?

**MAXIMA:** Wouldn't have it any other way. Call it foolish and reckless if you like, but I'll get the job done. I always do.

**THANCRED:** Very well. I wish you the best of luck.

**MAXIMA:** It's time. We only have one shot at this, so let's make it count!

**THANCRED:** You are returned─and none the worse for wear, to my considerable relief.

**MAXIMA:** What news from our comrades?

**THANCRED:** They stand at the ready.

**SYSTEM:** Excellent. Then let the fireworks begin!

**ALISAIE:** A few moments later, at the rear of the Ilsabard contingent's supply caravan...

**SICARD:** The blizzard's beginning to clear... The vanguard should be engaging the imperials any moment now─if they haven't already. Y'shtola and the others are with them, so I'm sure they'll be all right, but...   Wait! Something's coming!

**SYSTEM:** Oi, oi! Looks like we ain't the only ones who sent out scouts! Keep 'em away from the carriages! We lose those, and we're as good as dead!

**ESTINIEN:** Meanwhile, on the front line...

**YSHTOLA:**  

**ESTINIEN:** “Remove from the field” was not a euphemism for “enthusiastically murder.”

**YSHTOLA:** It's nothing that won't heal. In time. The trouble is, their tempering has made them utterly fearless. Subduing them would be easier if they had the capacity to submit in the first place.

**ESTINIEN:** Well, this is the path our young charges would have us walk─and that we all agreed to follow. You knew it would be hard, yet still you pledged your lance, did you not?

**MAGNAI:** That I did.

**LYSE:**  

**LUCIA:** That's Vergilia! Damn it, I need to help the others take her down─

**LYSE:** There's no end to them!

**SADU:** I was wondering when you'd turn up! There's no stopping us now! Come on, let's show them what we're made of!

**CIRINA:** Hah... A worthy adversary! Rest. Recover. Reclaim yourself. Then we will fight again─to the death.

**LUCIA:** Sadu Khatun!

**EMETSELCH:** That was the last of them... The day is ours, thanks to your timely arrival. What of the supply caravan? Hmm. Outmaneuvered, but not outmatched. Good. Let us take the imperials into custody and rejoin our comrades. And soon we shall arrive at the capital...

**MAXIMA:** “So cold and unforgiving.” Thus spoke Emperor Solus as he gazed upon his barren domain. Eight hundred years it had been since the Garleans first set foot here. Bested by the Corvosi after centuries of war and driven from fertile southern pastures into the blasted northern wastes. In that garden of desolation, they clung to one another for warmth. Freezing, hungry, desperate. Hated. The chosen forsaken. In the year 1513 of the Sixth Astral Era, a young legatus named Solus single-handedly sparked the magitek revolution. How did he conceive the machina that feed on ceruleum? Once a common, soft-spoken soldier─how had he so quickly ascended through the ranks? Like so many others, those who knew the truth are gone. Taking in the capital with his eyes for the first time, I recall thinking to myself... “Far colder on the earth than in the heavens.” Yes, far colder indeed...bitterly so.

**LUCIA:** Not so much as a whisper...

**MAXIMA:** The roads leading beyond the city walls would have been used less in recent years. Nevertheless, this was one of the most important gateways into the capital.

**LUCIA:** Abuzz day and night with activity, aye. Merchants passing through the checkpoint, many of them stopping at the local hostelries.

**ARUHNSENNA:** Surely, they cannot *all* have been tempered...

**LUCIA:** We can consider the question after we have made camp. If we spend any longer outside, we may well freeze to death where we stand. The tempered imperials, too.

**SICARD:** This will be our temporary base of operations. Secure shelter for ourselves and the injured, and dispatch scouts to survey the surrounding area.

**LUCIA:** If we're plannin' on stayin' here a while, we ought to give this place a proper name.

**YSHTOLA:** Hmm... The constant sound of ice cracking underfoot makes me think of broken glass. An apt name, perhaps. But enough of this. To work, everyone! Our present situation is as follows. Efforts to aid the people of Garlemald have begun in earnest. Moreover, having entered into the capital, the imperial palace is within our reach.

**MAXIMA:** But before we proceed further, we must learn what has befallen this city, for therein lies the key to understanding and combating the Telophoroi's designs.

**YSHTOLA:** I have a suggestion, if I may. Several of the imperial soldiers we captured on the Magna Glacies are members of the Populares and acquaintances of mine. Once we have cured them of their tempering, they should be able to give a reliable account of the events leading to the capital's downfall.

**ALISAIE:** A promising idea. I will assist the healers in their ministrations. Of course, I will require a porxie of my own, assuming you can spare one.

**YSHTOLA:** Would you like a hand?

**SICARD:** No, no, I am sure we will manage. Better that you take my place in the field. The noxious aether of this place disagrees with me, and as I shall need to draw on my own for the treatment, 'twould be prudent for me to remain within the camp.

**LUCIA:** This talk of curin' the tempered is all well and good, but I reckon the cold is a more pressin' concern. All the houses 'round here are fitted with ceruleum heaters that could keep us warm and toasty. Problem is, the machines seem to have given up the ghost─and if we keep sittin' around, freezin' our arses off, we'll be next. My smiths reckon that with the right parts, they can have 'em workin' again, but it won't be easy.

**THANCRED:** Understood. The machinists will assist them in the repairs.

**LUCIA:** The rest of us should either stand watch or survey the area.

**ESTINIEN:** We have made our presence known to the Telophoroi. They will be searching for us─if they have not already ascertained our position. That we have seen no sign of them since the battle suggests they have yet to do so. However, I suspect they may be biding their time...

**THANCRED:** ...Or perhaps we are beneath their notice.

**LYSE:** In any event, we'll find no answers standing around here. Urianger, Estinien, and myself have visited Garlemald recently, so we'll lead the reconnaissance efforts. Perhaps bolstered by a few Bozjan and Dalmascan scouts from my previous excursion for good measure.

**THANCRED:** Don't forget about us Ala Mhigans. We have experienced scouts of our own.

**GRAHATIA:** Well now, this is turning out to be a rather sizable team. With such numbers we should be able to cover a wide area with relative ease, including that surrounding the imperial palace. How about you, G'raha? I've a feeling we'll find a use or two for that vanishing spell of yours.

**ALISAIE:** 'Twould be my honor to be of service, though I doubt that you of all people need rely on my tricks.

**LUCIA:** That leaves us with guard duty...

**000:** As a matter of fact, I have something else in mind for the two of you and Alphinaud. Between here and the center of the capital lies the Eblan Rime. I would have you search the area for survivors. Your keen sense of direction honed in your extensive travels should prove useful in navigating the ice fields.

**LUCIA:** What will you say? If there are any survivors, we will surely find them. “Extensive travels” is something of an understatement, but I suppose if there's nothing else that needs doing... Ice fields! I love ice fields! ...Oh wait, no I don't.

**ALISAIE:** I have faith that you will, and look forward to greeting you on your safe return. This too is a vital task, and I appreciate your willingness to see it done. Rest assured that a serving of hot soup will be waiting for you. Hmm. As ever, you do not want for enthusiasm. But given your experience traipsing about through Coerthas, I should be surprised if you let a little inclement weather dampen your redoubtable spirits. And even if that were the case, the promise of hot soup upon your return would surely spur you to action. You all have your duties. Let us make haste. May the Fury bless and keep you.

**ALPHINAUD:**  

**ALISAIE:**  

**ALPHINAUD:** Blood trail... We found one. They were attacked... No...   Why...why wouldn't they...

**ALISAIE:** Safer to brave the wilds than trust in our magic. We should've... I should've... We can't leave them like this. We have to take them home.

**ALPHINAUD:** What if we're only making it worse?

**LUCIA:** Maybe we don't belong here. But neither do they. Not out here in the wind and the cold. I heard the story. About Varis's voice. From beyond the grave... Of course, I didn't believe it. But Licinia and her sister did. Perhaps there is something to the tale after all. I want to understand. So I'm going to borrow this for a while. If that's all right. You had every reason not to trust us. We came as trespassers. Invaders. But I pray that, in time, we will be more than that to you. That we will find a way to help your loved ones...and see that no more children are left to freeze alone in the snow.

**MAXIMA:** Thank you for your report. We shall inform the troops of these developments, and instruct them to proceed with the utmost caution should they encounter any survivors.

**ALPHINAUD:** Allow me to go and speak with the ones at the Victors' Spoils. They may be more willing to listen to a fellow Garlean and accept our offer of assistance.

**LUCIA:** I pray you are right. And though I am loath to burden you any further, should there be an appropriate occasion to speak of Licinia and her sister...please do so.

**ALISAIE:** I am sorry to have put you through this.

**YSHTOLA:** My distress is nothing compared to their suffering... So tell me: what else have we learned?

**ARUHNSENNA:** As you may have already heard, we have succeeded in curing the members of the Populares Maxima identified. They have provided us with some intriguing insights into the current state of Garlemald. The assassination of Emperor Varis was the catalyst for the civil war. Nerva declared his claim to the throne, and his opponents refused to recognize it. Fighting broke out in the capital, where Nerva's IIIrd Legion clashed with the Ist, who remained loyal to Varis even after his death.

**LUCIA:** Of course, even imperial warmongers would balk at the idea of turning their shining city into a battleground. Like burning down the wood to spite the wasps. Neither side would be so mad. Unless something or *someone* inflamed their animosity to such an extent that they could not help but act against their better judgment.

**ALISAIE:** It brings to mind events at the Ghimlyt Dark, does it not? The Emperor's sudden withdrawal from the front lines, specifically. Nerva and his father, Titus─Varis's then political rival─took advantage of rumors that Crown Prince Zenos had been possessed by a demon.

**LUCIA:** Elidibus. What better way to disparage your enemies than with the truth─or a close enough approximation.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed. But before their accusations could be substantiated, many of Titus's followers were silenced. While some were merely stripped of their status, others died under curious circumstances. One after another, suddenly and suspiciously.

**ALPHINAUD:** Again, Elidibus. Like as not, he had a hand in it. No evidence was found to implicate Varis, certainly. Nevertheless, Titus, Nerva, and the IIIrd Legion would have judged it a brazen attempt by the Emperor to rid himself of his political enemies. And then, in the midst of this growing turmoil, Varis zos Galvus is murdered... And Garlemald's own prodigal son, Gaius van Baelsar, is named the murderer. Shortly thereafter, Nerva claims the right of succession, and in response, the Ist Legion claims the assassination was part of a coup d'état orchestrated by Titus and Nerva.

**MAXIMA:** So no one is at fault and everyone else is to blame.

**ALISAIE:** I should add that both parties received substantial financial backing─presumably to provide them with the means and encouragement to pursue a swift victory─and that these contributions came from the selfsame benefactor.

**MAXIMA:** I'd heard House Brutus had been filling the IIIrd Legion's coffers, but the Ist as well?

**ALPHINAUD:** It would seem so. Though the Populares determined that the Ist Legion received funds from a variety of organizations, all had connections to House Brutus.

**MAXIMA:** So Fandaniel, in the guise of Asahi, was playing both sides against each other the entire time!

**ALISAIE:** The information we gained from my friends does not end there. One night shortly after fighting broke out, the capital was shaken by an immense tremor. From that point onward, they have no memories─no recollection of any events, including our clash on the Magna Glacies. But when asked about the imperial palace and its bizarre transformation, they somehow recall Emperor Varis giving them orders. In their dreams. “May the Tower of Babil stand as testament to the glory of Garlemald!”

**ALPHINAUD:** This sounds awfully familiar...

**MAXIMA:** We have something to show you all.

**YSHTOLA:** Varis spoke to them through this radio...? Perhaps it was a recording, but if not, that would be...inexplicable.

**ARUHNSENNA:** We are of one mind, then.

**YSHTOLA:** The aether that permeates the ore used in this device is almost identical to that of the talismans.

**ALPHINAUD:** I see it... While it is likely more by coincidence than design, these devices might also ward against a primal's influence. A picture is beginning to form. If the tremor felt throughout Garlemald was a wave of aether emitted by a primal... ...Then while those within range would have been tempered, those huddled around a radio─desperate for news concerning the civil war─would have been spared.

**CIRINA:** No wonder Licinia kept it close...

**ALPHINAUD:** My friends! I must speak with you! A young man was caught trying to steal our supplies. He is a soldier of the ironmen, we think, but one who has not been made thrall. Thankfully, Magnai restrained him before blood was spilled. The stranger is outside, if you wish to ask him questions.

**LUCIA:** I think we do.

**JULLUS:** Who do we have here?

**LUCIA:** (-???-)Garleans!? (-???-)Traitors to your homeland! Have you no shame!?

**JULLUS:** I am Lucia Junius, a Temple Knight of Ishgard. And you are?

**LUCIA:** Jullus pyr Norbanus. And that's all you invaders will get from me.

**JULLUS:** We are not here to invade Garlemald. Far from it. Like you, our allies in Eorzea and the Far East fight in defense of their lives and their loved ones, even as we speak. But it is the people of Garlemald who have suffered most. This we know. And that is why we have come to offer you our aid, that we may unite against our common foe. Whether you believe me or not, those are the facts. Now, answer me this. Why would a proud soldier of the Empire be reduced to stealing? The situation must be dire indeed for you to go to such lengths.

**LUCIA:**  Report if displayed.

**JULLUS:** If it is supplies you seek, we would gladly share ours. Or turn a blind eye while you leave with your “spoils.”

**YSHTOLA:** I will not negotiate. My commander will determine how to deal with you and yours. If you wish to treat with him, I will take you. But no more than three.

**ALPHINAUD:** I don't much like the sound of that, but if we do accept his proposal, I suggest the two of us and...

**YSHTOLA:** Please allow me and Alisaie to act as envoys.

**ALPHINAUD:** May I ask why?

**ALISAIE:** We have seen with our own eyes the hardships the Garleans face. How their futures and lives hang in the balance.

**000:** It's not the warmest invitation, but it's an opportunity to prove our intentions true. Maybe not a chance to make things right, but a chance to...make them better.

**LUCIA:** What will you say? I'm going with you. What would your mother say if I let you two go by yourselves?

**JULLUS:** I can see that persuading you otherwise is a lost cause. But you will proceed with the utmost care.

**LUCIA:** A couple of children and what─a sellsword? Is this an insult?

**JULLUS:** Not in the least. You will find that they are more than qualified to speak on our behalf.

**QUINTUS:** There are many dangers on the road ahead. I will need that back. ...These are their chosen representatives.

**JULLUS:** (-Imposing Commander-)Very well. Let us hear what they have to say.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes sir! I present to you our commander... ...Lord Quintus van Cinna, legatus of the Ist Legion.

**QUINTUS:** The Ist? I had no idea you had survived!

**ALPHINAUD:** We lost our Emperor, our city, more than half our troops. For my wounds, I may never take the field again. But we survived, aye. In a manner much to your liking, I daresay.

**QUINTUS:** We have no intention of adding to your misfortunes. Nor do we bear you any ill will.

**ALPHINAUD:** Spare me. Though you children may speak in earnest, overtures of peace ever ring hollow in my ears. So long as man stands to profit from his neighbor's suffering, war is inevitable. Driven from our ancestral homeland into this blasted waste. Yet still you yearned to rob us of our paltry scraps. 'Twas only with magitek that you learned to keep your distance. Though we knew it was only a matter of time before you regrouped and returned. Conquest and empire were our only defenses. Emperors Solus and Varis understood this, and through their campaigns saw us grow and prosper. Much blood has been spilled in Garlemald's name, aye, but if it is a choice between yours and mine, then it is hardly a choice at all.

**QUINTUS:** I do not deny that a great many conflicts throughout history were driven by the desire─or necessity─to gain by another's loss. That is not why we are here. Nor have we come to petition your aid in the war with the Telophoroi, grave though that threat may be. Our purpose is simply this: We wish to help you. Let us help you. If there is aught that can be done to ease your plight, we would be glad to do it.

**ALISAIE:** Perhaps you would. But regardless of the ideals you espouse, your leaders would not send an army into Garlemald if they did not stand to benefit. If we accept their aid, they will expect their efforts to be rewarded once the Telophoroi are no longer a threat. And after compensation and concessions, the great Empire would be brought to heel. Her enemies rejoice at her downfall. Our third eye a mark of shame.

**ALPHINAUD:** We won't stand idly by and let your people be humiliated─and we're not alone in that. We only want to make a difference─to make this world of ours better. Surely you can understand that. What I'm trying to say is...there are so, so many people who just don't care about making you suffer. And maybe that's almost insulting after all the suffering you feel the world has subjected your people to, but... Believe it or not, that's the truth. And now we're here, and all we're asking is for you to tell us what you want. What you hope for.

**QUINTUS:** So much blood has been shed. So much lost. All because of this endless war. Who wouldn't want to end it? Can we not work together, to face our problems as one?

**ALPHINAUD:** Answer me this, young peacemakers. If a world without conflict is your desire, why reject the unity and prosperity of Garlemald? Is it because we do not share your faith? That we do not share your heritage? That our ideals and virtues differ? That we cherish and hold in the highest that which you do not? Disparity is the root of discord, and peace built on compromise is flawed and fleeting. Happiness for one and all is a dream, and the reality is that to the victor go the spoils. That is why we Garleans will never submit nor surrender. For freedom and for pride, we will remain true to ourselves until the bitter end. That is my hope. It seems there is nothing more to say on the matter. You will remain here while I decide what is to be done with you. Do not be alarmed. No harm will come to you─if you cooperate.

**QUINTUS:** We will not resist. However, as your “guests,” I ask that we be allowed to speak with the other members of your group.

**ALPHINAUD:** As you wish. I had no intention of locking you up, as by dawn you would be frozen stiff, and you are no good to me dead. You are free to move about the encampment. But there is one condition. Collar them.

**QUINTUS:** What are these...?

**ALPHINAUD:** Incentive. You will be watched at all times. Stray too far or act suspiciously and we will administer a rather painful shock. Stop. Keep away from that one. The champion of Eorzea is not so easily cowed. Even if she allowed herself to be collared, the shock would be no more than an itch. No─if she refuses to obey, we will activate the twins' restraints instead.

**ALISAIE:** You needn't worry about us.

**QUINTUS:** We'll forget we're even wearing them soon enough.

**000:** Even now, you still... Why go to such lengths? What is it all for?

**QUINTUS:** What will you say? Because even the most bitter adversary may one day see reason. On the coldest, blackest of nights...meager though it may be, we must share the warmth of our fire.

**JULLUS:** You are a curious one. A far cry from the merciless barbarian others paint you to be. You will be their warden. Take them away.

**THANCRED:** Yes sir!

**JULLUS:** Finally escaped the watchful gaze of your keepers, have we? Don't react. You'll only draw attention to yourself. Just carry on as you are and listen. After you left with the Garlean lad, Lucia bade a few of us scouts follow you at a discreet distance. We observed you being led into the station, but decided against venturing inside. When you emerged some time later, and we saw that the twins were sporting magitek collars, it was clear what had taken place. Now, as quietly as you can, tell me everything. The legatus himself, eh? Now there's a surprise. This is also the first I've heard of a plan to join forces with the Xth and storm the Tower of Babil. An interesting development...and perhaps the opportunity we've been waiting for. Our comrades back at the camp also received some rather promising news, but it's still too early to get our hopes up. For now, keeping yourselves out of harm's way comes before all else. Whatever demands the Garleans make, indulge them. With luck, this will all be over soon. Until then.

**ALISAIE:** They had not gone far.

**JULLUS:** We searched high and low, but no luck, I'm afraid. I might've guessed you'd be the only one to find anything.

**COLLEAGUESOLDIER:** I wasn't expecting much to begin with. Eventually, there will be nothing left out here for us to safely salvage. For now, this will have to suffice. We should return to the station.

**JULLUS:** Ah, there you are. Heard you'd gone hunting for ceruleum above ground. Brought back a king's ransom?

**COLLEAGUESOLDIER:** Hardly. But thanks to these three, we have enough to last a little while longer.

**QUINTUS:** Well, well. It's not at all what I was expecting, these ones. For savages, they seem positively docile. Ah, it's a poor attempt at humor. In all honesty, I'm grateful for your efforts. But even with another night of warmth, there are those among us who may not live to see the morrow...

**JULLUS:** I trust your expedition was fruitful.

**QUINTUS:** Lord Quintus!

**JULLUS:** Use what you procured to refuel the armor.

**QUINTUS:** But sir, what about the heaters for the camp?

**ALISAIE:** The time for action is upon us. My men and I have matters to discuss. In the meantime, you are to wait here. Do not forget─you are being watched.

**ALPHINAUD:** “The time for action”... What did he mean by that?

**ALISAIE:** I can only speculate. Clearly something requiring their magitek, given what we just heard. Whether they plan to utilize it now or after they join with the Xth is another question... Will they ever escape this cold? Return to and reclaim the idyllic spaces of which Jullus spoke...?

**JULLUS:** Finished your war council?

**ALISAIE:** Alphinaud and Alisaie are to stay here...as our prisoners. They will be released once your comrades have relinquished their supplies and withdrawn from Garlean soil. Until our terms are met, they will be detained at a separate location.

**ALPHINAUD:** After everything we've said and done, this is how you treat us!?

**THANCRED:** Our allies have but limited supplies. They may stave off cold and starvation for a short while, but what then!?

**000:** For now, keeping yourselves out of harm's way comes before all else. Whatever demands the Garleans make, indulge them.

**JULLUS:** What will you say? Do as he says. Everything will be all right. Have faith.

**ALISAIE:** Get them out of here. This is my home. *Our* home. Least it was until that night. I was with Lord Quintus when the capital fell, and thus spared. My family, who did not own a radio, were less fortunate. When dawn came, I made my way here. My parents...my little brother and sister...they were still inside... But they weren't themselves, and they...they tried to... And I had to... I'd promised to take them away from the capital that very morning. To somewhere safe, to hide until the fighting stopped. I promised... The Garlean flag bears a chain. The bonds between our countrymen. A red link at its center─the blood of the fallen. Our loved ones who lived and died for Garlemald. But if she, too, fell, who would be left to remember them and their sacrifice? What enduring proof would there be that they were ever here? If we had turned to your gods, would they have saved us? I'm sorry. Forget I spoke. We should go.

**ALPHINAUD:** It's no use.

**ALISAIE:** Believe me, I do not enjoy being here any more than you. But he wanted us to play along, so that is what we will do. Believe me, I do not enjoy being here any more than you. But she wanted us to play along, so that is what we will do.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...It's so cold.

**ALISAIE:** Painfully so... Unbearably.

**ALPHINAUD:** I've been thinking about what Quintus said. About why no one would accept Garlean rule. Irreconcilable differences. When coexistence isn't an option, only conquest remains. Varis at Ghimlyt said much the same. Only by uniting the world beneath a single standard would we rid ourselves of the Ascians. United...as one people. One race, cleansed of “imperfections.” A cold and unforgiving vision. And when we fail to live up to their standards...what place is there for us in their world? But the truly sad, truly *frustrating* thing is how damnably similar it all is to the lofty ideals of Father and the Forum. Nonintervention─always nonintervention. Protect our knowledge and our people and to hells with the rest of you. And yet...I can see how it happened. Varis and Father looked to their elders for guidance and took their virtues as their own. For this world was of their making─in who else could they place their trust? All of us lost in a sea of chaos, searching desperately for purpose and meaning...but it shouldn't just be an extension of another's. It has to be ours. It has to be. We all have a stake in this world. No one should be silenced...

**ALISAIE:** I won't deny that we lack the experience of people such as Father or Quintus. Perhaps they've come to see the world as a series of problems, and the most efficient way of solving them to reduce everything to fundamental forms. A stone is a stone, a cloud a cloud, a flower no more than that. Simple descriptions that strip the subject of distinguishing characteristics. A man is a man. Divided according to race, creed, or allegiance─and to some, defined by such associations.

**ALPHINAUD:** Is that what *you* think?

**LUCIA:** In my misbegotten youth. But what I believed wisdom was no more than aggressive ignorance. I've since learned to look beyond the banners and the politics. To see people as individuals with their own hopes and dreams. As for my dream of building a better world... Well, every day I am reminded that it is far more complex than I had ever imagined. But it only spurs me onward. To find the wisdom and the strength to see it through to the very end.

**JULLUS:** All of our supplies and an immediate withdrawal? These are your conditions?

**ALISAIE:** Demands. And you forgot about the airship. Once again, you will leave one behind. It will be used to return the prisoners. Their collars will be removed prior to the exchange.

**ALPHINAUD:** So in the end, not even Father's expertly worded rhetoric could deter you from your chosen course.

**ALISAIE:** Huh?

**ALPHINAUD:** Not that I thought for a moment that it would. I've no love for violence, of course, but ours is a cause worth fighting for. I just wish he'd realize it too. Sometimes the only way to protect the ones you love is to take a stand. To refuse to suffer in silence. I want you to know I share your conviction. Whether it be on the battlefield or in the debating chamber, I won't back down. I guess what I'm saying is...

**ALISAIE:** You've found your own reason to fight.

**ALPHINAUD:** Yes. Yes, I have. Gods willing, there will come a day when we can finally lay down our arms, and there will be peace. But not until the Telophoroi have been defeated once and for all. And you, Brother, will have a vital part to play. By your words and deeds, you'll lead the way.

**ALISAIE:** ...I pray I am up to the task.

**ALPHINAUD:** There'll always be naysayers. Those who think us fools for even trying. It's easy for learned elites to criticize earnest efforts and assert their moral superiority. All without offering alternatives. Not that their sophistry has ever wounded you. So stubborn and strong─stronger than you even know. Don't ever change, you hear me? If you stumble, I'll be there to catch you. Or give you a thick ear. Maybe both for good measure.

**MAXIMA:** Thank you, Alisaie...

**LUCIA:** The scouts have secured Alisaie and Alphinaud. Their collars were removed without complication as well. They report no casualties─not for their party nor the guards, who will wake from their premature slumber in due course.

**JULLUS:** It would appear the situation has changed. I propose new terms. We have information that will be of great interest to Lord Quintus, and I wish to speak with him in person.

**LUCIA:** No. In the event you rejected our first proposal, we came prepared with a second.

**CIRINA:** Ambush!

**JULLUS:** More are coming! Make ready!

**LUCIA:** We, the loyal soldiers of the Ist Legion, proud servants of Garlemald... Of the fallen Emperor Varis, shall safeguard these lands... ...from the barbarian hordes until our countrymen return!

**ARUHNSENNA:**  Report if displayed.

**JULLUS:** Stop, both of you!

**ARUHNSENNA:**  Report if displayed

**LUCIA:** This child may be the worst emissary I have ever seen...

**JULLUS:** We received an urgent communication from the Grand Company of Eorzea. Envoys from the imperial army, led by members of the Xth Legion, came to Ala Mhigo and requested an audience. They explained that their efforts to coordinate the reclamation of the capital with the aid of the IVth, Vth, VIIIth, and XIIth had ended in failure. Communication between most legions has broken down entirely. Most of the Xth's conscripts have deserted, leaving their forces severely depleted. That is why, unable to continue the fight on their own, they and their allies turned to the Grand Company of Eorzea for aid.

**LUCIA:** Lies! Every word!

**JULLUS:** It is the truth, and I have not finished. The Xth has requested that we deliver a message to Lord Quintus. “Have the iyl stand down.”

**QUINTUS:** You have been listening, my lord? Wh-What are your orders?

**ALISAIE:**  Report if displayed. Inform her...that we will honor the Xth's decision. Bereft of hope...and now dignity. I release you from your duty. All of you. I take solace, Your Radiance, in the knowledge you are not here to witness our debasement. 'Twas a grand, glorious dream we shared. Of a world united. Of peace and prosperity. We are ghosts, you and I. Memories of days gone by. Bonds forged in blood...that I will not see tarnished.

**ALPHINAUD:** Quickly! We have to reach the station before it's too late!

**ALISAIE:** If there is still a chance that Quintus will agree to a truce, we must take it.

**ALPHINAUD:** I just hope we get there before he and his men do something rash... Is that all of them?

**THANCRED:** The last of those who agreed to join us, yes.

**ALISAIE:** We left heaters and provisions for those who wished to stay behind. They won't last forever, but hopefully they'll last long enough.

**JULLUS:** For now, I think everyone's earned a rest. We'll see to those in need of medical attention, so take the others with you and get yourselves some hot soup.

**EMMANELLAIN:** Warmth, at last...

**SICARD:** Marvelous, isn't it? All thanks to the resourceful machinists of Ishgard, I might add. On their behalf, I bid you warm yourself to your heart's content!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Hold on. Your people might've scribbled a few things on a piece of parchment, but it was our Lominsan smiths that put the bloody things together.

**SICARD:** Well, be that as it may...we single-handedly got the interior heating up and running again, didn't we?

**EMMANELLAIN:** The hells you did! We were there every step of the way!

**SICARD:** “We”!? You barely raised a finger to help, you ale-sodden reprobate!

**EMMANELLAIN:** I did a damn sight more than you, you lily-livered bilge rat!

**SICARD:** Take that back!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Make me!

**ALAMHIGANDELEGATION:** I will not stoop to your level!

**ULDAHNDELEGATION:** Here. At ease, man. There's nothing funny in it. I'm from Ala Mhigo, but was a conscript until recently. Used to eat this with the officers.

**GRIDANIANDELEGATION:** Apparently, it's adapted from a Steppe recipe. This is my first time trying it, and I have to say it's not half bad.

**ULDAHNDELEGATION:** Hmm... It's a bit too flavorful for my liking...

**ALAMHIGANDELEGATION:** Perhaps compared to what you're used to.

**JULLUS:** It's the little things that make life worth living, don't you think?

**LUCIA:**  Report if displayed.

**000:** I know this is not a dream, and yet... I felt the same way at the Dragonsong War's end. Every morning I would step outside and need to be reminded that it wasn't my imagination. That my world had been forever changed. And just as I had grown accustomed to the idea, again you change my world in ways I never thought possible. Were it not for you and your fellow Scions, the rifts between man and dragon and myriad tribes might never have been bridged. The Grand Company of Eorzea, the Ilsabard contingent... We owe it all to you. We've shed many tears in recent days. Of pain and sorrow. Triumph and joy. I much prefer the latter.

**LUCIA:** What will you say? As do I. We often don't have the luxury of choice.

**MAXIMA:** I am honored to fight by your side. As an Eorzean and Garlean both, I shall do all in my power to bring my peoples together. Indeed. We can but do our utmost to unite these disparate peoples and lead them to victory.

**LUCIA:** It is a remarkable achievement─everything that I and the Populares had hoped for and more.

**MAXIMA:** Would that it had come sooner.

**LUCIA:** Indeed. Too many are not here to see it. And yet...there is a warmth in my breast. As if they still share in this moment.

**VARIS:** Yes. I know what you mean. On a night like tonight, the wind and cold seem to pass me by.

**JULLUS:** (-Radio-)We...have gained the power...take back...rightfully ours.

**URIANGER:** What? Emperor Varis?  Report if displayed.

**JULLUS:** They are being tempered! The talismans─quickly!

**FANDANIEL:**  Report if displayed.

**AMON:** (-???-)Save me, brave hero!

**000:** Ahem! My lord has requested your presence, and I would hate to disappoint him... The experiment was a success, but I fear our time is short. I shall begin the preparations. Now...it is time for you to awaken. Good morrow to you. Here─have a taste before it gets cold. Oh, but be sure to remove your helmet. Take a moment, too, to familiarize yourself with that borrowed flesh. So? How does it feel? I, for one, find those first moments within a new body to be most refreshing! We had a magitek engineer by the name of Aulus to thank for this method of soul extraction and implantation. I believe the two of you met briefly in Ala Mhigo? His was a rather sticky end, wasn't it? Thankfully, he was thoughtful enough to leave behind his mindjack technology. I took the liberty of making some improvements─and selecting you as my esteemed test subject.

**AMON:** What will you say? Give me back my body! This is *such* a pain in the arse.

**ZENOS:** And permit you to go on a righteous rampage instead of partaking in this delicious meal? I think not. Come now, to us Ascians, it is no different from trying on new clothes. Why not make the most of it by partaking in this fine cuisine? I must say, I have gone to great lengths to reunite you with my lord. When I discovered that his “friend” was in this neck of the woods, I suggested inviting you over for dinner. He never deigned to respond, but I took his silence as a resounding yes! Oh my! Daddy is pleased his grumpy little boy has finally found his playmate! Ah. Exposition is in order. The Garlean Empire has long outlawed all forms of religion. No gods to worship, no risk of summoning. Brilliantly simple. But people, being people, must turn to something or someone in their hour of need. Who, then? Why, His Radiance the Emperor, of course. As you have observed firsthand, Garlemald has seen better days. The legendary Solus zos Galvus─dead. Provinces near and far─in open rebellion. Our bold new Emperor─assassinated! And that last one even sparked a civil war! What rotten luck. The people cried out for salvation, their earnest pleas─one might even call them prayers─a supplication united for the Empire to reclaim her former glory. And so their will did manifest, channeled through the corpse of none other than Emperor Varis himself! And lo, the savior was born! The embodiment of the Garlean spirit, their Anima! It calls to its subjects, compelling them to take up arms and fight. And just as the wealth and power gravitate towards the Empire's capital, so too does aether, from every corner of the globe! The towers with which you and your allies have been so preoccupied were created as an extension of Anima itself. An ingenious design... Would you not agree, my lord?

**AMON:** Does the pursuit of prey you have bested before excite you? Of course not. Absent the challenge, the thrill, your prize is a hollow victory. Butchery. Perhaps you think that to be the extent of my promise. I have no doubt fallen in your estimation since Ala Mhigo. Fair enough. But do not let your disdain deprive you─deprive us─of an opportunity to craft an even more majestic moment of euphoria. I have been honing my craft as I set the stage for our reunion. Wheresoever there is suffering and despair, you appear, to fulfill your duty as defender of this star. The chaos and destruction that my hordes have wrought...are my gifts to you alone. At a loss for words? No matter. As you will learn, I have only just begun.

**ZENOS:** Oh? Will you not finish your meal?

**AMON:** There is only one thing that can sate my hunger, and it would seem my friend has lost her appetite. I hoped this display of civility might prove an entertaining diversion, but clearly we are above such pretensions. While my lifeless body was in the possession of the Ascian, I too claimed another's as my own. It was an enlightening experience, to fight in an unfamiliar form. Flaws and failings in my technique were plain to see. Whence rises one's true strength? The flesh? The soul? Perhaps you should like to discover the answer for yourself. Or...together.

**YSHTOLA:** Oh dear! Whatever would happen if my lord were to greet your friends as you? I shudder to imagine what carnage he would wreak! We'd better hurry if we want to avert the bloodbath. You can thank me later for my generosity. Ah, there it is. Your camp, I believe. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that you─the other you─is making her way there as we speak. Alas, this you will have to walk from here. Or run, if you can manage it. My lord would be cross if I made it too easy. Such ingratitude. I'd not squander this fighting chance. After all, you've obstacles enough to overcome─right on cue! Tempered soldiers, with standing orders to kill those not sworn to Anima. Under normal circumstances you would make short work of them. But on this occasion, the odds are not so heavily stacked in your favor.

**LUCIA:** It is a miracle we were able to restrain the tempered without suffering casualties.

**ALPHINAUD:** A welcome one. A-Ruhn-Senna and the others have their hands full as it is. Thankfully, there are enough scales for everyone.

**LUCIA:** And what of Jullus? His symptoms were particularly severe.

**ESTINIEN:** They were, but others fared still worse, including some brought back from the Magna Glacies. As those in most desperate need take priority, it may be a while before he receives treatment. But rest assured that he will. In the meantime, we must find our missing friend. May the Fury guide you.

**THANCRED:** Of all the bloody times for a disappearing act...

**ALPHINAUD:** Right when the first wave struck. We'd be fools to think it a coincidence. But where even to begin the search? No one saw her leave in the chaos, and we've no trail to follow.

**GRAHATIA:** While I know full well she can handle herself, I worry all the same.

**ALISAIE:** Ah. Speak of the devil...

**THANCRED:** Well! Time to call off the search!

**YSHTOLA:** Hmph. Case closed.

**URIANGER:** That's her? Over there?

**YSHTOLA:** Aye, 'twould appear so. Thou art struggling to perceive her presence?

**ALISAIE:** I am. Perhaps, in the aftermath of the wave, there is some residual effect interfering with my faculties, but...

**GRAHATIA:** Where have you been? We've been worried sick!

**ALISAIE:** Now, now, all's well that ends well. Are you all right?

**GRAHATIA:** *Are* you all right?

**000:** ...Who are you?

**AMON:** What will you say? Enough, Zenos! Get away from them, you bastard!

**ZENOS:** Sadly, that is all we have time for today. The effect has run its course, and back to your own bodies you must go. But where are my manners? You have all traveled so very far, and I have yet to pay my respects. Though in my defense, I was ill prepared to receive so many uninvited guests. As such, preliminary entertainments were in order. A handful of tempered soldiers to hamper your progress. Refugees to command your attention while I siphoned their ceruleum from the shadows─particularly effective, that. Charitable souls that you are, you bent over backwards to aid them, heedless of the delay. Predictable to a fault! And so my plan approaches completion unhindered. Anima will soon have absorbed the requisite amount of aether, and then shall come the spectacle to end all spectacles! The eldest and most powerful of primals will awaken, and all shall bear witness to the Final Days!

**VRITRA:** The gods themselves will be my meal. Your dear companions my dessert. Upon this world I'll feast, and death shall follow in my wake. All your hate, all your rage, you will render unto me.

**ALPHINAUD:** For upon thy life's reel wind too many threads. Of fate. Power. Weal, enmeshed with woe. More terrible still is the attrition wrought upon thy companions, as they are swept up in the storm of thine existence. Take heart and protect them well. They will be your strength and your salvation.

**000:** Thank goodness. She's awake!

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? Is everyone all right? So I'm not dead yet?

**ALISAIE:** Perfectly fine, yes. I hope the same can be said of you. I am pleased to report you are very much alive.

**YSHTOLA:** Everything in working order? That's a relief. Oh, and before I forget: thanks for coming to our rescue.

**LYSE:** Given recent events, I would be surprised if you weren't feeling a bit poorly. A hearty meal and a long rest would be my recommendation under normal circumstances, but these are anything but. If Fandaniel's boasts are to be believed, we must act quickly. Once you've blown away the cobwebs, we can discuss preparations for our assault on the Tower of Babil.

**ALPHINAUD:** Now or never!

**ALISAIE:** Farewell, Varis. May the gods have mercy on your soul. Come. The other two await.

**AMON:** This madness ends here!

**ESTINIEN:** Oh hush. This is the best part...

**AMON:** Enough!  Report if displayed

**URIANGER:**  Report if displayed. O mighty Zodiark, awaken from your slumber and descend!

**ALPHINAUD:** Some manner of magical defense!?

**HYDAELYN:** Krile! But how!?

**AMON:** (-Hydaelyn-)The shackles that bind my adversary will not be so easily broken!

**ZENOS:** Hydaelyn... Feeble relic of a forgotten age... Hark! Victory...is mine! No more aether... And I was so close! My lord, a slight change of plans. We shall travel to the moon and break this wretched barrier ourselves!

**GRAHATIA:** Whatever it takes.

**ZENOS:** What was that!?

**ALISAIE:** The final order issued by Anima to the tempered thralls. “Should the Empire fall, the world must share her fate.” Of course, Father lacked the conviction to give such a command. The abomination born of his flesh was but a puppet─and I the puppeteer.

**AMON:** You madman! You monster!

**HYDAELYN:** There's a funny joy in watching your flailing attempts to fight the inevitable. You're all going to die and are powerless to prevent it. We really must be on our way. You're welcome to give chase, provided you are content to leave comrade and tempered alike to die screaming.

**THANCRED:** (-Hydaelyn-)I have asked too much of this child. Tend to her. (-Hydaelyn-)The last brand at Mare Lamentorum is yet unbroken. Zodiark remains bound. (-Hydaelyn-)I have shifted the flow of aether and sent the enemy far from their destination. (-Hydaelyn-)Now, I shall divert it once more. An ally awaits, and I will deliver you unto him. (-Hydaelyn-)Seek his aid. Restore the seal. Zodiark must not be set free...

**ALISAIE:** The tempered are running wild. Not only those at the tower, but those back at the camp. The others are doing their best to contain them, but the situation is growing beyond our control.

**000:** Leave them to die, or give up the chase. Just like Fandaniel said...

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? I'm the one Zenos wants. Only I can bring an end to this. Garlemald's fate is in your hands.

**THANCRED:** You're...you're going alone!? You have our trust and our faith. I pray we have yours. Our friends and the tempered need our help. We will save as many as we can─I swear!

**EMETSELCH:** Once we have matters well in hand, we will join you on the moon. Until then, be careful. There's no telling what you'll find.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Long, long before Dalamud was forged to imprison an elder primal... The eldest of them all─savior of the star─was sealed within a moon of His own. Souls sacrificed to grant Him life still slumber and dream of the day He and we will be made whole. Here He waits, in this cold, barren place. His cradle and His grave. Silent lamentations and prayers of hope echo soundlessly to a sundered star, adrift and alone.

**000:** (-Distant Echo-)You... With me... (-Distant Echo-)Hydaelyn's champion... Apologies. I have been preoccupied for quite some time, and am...out of practice at conversation... Ever since this moon was created by Hydaelyn, I have served as...an integral part. I am the watcher. I am responsible for the prisoner and the devices that hold Him fast. Zodiark Himself. A projection of the moon's core. Though rent asunder by Hydaelyn, He grows more powerful with every Rejoining. Seven there have been. Seven too many... And yet, for all His servants' machinations, He remains incomplete. The fallen are beyond salvation. No attempt would be made to free Zodiark. Not until He is whole once more. But someone has taken action. The shackles that hold Him nearly shattered. Six locks to his gaol, great and grand. Gargantuan swords driven deep. Brands to bind Zodiark forevermore. Five were destroyed by his would-be liberator. One of these I have restored. I strive to mend the remaining four, but my efforts are being impeded... Souls sacrificed to summon Zodiark, their manifestation consequence of the waning seal. They labor in opposition to my work. They must be expelled for the preservation of all.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** What will you say? If keeping Zodiark imprisoned is the right thing to do, I will aid you. I will only resort to “expelling” them if all else fails.

**ANCIENTSHADOWA:** What is right and good? Ask a thousand souls and receive a thousand answers. I offer none. Of that I have no doubt. You are Her chosen. I am the watcher and the gaoler. I am not the judge. Know this. Hydaelyn commands the forces of stasis, and this moon is the product of such power. So long as Zodiark remains imprisoned in this place, no more sacrifices will be made in His name. Nor will those souls rendered up in His name fade into oblivion. Go. Meet with these wandering spirits. Do what you think is right.

**ANCIENTSHADOWB:** Our perfection came crumbling down. Such overwhelming despair. In that moment, we knew. The end was nigh. The faintest glimmer of hope remained. We gave our lives that others may live. We gave ourselves...to Zodiark.

**ANCIENTSHADOWC:** Zodiark...our lord and savior.

**ANCIENTSHADOWD:** To forge our world anew...

**ANCIENTSHADOWE:** To live and love again...

**ANCIENTSHADOWA:** Become one with the star...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Fill earth and heaven with life. Birth paradise where fear is distant memory.

**000:** (-???-)Pardon me, but would you be so kind as to step aside? (-Familiar Spirit-)Ah. That unmistakable color. The soul of Azem. (-Familiar Spirit-)But not the friend I knew, I think. Nevertheless, you are you. (-Familiar Spirit-)Hmm... So, Emet-Selch meant for you to have it. (-Familiar Spirit-)You seem surprised. Why might that be?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** What will you say? We meet again, Hythlodaeus. You're the receptionist at the Bureau of the Secretariat, correct?

**ZENOS:** Again? I do not believe I have yet had the pleasure. Chief of the Bureau of the Architect, in fact. My name is “Hythlodaeus.” But how did you come to be familiar with our bureaus? Emet-Selch created a shade in my likeness? And not only me, but all of Amaurot? Heh heh... How very like him... Heh heh heh... A slave to sentiment, even after an eternity. As you may have guessed, I am different from the shade you met before. No mere approximation, but the original. A soul sacrificed to Zodiark. We remember in vivid detail the events leading to our purgatory. The plans and plots for our resurrection. Hydaelyn's intervention, and Zodiark's─and the star's─final fate. And then we drifted in a waking dream, our minds steeped in fog...until you came. I know not what you and your friends intend for Zodiark or the future of the star. Nevertheless... In you I place my trust and faith. In you I choose to believe, as Emet-Selch did. Believe in yourself, and all will be well. Hmm, more new arrivals. Though... Ah. Fandaniel. That color I know. And another I do not. An unfamiliar but fearsome being... I have kept you from your duty. By way of apology, I will ensure that the shades hinder you no more. Protect the final brand. Fare you well, my new old friend.

**AMON:** Hmph...

**ZENOS:** In the nick of time to savor the crowning triumph. Unbound and free at last. Arise, Zodiark! Deprived of heart and will by the loss of dearest Elidibus... A creature of pure instinct, wanting for guidance... But powerful, oh so powerful. More so with every passing moment. Such potential, even in this incomplete state. Still the savior who delivered a world from certain doom.

**AMON:** So. Here we stand. You know my intent. Consume the god, then the world. Stoke your fury to a raging inferno and dance among the ashes. Or perhaps you would face me here and now? A lesser but welcome amusement. Yes... A taste to whet the appetite.

**ANCIENTSHADOWA:** Sorry to spoil the moment, but might I ask that you postpone the slaughter until I have said my piece? I promise I will be brief. Do you remember when I told you that I wanted to die and take everyone with me? I meant it.

**ANCIENTSHADOWB:** We are the savior.

**ANCIENTSHADOWC:** We are the guardian. The keeper of natural order.

**ANCIENTSHADOWD:** We are the martyr. The bestower of new beginnings.

**AMON:** We are...

**ANCIENTSHADOWE:**  Report if displayed. (-Fandaniel-)Such lofty aspirations! And what sweet irony that the world's saviors will become the agents of its destruction!

**ANCIENTSHADOWA:** It cannot end this way...

**ANCIENTSHADOWB:** We must return and be made whole!

**ANCIENTSHADOWD:** We are the will of the star, now and forever!

**AMON:** For the greater good! For the sake of the world!

**ANCIENTSHADOWC:** (-Fandaniel-)Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! Lies and delusion! (-Fandaniel-)The dead have no power over me. You will be silent─silent as the grave!  Report if displayed.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** No more, we beg of you... The star must endure...

**ZODIARK:** (-Familiar Stranger-)Believe, and walk in faith. Let the light of your soul shine for all to see. (-Familiar Stranger-)Not quite the outcome you'd imagined, but a fitting one nonetheless. (-Familiar Stranger-)Don't you think so, Hades?

**WATCHEROFMOON:** All I craved and more... Boundless power, mine to command... Hahaha... Ahahahaha... I had intended to pit my fractured divinity against Zenos...but a more tempting option presents itself. The greatest obstacle to my ambition. You will trouble me no longer. Establishing connection. All creation shall bend to my will... Is this the limit of your power!? Is this how it ends!?

**ZODIARK:** (-The Watcher-)Well done. My preparations are complete, and I stand ready to seal Zodiark once more. (-The Watcher-)Withdraw now from this place. The teleporter will deliver you to safety.

**ENDSINGER:** Haha...heh heh heh... Incomplete...and insufficient. Of course He was no match. Once again, you have left my best-laid plans in ruins... And played your role to perfection, thus sealing my victory! From the first, all I wanted was for you to kill Zodiark. 'Twas but one of many methods to achieve the desired effect. 'Twould've been the same had Zenos died in my place. But what better and more satisfying way to ensure success than to take control myself? My sole regret is that you live to tell the tale. Even so, I have fulfilled my heart's desire! Let your murder mark the beginning of the end... The coming of the Final Days! (-Fandaniel-)How quickly strength fades, and blood cools. Old, familiar sensations... (-Fandaniel-)So many lives. So many deaths. No different, this. I close my eyes and slip into the dreamless slumber. (-Fandaniel-)A tired song and dance. Routine. Always I wake. (-Fandaniel-)But not this time─hah! Nothing left unsaid, nothing left undone. Inherit my hell, I intone with glee. (-Fandaniel-)The man I was would weep for what I have become. The all-consuming contempt. (-Fandaniel-)But I've the wisdom of ten millennia to justify my answer to the question. No value in their existence─not a whit. For all that I looked, none that I did see. (-Fandaniel-)A final chance, then, for Hydaelyn and Her faithful. In cataclysm prove me wrong, I sneer. (-Fandaniel-)All shall return to nothingness. As was your will, Emperor Xande. (-Fandaniel-)I, the star, and every living being...consigned to your oblivion.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Ah...at last...

**ZENOS:** Deep breaths... Slow and steady... You saw it too, yes? The blue star below, thrown into turmoil. Then it was no illusion. All was truth. With the death of Zodiark, the laws of nature over which He presided have begun to unravel. The Final Days are upon us. What you witnessed was an omen granted by the Echo. A vision of the horrors to come. Time grows short.

**000:** (-Zenos-)No. I'll find no fulfillment in a contest with you this day. Slavering beasts gather at your gates, ravenous and eager. Already you turn to them and away from me. I must go forth once more in search of power far beyond the might of Shinryu─power to make your heart run over with rage. For the eldest of primals was a betrayal of promise. A pathetic creature incapable of inspiring true despair. Aye, that's what I crave─pure, unadulterated despair...

**ZENOS:** What will you say? Hope will win the day. I will not fight for your amusement.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**YSHTOLA:** I thank you for affording me this short reprieve...

**WATCHEROFMOON:** It is we who should thank you. The records stored here are nothing short of extraordinary. There is much we could learn of Zodiark and His imprisonment, but perhaps you could offer us more focused guidance. Pray tell us of the calamity that came before and comes now again.

**YSHTOLA:** Long ago, before the great sundering, there was but a single world─Etheirys. One day, from within the earth, a terrible cry issued forth, affecting a profound change in all manner of life. We were not exempt. Our creation magicks ran rampant, giving shape and form to thoughts of hopelessness and despair. At first, the phenomenon was limited to a single region. But quickly...so very quickly...it spread and engulfed the whole of the star.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Were the ancients ever able to deduce its source?

**YSHTOLA:** They were not. However, the Convocation struck upon a method to predict where next the corruption would manifest. The aetheric energies which flow through all of creation in the form of various currents. The currents which course through the land and seas... Those which flow through the very air... And those of a celestial nature which encompass both our star and this moon.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Celestial currents... I cannot say I am familiar with the concept.

**URIANGER:** Nor would I expect you to be. Few scholars of our time knew of their existence. Their invaluable knowledge helped us to better understand the nature of the calamity. Like the terrestrial ones of earth and air, the celestial currents form a vast network. But the aetherial distribution is not consistent. The Convocation soon realized that the inciting incidents occurred in regions where the flow was weakest. Correlation without clear cause, ultimately. Nevertheless, on closer study, a stagnancy of aether was observed in nearby currents...

**WATCHEROFMOON:** And so they sought a means to harness the forces of Darkness, of activity and growth. Thus was Zodiark conceived. No less a power than a god's could set right the laws of nature and quicken the flow of aether within the star.

**THANCRED:** Precisely. With the advent of Zodiark, our end was averted.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Emet-Selch claimed that those who summoned Hydaelyn did so because they saw Zodiark's power as a threat. Is that true?

**000:** Indeed, there was a faction opposed to Zodiark's creation. But their aim was never to unmake Him. They understood the continued preservation of the natural order was dependent on His very existence. Until we could identify and address the underlying cause of the Final Days, He would need remain, for His departure would set in motion those apocalyptic forces once more. Hydaelyn recognized this as well. And so, rather than destroy, She sundered Zodiark, Herself, and the star into lesser reflections, that She might confine Him in this place.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** What will you say? I could have sworn She beseeched me to banish the Darkness. Then what She told me in the aetherial sea was false...?

**YSHTOLA:** Perhaps She did. But as with all beings, intent is not always in accord with spoken word. That the two once dwelled as one until Zodiark grew hungry for power, upsetting the balance 'twixt Them...? Not quite a lie, though a rather gross embellishment. But knowing what you know now, you must surely realize why She might opt to obfuscate and mislead. Hydaelyn and Zodiark are both constructs of man. Approximations of perfection limited by our own imperfections. Zodiark was, without question, the more powerful of the two, having been born from the sacrifice of half Etheirys's population. Thus was it necessary for Hydaelyn to commit Herself wholly to His defeat. Still more effort was needed to confine Him. Maintaining the brands taxed Her greatly. With what power She dared spare, She cried out to any who might listen, and offered Her blessing to those who heeded Her call. Though it was likely within Her power to do so, I believe She did not wish to speak of Etheirys and Her history. Like Zodiark, Hydaelyn's purpose is a reflection of Her creators'. They wished to look to the future, and not linger in a prison of the past.

**THANCRED:** The Ascians set in motion seven Rejoinings before we came to oppose them. How many more worlds would have been lost had we not placed our faith in Her? How many more souls living in the present would have been snuffed out for the sake of those long dead?

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Well, in light of recent events, I see no reason to doubt your words. And even if Hydaelyn is not a god in truth, if Minfilia believed that we should trust in Her plans, then I choose to do just that. Which brings me to a rather important question. Let's suppose we try but fail to stop this second coming of the Final Days. Should the Source fall, what will become of the other worlds?

**YSHTOLA:** The nomenclature is more fitting than you know... Bring ruin to the Source, and its reflections will share in its fate. Ah, it is ready. This way, if you would be so kind. A beautiful sight, is it not?

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Yes, but what is it?

**THANCRED:** Hydaelyn knew better than any that Her power was not absolute. Indeed, She has ever struggled to hold Zodiark and His faithful at bay. She feared the worst, and so made preparations. In the event of His demise, there would be a contingency. This moon is more than a prison. It is a vessel capable of bearing the people of Etheirys to safe harbor. You need not go far to find its pilots. In fact, I should be happy to take you to them... ...And fulfill my final duty as watcher in the dark.

**LIVINGWAY:** Our “moonship” pilots should be around here somewhere, is that right?

**URIANGER:** (-???-)Look lively, everyone! (-???-)I know, I know─this one thousand two hundred and forty-third inspection is a mite ahead of schedule, but it is of the utmost importance! For Zodiark, alas, is no more. (-???-)As of now, our mighty moon has a new purpose! To bear the people of Etheirys to safety! (-???-)Our time is come, my friends! (-???-)We must be swifter than swift! There is much to do before our guests arrive. (-???-)I expect your work stations to be immaculate. And don't forget to relay our signal to Etheirys! (-???-)Questions? Yes? No? Maybe so? No? Then hop to it!

**THANCRED:** 'Tis a rather curious crew She hath chosen. Their endearing forms intended to ease the passengers' hearts, perhaps.

**LIVINGWAY:** Perhaps...

**MAPPINGWAY:** (-Snappy Loporrit-)Right, of course! Introductions are in order. Ahem! My name is Livingway, and we are the Loporrits. Created for the express purpose of commanding this ship and bearing the people of Etheirys to a brave new world! More specifically, *I* am the one whom She charged with the execution of Her most vital plans. You might say I'm Her right paw!

**THANCRED:** Mappingway's the name. Map reader and navigator of the heavens.

**LIVINGWAY:** Pleasure to meet you all, but...I'm still trying to make sense of...this.

**URIANGER:** Confusion and bewilderment are completely understandable. Fear not! I shall walk you through it. The people of Etheirys─through no fault of your own, I'm sure─set in motion a series of events that, unfortunately, culminated in Zodiark's obliteration. Acutely aware of the imminent crisis, your parents sent you little ones on ahead while they began the necessary preparations. Still not following? No? Very well! I shall elaborate further! Here we have Etheirys─your home─and the moon, where we are now. Without Zodiark around to keep things lively, so to speak, the celestial currents of the star have doubtless begun to degrade. A calamity of apocalyptic proportions will be visited upon Etheirys, bringing an end to all life. Very sad, that.

**LIVINGWAY:** So too hath the watcher claimed. By thine unperturbed countenance, I gather this eventuality was anticipated?

**YSHTOLA:** The doom and gloom? Oh yes, quite expected. Imagine, if you will, that Etheirys is a delicious carrot that I've forgotten to eat and left out in the midday sun. The most earnest wishes or prayers will not stop it from rotting to the core. So, sadly, there's nothing to be done but to abandon said carrot─Etheirys, in case the metaphor is lost on you─to its grisly fate.

**LIVINGWAY:** ...And this moon will serve as the vessel to deliver us to a new home.

**YSHTOLA:** Just so! We will gather up as many people, supplies, and resources as our stores will hold. And then, once everyone is aboard, it's off to another star! Easier said than done, admittedly, for one does not simply hop from star to star on a whim. Which is precisely why we've spent countless years constructing the most propulsive of propulsion systems! We ought to make it to our destination in two shakes of a rabbit's tail.

**LIVINGWAY:** Impressive technology. I daresay it is beyond anything we have ever seen.

**THANCRED:** No need to shower us with praise. All we've done is faithfully carry out the instructions left to us by Hydaelyn. Back in the old days, when She was still just Venat, She was dedicated to the study of the world and its inner workings. And the watcher─the real one, not the simulacrum you met─was one of Her fellow researchers. We and this wondrous vessel masquerading as a moon are products of their knowledge and know-how.

**MAPPINGWAY:** There's certainly more to you all than meets the eye. Might I ask where exactly you intend to take us?

**LIVINGWAY:** We identified a few promising candidates for resettlement some time ago, but we cannot guarantee that they are fit for habitation. Moreover, the ship can only travel in short bursts. We intend to go down our list, hopping from star to star, until we find one suitable for resettlement.

**THANCRED:** No need to worry, though. The vessel is being refurbished with accommodation for an extended stay as we speak. While we did have to rely upon outside help to determine what amenities were essential, I daresay we have risen to the challenge.

**LIVINGWAY:** Help? From who?

**THANCRED:** From you and yours, who else? Each time we woke to perform regularly scheduled maintenance, we were greeted by the resources you sent us. What better way to learn about the preferences and proclivities of our present-day charges? Ah, but you're still adorable little children. Perhaps your elders were responsible for the deliveries?

**LIVINGWAY:** I'm not sure what led you to conclude otherwise, but I can assure you that we are all grown men and women. And I very much doubt my “elders” know this place exists, much less how to send you so much as a Starlight missive.

**YSHTOLA:** What? Then who in blazes let you on *my* moon!? Hydaelyn *Herself* led you here? You don't say! Well, that's... Really? Not children? Then why are you so small and stunted? Like little baby carrot people?

**LIVINGWAY:** While Amaurotines were a great deal taller, in the present day, persons of such prodigious size are exceedingly rare.

**URIANGER:** So...you're saying everyone's not like the watcher? Confound it all! Someone could've at least scribbled a note about your profound miniaturization...

**LIVINGWAY:** That tome in thy possession...

**THANCRED:** Oh, this? One of the first books sent to us. A compendium of the people of Etheirys─with a few blank pages at the back for minor corrections and updates as needed. The sum total of our knowledge of your kind is contained in these pages. I thought it was abridged and made small for our benefit, but...this isn't a regular-sized book, is it? Ahhh! Buildingway, can you hear me? Yes, we're all very busy. Change of plans. I need you to rebuild the domiciles at one-third the scale. All of them. Yes, *all* of them! And but me no buts! See to it with all speed!

**LIVINGWAY:** Perhaps you could tell us a bit more about your terrestrial collaborators.

**GROWINGWAY:** Yes, yes, in due time─but first I'd like to hear more about *you*, if it's all the same. I'd rather not risk any other complications due to outdated knowledge of our passengers-to-be.

**URIANGER:** Readying the teleporter. Huh? Access to living quarters restricted due to reconstruction? Then where is it... Oh no!

**LIVINGWAY:** A private audience, as thou didst request. For reasons I know not...

**URIANGER:** Just a precaution. I'd rather I didn't have to ask the question at all, but I take my responsibilities very, very seriously. Do you and your friends, by any chance, find our accommodation wanting? Be honest. Brutally, even.

**LIVINGWAY:** 'Twould be ungracious of me to belittle the efforts of thee and thine.

**URIANGER:** Lovely sentiment, really, but the disappointment is writ plain on your comrades' faces. It's all the more frustrating since no one will come out and say what they find wanting! If there are faults in our work, we need to know. We can─we will─do better. But time is not on our side. The Final Days will wait for no one. If your people are to be saved, we must take quick and decisive action. This vessel must serve as a home for as many passengers as possible─for far longer than we may like. Which brings me to my request. Our collaborators on Etheirys are doing what they can to prepare for the voyage. Would you be willing to go and lend them a hand? Having seen the moon for yourself, you could speak to its many splendors. Learn what else they might require and assuage whatever concerns they have.

**LIVINGWAY:** Wherefore wouldst thou entrust me with such a task?

**URIANGER:** How to put it... You're the only one who appears not to be wholly unsatisfied with our work. Or quite good at pretending that's the case, at least. Calm, collected, tactful to a fault─very particular with your words, too. You understand that, in the face of great danger, one cannot pursue perfection at the expense of practicality. That difficult choices must often be made for the greater good.

**LIVINGWAY:** And so fate doth conspire to set my feet upon this path once more...

**URIANGER:** Come again?

**GROWINGWAY:** Ah, idle musings. 'Tis no trifle thou dost ask, yet full well do I understand the urgency...and necessity... I...

**URIANGER:** Oh, dear me, dear me! I'm terribly sorry for the mix-up! It's a bit of a malfunction. I hadn't realized the residential quarters were inaccessible, you see... But you're still in one piece, so all's well that ends well, yes? Won't happen again. I promise!

**000:** Thine arrival is timely as ever. Thou didst chance to overhear my conversation with Livingway, I presume? 'Twas not mine intent to move in shadow. Nevertheless, I have been asked to do that and more yet again... Is it so plain that these strangers could intuit it at a glance? My capacity for silence and secrecy...and duplicity. When G'raha Tia did contrive to deliver the First at the price of his own life, I was complicit in the scheme. A sacrifice averted, for a mercy. Would that I could say the same for Minfilia. One life for one world. And by that bloody bargain brokered by my hand were the Scions robbed of a dear comrade, and F'lhaminn her beloved daughter. Two souls whose selflessness was beyond measure, whose resolve was unshakable. They would not be moved even had I thought to protest. But protest I did not. Far from it. I pushed them forward. No effort did I make to seek out alternatives. Ones that would not demand such terrible costs. That resignation weigheth heavy on my mind, as does the memory of another lost to mine inaction. Dearest Moenbryda, who did face death unflinching, that we might secure a means to bring low the Ascians. In her hour of need, I did naught. Dutiful disciple of Louisoix, ever looking to the greater good... Had I shut mine eyes and bid her live instead, mayhap she would be with us today. Selfish wants born of everlasting regrets. Most days I put them from my mind, but could think of naught else when asked to swallow the same bitter draught. Subterfuge and sacrifice. Mayhap the right, moral choice, but one I regard with great trepidation. The calamity of Amaurot was a tragedy beyond reckoning. One which must never again come to pass. Thus must we struggle. Haunted by ghosts of those we have lost. Clinging to those we pray we can yet save. But what of those we cannot? How do we make peace with the dreadful algebra of necessity?

**URIANGER:** What will you say? Sometimes there's no right answer. Have faith in yourself and your decisions. Take heart and protect well those you can. Would that we had time to weigh the costs...

**LIVINGWAY:** I am not alone in my discomfort, then? 'Tis surprising...though perhaps not. We Scions are wont to debate strategy at length, but are resolute and unwavering in execution. Sage counsel indeed... I see. Wisdom as befits a great wyrm. Curious that he should think thee in need of such encouragement. 'Tis a comfort to know we are of like mind in that regard. Strange... Scarcely can I remember when last we spoke alone, and so candidly. I thank thee. For all my supposed skill with words, I find it difficult to express such private thoughts. As for the Loporrits' proposition...I will take time and consider how to respond. 'Twould be to our mutual benefit if we could converse more openly with our aspiring caretakers... ...A concern I should be glad to address on the Scions' behalf. To dispense with all pretense and bare one's heart to another is a frightening thing indeed. But we cannot move forward ere we take that bold first step. A lesson I have learned many times before...and today.

**URIANGER:** What are they saying? Curse these ears─I've heard bugger all! No matter. We've got our plans.

**LIVINGWAY:** ...And what, pray tell, do we seek at the Watcher's Palace?

**URIANGER:** Oh, come off it, friend! You know full well why we're here. The time has come for you to return to Etheirys and help your brethren prepare for their journey here and beyond!

**MAPPINGWAY:** Forgive me, Livingway, but I cannot in good conscience proceed with this plan.

**URIANGER:** Huh!? But what about the Final Days? The death and the doom!? We have to hurry before it's too late!

**PUDDINGWAY:** Your unflagging commitment to your duty is endearing, to say the least.

**URIANGER:** Oh, bugger!

**LIVINGWAY:** Be at ease. They bear you no grudge, nor do I. How could we, having come to understand your purpose? For millennia, you and yours worked tirelessly towards the singular purpose of this heavenly vessel's construction. An arduous feat by any measure. 'Tis clear you have spared no effort. Why, your very names are a testament to your dedication.

**URIANGER:** Our...our names? I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at...

**SINGINGWAY:** Names are an expression of the self─a declaration of one's hopes and aspirations. Your use of contemporary, uncomplicated nomenclature doth ensure clarity of purpose. There can be no doubt that your love for the people of Etheirys is boundless and pure.

**MAPPINGWAY:** Yes, yes! A most mellifluous phrasing! We Loporrits were born of Hydaelyn's love for Etheirys. That shining, shimmering blue jewel. Brightest star in the sky! Brimming with life and possibilities.

**LIVINGWAY:** For as long as I can remember I've toiled in anticipation of the day when this vessel might be needed. All I've ever wanted was to meet those She cherished so dearly. To serve and serve well!

**URIANGER:** That goes for all of us, don't you see? So help us─help us help them! Lead them here, where we can keep them safe! If there's anything wrong with what we've built, we'll fix it! We'll make it right!

**PUDDINGWAY:** Your works want not for repair. Yet there remaineth much for you to learn of men, and your own kin besides. Singingway. Thy name bespeaketh more than the simple marriage of rhythm and rhyme. The songs of Etheirys are beyond counting, and span the length and breadth of emotion. Maps are monuments to man's pioneering spirit and his devotion to charting the furthest reaches of our star. Many have devoted their lifetimes to exploratory pursuits. To venture unto the highest mountains and the deepest oceans, in search of unknown frontiers. And thou, my friend. I... Hmm. I do not think we have met.

**URIANGER:** My...my name is Puddingway...

**LIVINGWAY:** Puddingway... Yes, indeed. A name of deep and abiding significance, I am sure, but one perhaps better communicated through delicious deeds than tasteless words. A judicious application of fae magicks at a later juncture may be appropriate... And Livingway. 'Tis no easy feat to convey the significance of thy moniker. Hmmm... When I was a bookish boy, a dear friend of mine was fond of peppering me with questions as I read─to my occasional annoyance. One day I posed to her a question of mine own─what doth it mean to live? After much contemplation, she proffered this answer. The anticipation of a half-read story's conclusion. The hope today's mistake may serve as tomorrow's lesson. The wish that a new acquaintance may one day call thee friend. She believed it to be all these moments and more.

**URIANGER:** I...I want to understand, but...

**LIVINGWAY:** I, too, still labor to find mine own answer. 'Twould be my pleasure to assist you and yours in embarking on a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. For thee. Ink as blue as the waters of Etheirys. Made in haste, though I assure thee the quality has not suffered for it. The people need not be persuaded by honeyed words. Nay, I have faith they shall do what is right in due course. Until they do, I beg your patience, friends. And with that ink let us fill the empty pages of Livingway's compendium. An open exchange of ideas will surely afford you all a better understanding of modern man─and with it, ideas for improvements and renovations. But more importantly, it shall empower us to together find a way forward.

**URIANGER:** I hope you're right. Thank you for this lovely gift.

**THANCRED:** There you have it. I shall remain with the Loporrits to ensure that all is in order. Though we must needs prepare for every eventuality, you would all agree that the evacuation of our star is a last resort. To accept failure is to accept the demise not only of our star, but that of Ryne's. Of all reflections, and the souls that call them home. Which is why I have every faith that you shall fight to the last. That such drastic measures may prove unnecessary.

**URIANGER:** Should the worst come to the worst─and I pray deeply that it won't─I'll take comfort in knowing preparations were made under your watchful eye.

**WATCHEROFMOON:** Aye, thou mayest be assured that if calamity cometh, not a soul will be left behind. “If” being the operative term.

**LIVINGWAY:** That flower... How came it into your possession? How very like Her. Guided by its light, you may come to know Her true intentions. Intentions which remain a mystery even to us. In our time, we called it “Elpis”... You would do well to remember the name.

**YSHTOLA:** Er, I hate to interrupt, but...I feel like I need to make amends for all the secrecy.

**LIVINGWAY:** Think nothing of it─we haven't been the most gracious of guests. Do convey our apologies to Growingway and the others.

**YSHTOLA:** But of course! And when next we welcome more guests from Etheirys, we'll have learned to be much more hospitable hosts! Oh, and circling back to the matter of inappropriate secrecy, we ought to discuss our benefactors.

**LIVINGWAY:** Agreed. The Sharlayan Forum, yes?

**YSHTOLA:** What!? How did you know!?

**BARNIER:** The more I heard, the more obvious it became. The Forum's aims align closely with those of your anonymous patrons. “A telling coincidence” would be an understatement. Though had we not taken it upon ourselves to peruse certain restricted tomes in Labyrinthos, we might still be unaware of their plans. ...But let us continue this discussion upon our return. I daresay we have kept Alphinaud and the others waiting long enough.

**SHARLAYANCITIZENA:** Order! Order, I say! I thank you all for gathering here on such short notice. This day we must speak of grave affairs and their implications for the future of Sharlayan─nay, of this very star. Said affairs concern all citizens, and so we have called for a public assembly. You may have heard rumors of the Telophoroi, and the havoc these madmen wreak abroad. Under normal circumstances, we would pay little heed to petty disturbances outside our borders. The “Final Days,” however, are another matter altogether... ...For we dare not ignore these prophetic words of eld: “The end-bearers will come, ushering chaos and calamity. The Final Days descend and devour the very star...”

**SHARLAYANCITIZENB:** I've never heard this prophecy.

**BARNIER:** Is it true? Will all that really happen?

**LEGISLATORA:** Calm yourselves. The time is come to speak of the Forum's most sacred duties. But first...

**BARNIER:** Give voice to the voiceless. Let bindings be unbound. By unanimous decree, I declare the enchantment broken!

**FOURCHENAULT:** Master Leveilleur, if you would.

**BARNIER:** Very well... Two hundred and seventy years ago, our forebears began an expedition in the Dravanian hinterlands, in search of a route to access the aetherial sea. This much is public knowledge. Their findings, however, would become the Forum's most closely guarded secret. What those researchers discovered in the hinterlands was not a passage unto the aetherial sea, but the very heart of our star─and Hydaelyn Herself. She spoke to them of a calamity that would extinguish all life, and of a means by which we might be spared. The moon. 'Tis in truth a gargantuan vessel built to serve as sanctuary for Her children and deliver them from this doom. Much like *Nyunkrepf's Hope* in ages past, it will bear the people of a world in the throes of death to a new home.

**SHARLAYANCITIZENA:** Needless to say, this would be no small undertaking. To facilitate the great work, the Forum has maintained close contact with the servants of Hydaelyn who presently reside on the moon. Convinced that the foretold end was all but inevitable, we began amassing a wealth of knowledge. Not merely for the betterment of our nation, but in preparation for the journey to come.

**BARNIER:** You reveal this to us now? By the gods, how long do we have!?

**FOURCHENAULT:** While we cannot say with certainty, we believe the hour to be nigh. We received a transmission from the moon suggesting as much not long ago. Which is why we must in earnest begin preparations for the great exodus. For his impressive contributions and the leadership he demonstrated during our withdrawal from Dravania, we have elected Master Leveilleur to oversee this initiative.

**BARNIER:** Fellow scribes and scholars. My countrymen. We face a threat of unprecedented scale. We must challenge the trials before us with composure and conviction if we are to find salvation. The wisdom of Sharlayan has ever been a shining beacon in the darkness, and so it shall continue to be. It is our solemn charge to see our heritage preserved for future generations. For those who will come after, we will brave a new frontier.

**ALISAIE:** Administrative edicts will be relayed to all major institutions ere long. In the meantime, carry on with your duties. With that, I hereby call this assembly to a close.

**ALPHINAUD:** Do you remember what Mother told us when we visited home? That it wasn't until after we were born that Father seemed to lose himself in his work. If that *great work* of his was the evacuation of this star, then...

**000:** Yes... It wasn't for his benefit... Would you mind waiting here a moment? I wish to speak with Father before we leave.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Take your time. Keep it civil, eh?

**ALISAIE:** Thank you. I shan't be long. I may look daggers at him, but I will neither speak nor draw them.

**FOURCHENAULT:** If it's all the same to you, I have a few choice words to share with Father as well.

**ALPHINAUD:** So. Come to call us cowards and bid us join your fruitless battle against the inevitable?

**FOURCHENAULT:** Nay, we do not object to the Forum's proposal. On the contrary, those who wish to flee have every right to do so. Urianger is cooperating with your associates on the moon to ensure that all is ready should evacuation be our only recourse.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then whatever your business, I suggest you be brief.

**ALISAIE:** Though we cannot boast the boundless wisdom of Sharlayan, we have firsthand knowledge of foreign cultures, and have conversed with no small number of peoples. These experiences have taught us fundamental truths that cannot be recorded in any tome, nor charted on any map. The beating heart of this planet is its people, many of whom would give anything─even their lives─to protect the lands they love. Many may choose to join you in the end. But what of those unwilling or unable, for whom escape will never be an option? What would you have them do? To ignore the plight of those one might conceivably save is not wisdom, Father. It is indolence. This is why we choose to fight.

**FOURCHENAULT:** We'll not ask for your understanding, Father. Only that you don't turn a blind eye to the good we have done. That we can still do. We're not children in need of protection. Hold fast to your principles and let the world burn, if it please, but we believe there is still another way. And if there is, we will find it. You see if we don't.

**YSHTOLA:** Do as you will. Just stay out of our way.

**ESTINIEN:** Were he not so consumed with self-righteousness, he might tell you how proud he is of you both.

**ALISAIE:** Bold words call for bold action. And there'll be no turning to your father should plans go awry.

**THANCRED:** As if I ever would. So long as there are those who wish to stay and fight for this star, we have to do what we can to help them.

**ALPHINAUD:** And if we're to do that, we'll need to be well rested. Wouldn't you agree? Having triumphed over what we once thought to be the source of all evil, I can think of no one in greater need of at least a dozen winks.

**ENDSINGER:** Shall we, then? To the annex, to prepare for tomorrow!

**SYSTEM:**  

**000:** A visitor has come knocking at your door. Whoever could it be?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Alphinaud? Alisaie? Thancred? Y'shtola? G'raha Tia? Estinien?

**ALISAIE:** Ah. I hope I didn't wake you. I pray you will forgive the unannounced visit, but I wished to speak with you before retiring for the night... ...About Garlemald, and the time we spent with the people of Tertium. Dangerous though it was, I'm glad we had the opportunity to treat with Jullus and Quintus. I was worried what might happen after we were collared. If they attempted to restrain you too. If they succeeded... Once more I put you in harm's way. And for that I must apologize... Or rather...I should thank you. For trusting in me, time and time again. After all our journeys together, I daresay I've used every expression imaginable to convey to you my gratitude. Nevertheless, I hope these words of mine still carry some small weight. Tomorrow our fight continues. Mayhap it would have been better to seek you out after we have true cause for celebration... But having mustered the courage to stand up to Father and achieve a personal victory of sorts, I wanted to carry on in that spirit before my nerves got the better of me. The hour grows late, and you doubtless tire of my ramblings. I have a letter for Arenvald to finish, but will be off to bed shortly. Sleep well.

**THANCRED:** Craving a midnight snack, were you? I did consider bringing a few sweets, but decided this wasn't an appropriate occasion. I couldn't sleep. Had a few things on my mind. I know it's late, so I'll try not to talk your ear off... It's Zenos. I keep thinking back to Garlemald, when he'd taken control of your body. An altogether terrifying experience, to say the least. And one that served as a harsh reminder. No one─no matter how strong or quick or clever─is invincible. Not even you. And as much as it might seem at times that you are...one misstep. One mistake...and that's that. Which is why, even though I know you've heard it a thousand times before, I'm going to tell you to take better care of yourself. Because you really, really should. It goes without saying that we're all committed to this fight, but that doesn't mean that we need to throw our lives away. You know how I feel about noble sacrifices. Right─that's settled! We'll be keeping the acts of gratuitous bravado to a minimum. When I looked Father in the eye and swore we'd find a way to avert this tragedy... It wasn't a promise just for him. It was a promise for you, too.

**YSHTOLA:** Evening. I hoped you hadn't crawled beneath the covers just yet. If you'll indulge me for a moment, I have a favor to ask. Don't worry. Nothing desperate or dire, if that's what you were wondering. Not yet. You know, we may have quite literally entered our final days. The ancients went so far as to call it that for a reason. If so, then everything we did for Ryne, for the First...will have been meaningless. And I can't accept that. I just can't. My mind won't allow for the possibility...and that could be a problem. When we're in the thick of it, I don't know if I've got it in me to be pragmatic this time. To run...even if running's the right choice. The only choice. So if you see me turning a blind eye to the harsh reality...beat some sense into me, would you? I trust you and the other Scions with my life, and I'd like to think the feeling is at least occasionally mutual. And I'd never forgive myself if my stubbornness put them in danger. Gods, listen to me. I'm beginning to sound like the father I never had. So, can I count on you to keep me in line? I can think of no one else more eminently qualified. Excellent! Now I can breathe a bit easier. Which isn't to say that I will, given what we're up against. Let's keep this little chat our secret. I'd rather not have anyone scolding us for burning the midnight oil.

**GRAHATIA:** You're still awake. Good. Might I trouble you to stand still for a moment? Hmmm. Nothing appears out of the ordinary. A precautionary measure. You will recall that serving as a vessel for abundant Light in the First very nearly ended poorly. In your recent battle on the moon, you were almost certainly exposed to similar, if not greater forces. Fortunately, from what I can see, you and your aether are none the worse for wear. Would that Ryne were here to confirm my assessment... To think you actually found yourself in a direct confrontation with Zodiark... As if Zenos gallivanting about in your body was not misfortune enough. Did you so grossly offend every single deity in a past life that they saw fit to place a curse upon your soul? Forgive me, that was in poor taste. I recall vividly how battered and broken it was in the depths of Amaurot. Would that you could have seen it with your own eyes. Mayhap then you would understand why the greater part of me is glad you did not. It was...a horror beyond description. Promise me you will be careful. That you will seek my counsel if you feel unwell. That puts my heart at ease, if only a touch. I suspect it will grow colder as the night wears on, so do be sure to stay warm. Sleep well, and may the shadows keep you.

**ESTINIEN:** Oh, apologies. I-I didn't mean to... Ahem. If you could spare a moment before bed... Thank you. I fear this may be the last quiet night we have to talk for quite some time. I am...troubled, of late. Unwarranted concerns, perhaps. I hope. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to share them with you. Though you have bested your enemies thus far─Zenos, and even Zodiark─your victories have come at a considerable cost to yourself. No one is without their limits─and you are no exception. I worry the added weight of the Final Days will prove more than you can bear. It is surely too much for any one woman... But you needn't bear it alone. Let me share your burden. My, um...carrying capacity pales in comparison to yours, but I could still help. Shoulder the occasional satchel from your ever-growing mountain of, um...baggage. You have already done so much to help relieve me of mine own encumbrances. 'Tis only fair that I repay you in kind. Of course, it needn't be only troubles we share. Moments of joy may seem few and far between now, but there will come a time when we look back fondly on this journey. The inquiry at the Forum, our march through the snows of Garlemald, our impromptu dinner in this very room─all of it. And that is to say nothing of the journeys yet to come. To the ends of the world and beyond! Ahem. But tomorrow will be no less busy than today, and I have kept you from your rest long enough. Sleep well, my friend.

**SYSTEM:** You're alone... Good. The twins thought now would be a wonderful time to pay a visit to my chambers. Rather than listen to them bicker over tonight's snacks and tomorrow's plans, I seized the first opportunity to make my escape. To their credit, they decided against intruding on your peace and quiet. It can all be a bit...exhausting at times, can't it? I wasn't sure what to make of you at first. During the Dragonsong War, how quick you were to take up a cause not your own. But I came to see that is simply the way of you and yours. I will not pretend to understand this talk of ancient primals and the Final Days. But I trust in your judgment and choose to believe in your cause. You and Alphinaud have my lance. Now and always. You will need it, wrack and ruin looming on the horizon. Calamity bearing down upon us. There's no place I'd rather be than here. Standing shoulder to shoulder with friends on the front line. So do not hesitate to send me against your enemies. I'll make them rue the day they met me. Now, if you'll excuse me. I could do with a little air. If Alphinaud asks... I was never here. Until the morrow.

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** A short while earlier, in the Ala Mhigan Quarter...

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENB:** Thank the gods that tower is gone. The sight of it was enough to make me sick...

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** Thank the Ilsabard contingent, more like. Word is they fought their way into Garlemald and toppled the bloody thing themselves. Not just the one, neither─all the towers have up and vanished.

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENB:** Aye, I heard the same. Commander Aldynn and his troops helped keep casualties to a minimum, too. But is it true they brought back tempered Garlean soldiers?

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENA:** As Commander Aldynn tells it, they've a treatment for that now. But don't you worry─cured or not, they've no plans to bring them into the city proper.

**ALAMHIGANCITIZENB:** I see. Well, that's a relief, then. I know we've brothers and sisters among the lot, but I can't say I'm eager to welcome them home...

**SYSTEM:** Won't need to think about it for a while yet. They're to be looked after in Ala Gannha for the time being...

**ERENVILLE:** Meanwhile, in Ishgard...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALISAIE:** And lo, vile beasts did rise... Leaving naught in their wake but blood and ash. Sun scorches earth and boils seas... And our sins ascend unto the heavens─ Three dooms to unmake all we were.

**AWAHEEN:** The sky burns. The Final Days...are truly upon us.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...My friends. I trust you have heard the news.

**AWAHEEN:** We have. What can you tell us of the situation, Your Excellency?

**ESTINIEN:** Last night, the isle was rocked by tremors, and the earth itself cried out. Aloft, the heavens began to burn. From all about, unholy beasts─the likes of which we had never seen─came forth in fury and rage. ...No. To say they “came forth” would be...inexact. The people of Radz-at-Han themselves transformed into these baleful fiends. Though the phenomenon was observed throughout our lands, the first creature─the largest and most dreadful of the lot─wrought havoc upon us here, in our fair city. Though they bear superficial resemblance to divinities of legend, they are ungodly abominations. The people decry them as “blasphemies.” The large one's rampage has since taken it to the northern reaches of the island. I mean to dispatch our Radiant Host in an attempt to quell the threat.

**AWAHEEN:** And what of Vrtra?

**ALPHINAUD:** Vrtra, too, makes for the north of his own accord. And yet... He knows the blasphemy and its minions were but yesterday his beloved people. I pray his boundless compassion and mercy does not deter him from taking unenviable but necessary action.

**AWAHEEN:** ...Understood. I ask that you allow us to aid you in quelling this threat.

**ALISAIE:** You would risk your lives to help us yet again? I have no words to express my gratitude. Our regiments approach the north from several directions, with a number of units set to depart from the docks of Yedlihmad. They will make landfall in an area of dense jungle, where one can expect to encounter dangers even beyond the fell beasts we hunt. I leave you to your preparation. You will find me at the docks when you are ready to depart.

**FAKEGODBEAST:** We're as prepared as we'll ever be. Let's go.

**YSHTOLA:** Grrraaaoooooohhhhhh! Aaaaaaaaaggghhh! Rrrrrruuu...ined. I'm...rrruuuined...

**ALPHINAUD:** As I feared...

**YSHTOLA:** What is it?

**THANCRED:** The beast was there...and now it is no more, yes?

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed, we saw it plain. But...you didn't, did you?

**ALPHINAUD:** I saw nothing. Not the blasphemy that perished here, nor the other men-turned-beasts. And because of this, I now see all too well... There is no aether. Where the creatures should be, I saw naught but emptiness...

**YSHTOLA:** Emptiness? But that would mean...

**ALISAIE:** Recall the words of the watcher. 'Twas a stagnancy of aether─a cessation of flow leading to decay and absence─that led the ancients to conclude their star was dying... This is the same phenomenon. The instant these people are seized by the transformation, their aether begins to...rot and crumble away like dried mud... Until, from their corporeal forms to their very souls, naught remains...

**YSHTOLA:** But the beast spoke with its dying breath! Surely, at least a sliver of the man it was endured!

**ALISAIE:** ...Mayhap so. But even if the process was incomplete, 'twas little more than a faint residue.

**YSHTOLA:** Gods be good... You're saying they cannot be saved?

**GRAHATIA:** Not by any means known to me. ...Or by any means at all, like as not. For there is naught left to save.

**VRITRA:** They return not even to the aetherial sea...

**AWAHEEN:** The beasts rage on, their hunger insatiable... Even deprived of their master, they perpetuate his legacy of hate. Once proud sons and daughters of Thavnair, all of them...and now I spill their blood!

**ESTINIEN:** Vrtra! My friends! I am heartened to see you safe.

**AWAHEEN:** You put your secret at risk.

**VRITRA:** Those closest to me already know the truth─a truth I must now share with one and all. ...Vrtra. Calamity has come to Radz-at-Han. Our fair nation is rent by screams of pain and despair. More than ever, we require a strong leader to shepherd us through the storm. Reveal your true self to our people, Vrtra, and guide us to salvation!

**ESTINIEN:** What madness is this, Ahewann? Thou dost forget thyself. Were we to reveal our duplicity, it would do naught but foster confusion and chaos. Nay, I shall remain the satrap's loyal ally, and do battle with the beasts. Easing hearts and leading the people to safety is thy task, and thine alone. I ask that you remain at Ahewann's side, and render unto him what aid you may. I know not what lies ahead, but without you, Radz–at–Han will not survive.

**VRITRA:** ...Take me with you. I am as at home fighting in the air as I am on land. Take me with you.

**THANCRED:** Were my words unclear? I require no assistance. Thy place is at Ahewann's side.

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien─here. It's the last thing you ever wanted─a linkpearl. We'd gain much from knowing your elevated perspective. And it'll keep you from getting lonely─which I know you loathe.

**VRITRA:**   You heard the man. Seems I'm coming with you after all.

**ESTINIEN:** Then I pray thy grip is iron. Be it on thy head if thou dost chance to fall.

**AWAHEEN:** Fair enough. Now─shall we?

**ALPHINAUD:** I fear it is as Vrtra says: we will not survive this on our own. While I am loath to impose upon you again...

**AWAHEEN:** I would insist if you did not. 'Tis the very reason we have come.

**YSHTOLA:** Then once more I find myself without words to thank you properly. Let us return to the capital and plan our next course of action.

**GRAHATIA:** There you are. You've spoken with the survivors?

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. We thought to share what we have gleaned, that we might together gain a greater understanding of present circumstances.

**YSHTOLA:** Fortuitous timing. Alisaie and I completed our own investigations not long ago.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then we should take a moment to compare notes. Shall we begin with the two of you?

**ALISAIE:** ...So the merchant Khalzahl was gravely concerned about his business in the days preceding his untimely end.

**ALPHINAUD:** The tales we heard were much the same. The first victims to be changed into blasphemies were all overcome with anguish of one manner or another. Then those who saw their loved ones stolen before their eyes succumbed to a similar panic, setting in motion a chain of transformations.

**YSHTOLA:** Fear, unease, despair...these negative feelings serve as a catalyst.

**ALPHINAUD:** If so, then it is not unlike the calamity that befell the ancients. With their creation magicks they unwittingly gave form to untold horrors. Had they simply lost control, surely it would have manifested in many forms─not all of them monstrous. Yet somehow this phenomenon is triggered solely by the darkness in their hearts. A common thread with what we now witness.

**GRAHATIA:** ...Common, but not identical. While the beasts the ancients faced were forged with magic alone, those of today are born of sentient beings. Why remains to be seen, but there is one fundamental difference between us and our predecessors: our souls are sundered, whereas theirs were not. Perhaps that single variable makes all the difference.

**ALISAIE:** If I may...there was another detail that troubled me. We have it on good authority that Khalzahl's transformation took place before the skies began to burn.

**HANNISHMANA:** What!? If that's true, then the situation's more dire than we realized. It means even if there's no ominous sign presaging the Final Days, anyone─anywhere─has the potential to become a beast. Even in lands we thought safe. Even as we speak...

**HANNISHBOYA:** Look, it's the satrap!

**HANNISHWOMANA:** The satrap!

**AWAHEEN:** Thank the heavens...

**HANNISHOLDWOMANA:** My countrymen. I am relieved and heartened to see you strong and safe. While the danger has not yet passed─far from it─allow me to assure you that the beasts that raged within the city walls have been exterminated to the last. Outside this sanctuary, the brave men and women of the Radiant Host and our dragon ally continue to battle our unholy foes. I pray these tidings put your minds at ease, and help you calm your hearts. Have faith that we shall soon conquer this terrible trial.

**AWAHEEN:** Your Excellency...is there any word from Palaka's Stand? My grandson was bound for there yesterday, and I-I worry for his life...

**MATSYA:** We are still awaiting a report. But I promise you, as soon as I have aught to share...

**AWAHEEN:** (-???-)Y-Your Excellency! I bring grave news!

**MATSYA:** You are...?

**THANCRED:** I...I'm Matsya of Akyaali. A humble fisherman.

**MATSYA:** Ah, I remember you from our first visit.

**HANNISHOLDWOMANA:** Hm? Wait, you're... B-But no, that can wait! When the skies turned red, I set off for Palaka's Stand, fearing for the safety of a friend. But as I drew near the village, I saw dreadful beasts all about.

**AWAHEEN:** No... Gods have mercy... Your Excellency! Save my grandson! I beg of you!

**HANNISHOLDWOMANA:** We will spare no effort to save all we can. But you must remain calm─

**YSHTOLA:** Calm!? You tell me to be calm!? You saw those beasts! They tore our bravest warriors limb from limb! What if we are too late? If they catch him─sink their fangs into him... The fangs...the blood...the screams!

**HANNISHOLDWOMANA:** Get away from her. Now!

**HANNISHWOMANA:** Aaagggh! Aaaaaaaaaggghhh!

**THANCRED:** Nooo! Nooooooooo!

**YSHTOLA:** ...Damn it. We've got to kill them before it spreads!

**HANNISHMANA:** We'll handle this. See the townspeople to safety!

**HANNISHBOYA:** Run! As fast as you can!

**AWAHEEN:** Ah! Aaah...aaah...no! Gaaaaaaghhh! Faaa...grrraaaaaaghhh!

**HANNISHMANA:**       Vrtra... Our people... You must save them!

**GRAHATIA:** My son...he...he... The satrap!

**HANNISHMANA:** Enough! You must run, for their sake and your own!

**GRAHATIA:**  

**THANCRED:** Yes. You will survive. You must.   Be strong, my friends! Fear not, for we will defeat these abominations! Brave men and women of the Radiant Host! Lend Y'shtola and Thancred your aid! Let not a single beast escape! The rest of you, flee this place! Carry the wounded if you must! Head indoors, or underground! Above all, stay calm. No beasts will follow you─we will see to that.

**MATSYA:** Alphinaud! Alisaie! Leave the city to us, and make for Palaka's Stand at once! Matsya, show my friends to the village. I promise you─they're more capable than the Host's finest.

**GRAHATIA:** R-Right!

**SYSTEM:** Go with them, will you? We will save these people─as many as we can!

**ESTINIEN:** Meanwhile, in the skies above Thavnair─

**VRITRA:** No more enemies to trouble us here... ...It's me. How fare you below? ...Understood. I will inform Vrtra. Chaos and panic sweep Radz-at-Han, and many more have succumbed to the transformations. Amidst the fray, Ahewann fell...protecting a grief-stricken father.

**ESTINIEN:**  

**VRITRA:** My friends fight alongside your Radiant Host to secure the capital. Beasts have been sighted in Palaka's Stand as well. We have divided our forces in hopes of quelling the threat there. Of small solace is that we now know what triggers the transformation. As my companions tell it...

**ESTINIEN:** So it is the very fear and despair in their hearts which inflict this abhorrent punishment upon them... ...A nightmare from which my children will never awake. O capricious and cruel fate─they are undeserving of such condemnation...

**VRITRA:** Will you wallow in sorrow or rise to the occasion? Radz-at-Han is leaderless. Before he passed, Ahewann sought to reveal the truth to his people. Honor his wishes.

**ESTINIEN:** To what end? To breed a new conflict between dragon and man? These claws could reduce thee to shreds with a touch. These jaws, crush thy bones to dust. Only through my proxy could I walk with my children. Without him, I am a bringer of fear─no different from the beasts which beleaguer them.

**VRITRA:** Perhaps so... Only in death were Hraesvelgr and Shiva united. Indeed, whenever man and dragon have come together, death has ever been the inevitable result. 'Twas our fear of your kind that sparked a nigh-endless war. Fear and hate of which Nidhogg drank deep as he laid waste to my homeland. And in turn I took my revenge on his brood. Blood for blood; pain for pain. I thought nothing of theirs─only of mine. And yet...were the chasm between us too vast and too deep, Hraesvelgr would not have borne Ysayle to battle and our rescue. He would have never entrusted a mortal champion with one of his eyes, and the Dragonsong War would still rage on. And I would still wage a never-ending war of violence and vengeance, the future of our star be damned. I cannot speak for Ahewann's greater goals. Yet I know that he served you─served your people─long and true. In this time of unprecedented crisis, he turned to you. You could do worse than to place your trust in him. It will not be easy, but the future of Radz-at-Han hangs in the balance. We have company!

**ESTINIEN:** I am ready.

**ALPHINAUD:** The hour is come, Vrtra. It's all or nothing!

**MATSYA:** Courage, friend. The pain will pass.

**ALISAIE:** Has anyone seen Mehvan? Where could she be...?

**ALPHINAUD:** We've dealt with all the blasphemies...and made certain no villagers are still in hiding.

**PALAKASMAN:** Good work. We've otherwise tended to the wounded as best we can.

**PALAKASWOMANA:** What will become of us?

**PALAKASMAN:** Help is on the way, surely. We may have to abandon our homes now, but we will return. Someday.

**PALAKASWOMANA:** But where can we go? Is anywhere even safe?

**PALAKASWOMANB:** That, I cannot say...

**ALISAIE:** Well, I can. Nowhere's safe! Run all you like, but there's no escaping these things! And even if I could...it's too late for my family!  

**MATSYA:** This isn't good. The more they dwell on the tragedy, the more likely we are to lose them, too...

**PALAKASWOMANA:** My friends! This...this is a place of worship! Should your heart quake with sadness, cast your mind to the heavens and remember. Remember the teachings of the old gods. Did they not implore us to stand fast when waves of sorrow break against our shores?

**PALAKASOLDMAN:** Know this, my children. There is more ugliness than beauty in this world. To live is to suffer. To drink of calamity and drown in anguish. To toil and be tested, always and ever.

**PALAKASMAN:** 'Tis a perilous path you walk. Death lurks in the dark, and is the sole promise that awaits at journey's end. You will tremble with terror. You will weep tears of anger and despair...

**PALAKASWOMANB:** ...But do not avert your eyes. See your life for what it is. Then will you see how the hardships make you strong.

**PALAKASOLDMAN:** Every doubt reforged as scales for your armor. Every agony to temper your blade...

**ALPHINAUD:** Thank you, lad. We'd almost forgotten who we are. My undying gratitude to you as well, my friends. You were searching for Mehvan, no? We must return home. I pray you help the boy find his friend.

**ALISAIE:** Gladly. We dispatched what beasts we could, but the roads are still dangerous. Stay together, and go in safety.

**MATSYA:** That was very impressive, what you did back there. Those words seemed to resonate with your people.

**ALISAIE:** They should. They were the first spoken unto our ancestors by the divinity of legend. I'm easily upset, and fish are wont to flee a temperamental hand. So I recite the teachings, over and over, to calm myself.

**MATSYA:** They're lovely and inspiring to hear. Though I imagine they were born of great misfortune.

**ALPHINAUD:** They are born of life. There's as much bad as good in it─more, many would attest. All the more reason to appreciate the good when you can.

**HYDAELYN:** I won't argue with that.

**ALISAIE:** (-Hydaelyn-)In darkness seek joy. Surrender not to sadness, and see beyond despair. Walk free, and bear the light for others to follow.

**MATSYA:** And with that, let us see if we can't find Mehvan. Did you see!? That beast was chasing someone!

**MEHVAN:** That's her... No, I'm...I'm sure of it! Mehvan!

**ALISAIE:** Don't, please!  

**MEHVAN:**  

**MATSYA:**  

**ALISAIE:** No...gods have mercy!

**ALPHINAUD:** She's so cold, Alphinaud...

**ALISAIE:** The child is alert, and I see no wounds. And yet, she grows weaker... My spells can do no more. What she needs is a change of clothes and a warm bed. We must hurry back! Not now...!

**ALPHINAUD:** Matsya, take the child!

**MATSYA:** Godsdammit, it appears we've made enough noise to be heard for malms around. More will be upon us ere long. We make our stand here. Matsya, can you take her back to the village?

**ALISAIE:** Th-The child? All...all by myself!? You can't be serious!

**MATSYA:** The beasts will follow you home unless we stop them here─and so we shall. Be strong, Matsya! Her life is in your hands!

**ALISAIE:** R-Right! I...I can do it!

**MATSYA:** I know you can! We'll keep them busy, Matsya. Go─quickly!

**VRITRA:** <huff> <puff>  Steady... You know the way... No, no! Not you, too... Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid... To live is to suffer. To drink of calamity... 'Tis a perilous path... Death...lurks in the dark... Aie! N-No! I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! Uwaaaaaah! Do not avert your eyes. See...see your life for what it is... See how the hardships make you strong. Every doubt reforged... Every...agony... Ah─! Huh? The divinity...?

**MATSYA:** ...Nay. But one who would deliver thee just the same.

**ESTINIEN:** Please... You must save the child! She is all that remains of Mehvan and Qerasaf. Please!

**VRITRA:** Well, well. Seems the babe's taken a liking to you.

**ESTINIEN:** Thou art strong, little one. Let us convey thee to thy home.

**ALISAIE:** Phew... I spied our friends as we flew in...they appeared to be holding their own against the horde.

**000:** Right. That's the last of them. We should hurry and find Matsya...

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? I have a feeling he'll be fine. He had help. From on high.

**ESTINIEN:** Really? How can you be so sure? What, like divine aid...?

**ALPHINAUD:** A fine battle it must have been. Shame I missed it.

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien! It was you who came to Matsya's aid?

**ALPHINAUD:** I was only along for the ride─Vrtra was the one who saw the boy was in need. The two are headed back to the village.

**ESTINIEN:** Where the wyrm will honor Ahewann's wishes and finally reveal himself to his people...

**ALISAIE:** Perhaps so. Will you go and join them?

**HANNISHMANB:** There's something I need to do first. Mehvan gave her life so that her child might live. She deserves better than to be left to drift alone. She deserves to be laid to rest beside her husband, at least. Will you help me?

**VARSHAHN:** Look! Someone's coming!

**HANNISHMANB:** People of Radz–at–Han. It warms my heart to see so many brave, resilient souls before me. Today, I would share with you a great revelation. But before I do, I must make a humble request... Do not be alarmed, nor avert your eyes. See the one I unveil for who he is, and know that he means you no harm.

**VARSHAHN:** Very well. I daresay it can't be worse than the horrors we've already seen.

**HANNISHOLDWOMANB:** ...Many thanks.

**HANNISHBOYB:** A dragon!

**VRITRA:** Wow!

**GRAHATIA:** People of Radz–at–Han. I am Vrtra, and for years uncounted hath this isle served as mine abode. 'Tis as the satrap's ally I am known. Today, I would reveal the truth unto you.

**HANNISHMANB:** Let us hope they accept him.

**HANNISHBOYB:** If I am hearing this right, you were the satrap all along!?

**VRITRA:** Varshahn─ I mean, Master Vrtra... D-Does your divine eye really see all?

**HANNISHOLDWOMANB:** ...Nay, child. While mine eye hath borne witness to the whole of our nation's history, to its future I am blind as thee. Countrymen. Calamity the likes of which we have never known is come to Thavnair. Our home. Friends and loved ones have been taken from us. I, too, have lost my closest confidant. Ahewann loved this land, and served it with dignity till his dying breath. A nobler satrap there will never be. For so long, I lacked the courage to face you. I will not easily earn your trust─this I know. And yet, I cannot sit idly by and abandon Radz–at–Han to her fate. A font of boundless vibrancy, this jewel of the ocean. Since time immemorial hath she glittered with every color imaginable. To this dragon slumbering in his dark lair, 'twas a mesmerizing sight─and one that brought no end of joy to my heart. This calamity hath stolen too much from you already. Yet so long as you live, the light of Radz-at-Han will never be extinguished. I pray you let me watch over it...over you. And lend me your strength, that we might face this trial and those to come as one.

**ALPHINAUD:** I do not know you, dragon. But I thank you for speaking the truth to us. As divinities both Manusya and Mrga once joined together, so too do I believe that, hand in hand, we can overcome this ordeal, and welcome an era of peace.

**ESTINIEN:** ...A sight that would have surely brought a smile to Ysayle's face.

**FOURCHENAULT:** ...Indeed.

**ALISAIE:** Excuse me, but I must speak with the satrap at once.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Father!

**VRITRA:** You have suffered dearly of late. Yet you must endeavor to look beyond these losses to the future you yet have. On behalf of the Forum of Sharlayan, I come with a proposal by which you, the people of Radz-at-Han, might be saved. I say again, I must speak with your satrap. I beseech you─take me to him with all possible haste.

**FOURCHENAULT:** I am satrap here. Speak thy proposal. All present shall hear and judge.

**HANNISHMANB:** If I have given offense, then I apologize. First, allow me to share with you what knowledge we have of the phenomenon responsible for your woes: the Final Days. 'Tis an affliction of stagnancy and rot sown into the currents of the star. Though the first prominent manifestation was here in Thavnair, it will invariably spread to every corner of the world. The Forum was forewarned of this apocalypse several centuries ago. Thenceforth, my predecessors sought to prepare for the end times in the only conceivable fashion: by securing a means of escape.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Escape the star? What madness is this!?

**VRITRA:** 'Tis by no means madness. With the coming of the Seventh Umbral Calamity, the true nature of the red moon Dalamud was revealed─that it was an artificial construct of ancient Allag. But what of the silver moon? This celestial satellite is yet another technological marvel fashioned and maintained by ancient allies. A ship that will sail the heavens and deliver our people from destruction. And by our people, I speak not only of Sharlayan. We mean to save every man, woman, and child it is within our power to save. Including you, our dear friends of Radz–at–Han. Recent events necessitate adjustments be made, and quickly, but we can and will escort you safely to the moon.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Long has thy Forum been allies to Thavnair. I trust thou dost not extend this offer lightly. Yet I wonder...is this truly the way? Is there a future to be built for us beyond this star our father deemed the last bastion of hope?

**VRITRA:** It is for that very reason I come before you and your people. To answer any and all of your questions. To offer my assurances and allay your fears. ...Though if you wish the best for your people, I advise you to render your decision swiftly.

**HANNISHBOYB:** Show our friends to Meghaduta. They are to be received as honored guests. Worry not. Whatever decision is reached, your paths shall be yours to decide. Until then, heed the warning of these brave heroes─guard your hearts against fear and despair, for it is within such fertile soil that the seeds of blasphemy find purchase. Remain calm and attend to your daily tasks. I shall return anon.

**NIDHANA:** We'll do as you say, Master Vrtra. We believe in you!

**ALISAIE:** Oh, you're still here! What a relief!

**NIDHANA:** Nidhana? What's the matter? Has something happened at Palaka's Stand?

**YSHTOLA:** Oh, no! Not that I know of. I'd just hoped to hear your thoughts on a theory of mine. All who undergo the transformation are drained of their aether, yes? What is it, then, that gives these beasts the strength to carry on as they do? Logically, they must be drawing upon an alternate form of vital energy. That put me in mind of our earlier conversation, when I tried to explain the essence which many confuse with aether.

**NIDHANA:** Akasa... Yes, I remember. The unseen gift bestowed from on high... An energy influenced solely by emotion!

**YSHTOLA:** Yes, yes. In this instance, negative ones set akasa into motion, thereby infusing the beasts with vitality. I posit this is the mechanism by which the beasts are born and sustained. Ah─do you still have that flower? If we accept that it once shone bright by drawing upon akasa influenced by the thoughts of those nearby... Then fear, terror, despair─negative emotions so powerful as to suffocate it─permeated the air in this place. You must be very careful. The forces which drive the Final Days may be beyond our ability to perceive. Sorry...I didn't mean to scare you like that. At any rate, I will continue my research into akasa. Do temper your expectations, however. There are sadly few detailed studies upon which I may draw.

**NIDHANA:** Formulating a new theory, as you have, is itself no small feat. I wish you well in your endeavors, and pray you take care.

**YSHTOLA:** Thank you. You stay safe as well, yes? Till next we meet─and we will meet again!

**ALPHINAUD:** So blasphemies now plague all the realm...

**THANCRED:** It will only get worse, if what Father said is true. As it did in Amaurot...

**ESTINIEN:** If that's our model, then shouldn't we expect the effects to grow more severe as it feeds off its own spread? As if people transforming into those monstrosities wasn't bad enough, if the flora and fauna─if the land itself turned against us...

**MIHLEEL:** ...No one would survive.

**ALISAIE:** Here's your order, friend. May you find comfort in these dark times.

**YSHTOLA:** Where do we go from here? If there's one thing we've learned, fighting blindly and simply reacting to what comes will accomplish nothing. We must find a solution that addresses the fundamental cause. Before our strength is exhausted. Before this crisis spirals out of control! Is there something...anything we've overlooked?

**WATCHEROFMOON:** If there is an answer, Hydaelyn Herself will have it. 'Twas She who bound Zodiark and forestalled the Final Days. Alas, we have heard naught from Her since the Tower of Babil. Whether She cannot or will not speak, I can only speculate... Even the flower She gave us is no more...

**YSHTOLA:** In our time, we called it “Elpis”... You would do well to remember the name.

**ALPHINAUD:** So advised the watcher...but what could be the significance of that name? It is entirely unfamiliar to me.

**YSHTOLA:** To me as well. It meant something to the ancients, though. “In *our* time...”

**ALISAIE:** Most surely. Yet I do not recall a single mention of it in the records of Anyder.

**GRAHATIA:** Another dead end, and quite literally. It's not as if there are any ancients living we could go and ask...

**000:** Not alive as such...but not quite dead... ...Elidibus. I sealed him in the white auracite of the Crystal Tower, back on the First. Contained within that reservoir of aether that maintains it─aether that is returned little by little to the sea...naught may remain of his soul. However, if part of it lingers...we might be able to speak with him there. I─no, we can no longer make that journey. But you, my friend, still can.

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? It's worth a try. It would be an opportunity to look in on the others as well. If there is truly no other way...

**THANCRED:** Yes, we can but act and hope for the best! Thank you, my friend. That would mean much to me. I understand your trepidation, but there is merit in making the journey regardless. You could see with your own eyes whether the First, too, faces its Final Days.

**ALISAIE:** If nothing else, should we learn the First is safe, we'll have that much more reason to keep fighting the good fight. That said...the odds are not in our favor, to say the least. Which is why we're fortunate to have Urianger up there on the moon, working hard to make all the necessary preparations for our departure, should it come to it.

**YSHTOLA:** ...And why we have nothing to lose by staying the course till the last instant!

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. To the last, let us all do what we can. I will consult with Master Matoya and see if she knows of a way to reach Hydaelyn from the aetherial sea.

**ESTINIEN:** And I will visit the nations' leaders and attempt to ascertain how far the Final Days have progressed elsewhere.

**ALPHINAUD:** Keep me abreast of your findings. I can seek out and slay the worst of the immediate threats, if only to slow the spread.

**EMETSELCH:** Unease, terror, despair... Try as we might to suppress them, these emotions will return to harry us time and time again. But when they do, remember this... Your friends and loved ones are out there, somewhere, sharing in your struggle. You are not alone.

**ELIDIBUS:** (-Allagan Console-)Biometric authentication complete. Please state your business. (-Allagan Console-)Acknowledged. Reinitializing Syrcus Tower systems. Searching for “Elidibus” entity... (-Allagan Console-)Target located in subterranean core power accumulator. Projecting image.

**000:** My home... My friends... No more than a dream... You... Why have you awakened me? I no longer sense those places beyond...or Lord Zodiark. You must explain all. So. He is fallen, and my brethren's souls returned to the star... The doom we sacrificed so much to prevent is come again. Old burdens, now yours to bear. But...if this is Fandaniel's design, then I, as Elidibus, have a duty to fulfill. Your unsolicited act has restored to me some few memories of the Convocation. Such knowledge as I have, I will share.

**ELIDIBUS:** What will you say? Thank you. I'm sorry...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** I do this not for you. I merely perform my duty, as I have ever done. Why apologize for receiving a favor of the defeated? If it sits ill, consider it payment for freeing Lord Zodiark from servitude. Where to begin... Ah. The end. Your understanding of what caused the Final Days is consistent with our own. The decay first took root where the currents were weakest. Yes...a conclusion drawn by him. Fandaniel. Not the him of here and now, but as I knew him. Long, long ago... Having shed light upon the phenomenon, he dedicated himself to devising a countermeasure. Were it not for his knowledge of the celestial, we would never have made the connection─and thence forestalled the Final Days. And though he inherited that noble soul...how different, this last incarnation. So consumed by self-loathing and hate. ...Elpis? Yes...the name is familiar to me. Yet I know it not as a flower, but a place. A testing facility for determining which of our creations were fit to be released into the world. Many worked there. And before joining the Convocation and assuming the title of Fandaniel, he was their chief... He...was Hermes... That...is all I know. The crystals tell little of the lives the Fourteen led prior to their induction. Elpis itself would tell even less. Nary a ruin has survived─ Wait... I saw you there. In Elpis. No...I did not...but I did. I did. A lingering trace of impossibility... And a truth...that fills my heart... My memories remain clouded, I fear. However...they have revealed to me one possible course. You must travel to Elpis─to the time when Hermes served as its chief. In glimpsing the Exarch's memories, not only did I make his summoning magick mine own─I also mastered the workings of this tower. Which, having absorbed my empowered essence, now harbors an abundance of energy. As such, I believe I can deliver you unto the past. Unto that place and that precise moment. Given the eons that must be traversed, the gateway will not be fully formed. Your form will be less tangible still than those Warriors of Light I had summoned. In all likelihood, none will be able to see or hear you. Yet even should you manage to interact with others, you will be unable to effect meaningful change. For the reality you wish to save─the reality to which you must return─exists as a result of the Final Days. You cannot reshape the past to undo the tragedies of the present. Cannot unmake the sorrow and suffering fated to come. In full knowledge of this, will you still entrust your life to your foe and make the journey? Very well. I shall cast you unto the river of time. Let this be my final act. You must input the commands. I no longer have the authority. First, you must reconfigure the systems, that the tower's aether may be channeled for the magick... The preparations are complete. The gateway will soon open. Return at once to the Ocular. All appears to be in order. The aether flows unimpeded. The magick should consume every last mote of my essence. Why are you surprised? Did I not say that this will be my final act? Lord Zodiark is no more. There is nothing for me here. The ones I love and long to see again are waiting. In that promised land, beyond memory and dream... Now go, Warrior of Light. Go...and do not look back. Well, Hydaelyn. I take my leave of You. Yours is the mantle of the last of us. May You have...the joy of it. The burden...and the solitude. It falls to You now─You and Your champion─to save our star.

**PROPYLAIONSTAFF:** (-???-)And here we are. Elpis.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Well, well, how rare to receive you in person. To what do we owe the honor?

**PROPYLAIONSTAFF:** (-Familiar Stranger-)Oh, just a few odd tasks. We'll be here a while.

**EMETSELCH:** You're welcome to stay as long as you see fit, of course. As a matter of procedure, however, I must ask that you kindly remove your masks.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Familiar Voice-)Come now, is this truly necessary? Surely you can tell who we are...

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)Who you are, perhaps, but I am far less infamous. Regardless, if we do not follow protocol, 'tis our hosts who would be held accountable. So please, do favor us with your handsome face.

**PROPYLAIONSTAFF:** No subtitles, report if displayed. (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)...Satisfied?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** I thank you for your cooperation. You are free to go about your business.

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)By the by...you see it too, yes?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)I haven't the foggiest what you're talking about.

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)Hmm? That's odd. (-Familiar Stranger-)It's right here. A bit thin in the aether, but there's no mistaking it─the color of its soul is almost identical to Azem's. (-Familiar Stranger-)Do you suppose he created it? Rather unusual for a familiar to have a soul, though... (-Familiar Stranger-)Do you suppose she created it? Rather unusual for a familiar to have a soul, though...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)Don't ask me. All I know is that it's trouble─doubly so if it's her spitting image. (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)So let's leave it be. Come, now.

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)It's trying to say something...but it's literally too intangible to form words. (-Familiar Stranger-)Why don't you give it some aether? Spare a snifter of your bounteous reserves.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)Who do you take me for?

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)Why, a dear friend, of course! One who wouldn't let acts of kindness─such as my accompanying him on errands to far-flung outposts─go unrewarded.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** No subtitles, report if displayed. (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)I suggest you close your eyes, or this may be...unpleasant. (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)You may open your eyes.

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)Still a touch small, don't you think?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)The size befits its proportions. Besides, bigger is not necessarily better.

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)I will defer to your experience. (-Familiar Stranger-)Quite large, don't you think?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)The size befits its proportions. Though I personally wouldn't be averse to smaller.

**EMETSELCH:** (-Familiar Stranger-)No, no, this will suffice, I'm sure. (-Familiar Stranger-)Oh, you even adjusted its size.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Man with a Familiar Voice-)The better to indulge your whim. This way it will be easier to communicate.

**000:** (-Familiar Stranger-)How very thoughtful of you. And may I applaud your artful reinforcement. Without further ado, then... Greetings! I am Hythlodaeus, chief of the Bureau of the Architect. Sulking beside me is the most honorable Emet-Selch of the Convocation of Fourteen. And how might we address you, my new friend? A fine name. And I'm pleased to see you understand our words. So tell us, whence have you come? The thinness of your essence suggests you weren't created here... You do not know...or cannot say? Hmm. Allow me to ask a different question, then. What brings you here?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** What will you say? I seek a man named Hermes. I want to learn about Elpis.

**EMETSELCH:** Well now, the same as us... Perhaps Azem wished to come too, but had to settle for a familiar.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** If she truly wished to be here, then she would be.

**EMETSELCH:** Right you are... My apologies if we've given offense. The two of us can discern the color of souls, you see, and yours happens to resemble that of a friend. And with your purpose matching our own besides, we jumped to a hasty conclusion. We are here to speak with Hermes, the chief overseer of this facility, which we also intend to tour in order to gain greater insight into the man's work. “We,” I say, though this is Emet-Selch's charge. I am here only to serve as his guide. And I should be happy to serve as yours as well─by way of an apology for the misunderstanding.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Wait, are you suggesting that we bring it along on official business? This thing we know next to nothing about?

**VENAS:** If you harbor suspicions, better to keep it close than leave it to its own devices, wouldn't you agree? Besides, having a mysterious life-form in tow is the norm rather than the exception here. Welcome, my friends, to the testing ground of creation at heavens' edge: Elpis!

**METEION:** (-???-)This presence...

**EMETSELCH:** (-???-)Hermes! Visitors─we have visitors!

**HERMES:** What secrets are you hiding, I wonder...

**METEION:** You are...?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** No subtitles, report if displayed. No subtitles, report if displayed. (-Bewinged Girl-)Different! You're different too! (-Bewinged Girl-)You and me. We're alike. Friends. I want to be─ (-Bewinged Girl-)Wait... Please...wait... (-Bewinged Girl-)Greetings and salutations! Can you hear me? (-Bewinged Girl-)Do not be alarmed─I mean you no harm. I wish only to hear your words, share your feelings, and know your thoughts. (-Bewinged Girl-)May we please be friends? (-Bewinged Girl-)May we please...be friends!

**HERMES:** Ah, I see you found him.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Hythlodaeus... It's been a while. Too long, I think.

**HERMES:** Too long indeed for close collaborators. On this blessed occasion, I bring not only myself, but others who long to speak with you.

**EMETSELCH:** You are of the Convocation.

**HERMES:** Emet-Selch, at your service. Do I have the honor of addressing Hermes, chief overseer of Elpis?

**EMETSELCH:** You do. You have traveled far for it.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Given your facility's purpose, its remote location is something of a necessity. Would that I didn't have to rely upon a guide...

**HERMES:** You wound me. Have I not ever been an attentive and helpful friend? But moving along to more agreeable company, this one we chanced to... ...Well, you certainly have her attention. Is she one of yours, Hermes?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Her name is Meteion. It means shooting star.

**HERMES:** If I may make an observation, her aether is terribly thin. I fear she might dissipate at any moment. Nor do I believe you've made a submission to the bureau. I would remember such a concept if you had.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** I haven't, as you say. I judged it too early. She's a pet project of mine─still undergoing preliminary testing. But rest assured that I will attend in person ere long.

**EMETSELCH:** Very well. Being an authority on flying life-forms, I appreciate that you are exacting in your work. I shall look forward to your submission.

**HERMES:** If we have finished with the perfunctory chitchat, I would discuss official matters. By my coming, I trust you already anticipate the subject.

**METEION:** I have an inkling, yes. Please wait at the main building yonder. I shall join you as soon as I've returned these creatures to their homes. No subtitles, report if displayed.

**HERMES:** What's wrong, Hermes?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** An ambystoma is missing...

**EMETSELCH:** Hm, I may have found it. A creature with the selfsame aether as those there, nestled in the boughs of a tree outside the grounds.

**HERMES:** You're saying they can climb? With their sorry excuses for limbs?

**METEION:** The “fashion” has been to imbue aquatic creatures with the power of flight, ever since the Words of Mitron created a sky-swimming fish... The ambystomas too can fly, if only slightly, and they could conceivably climb a tree. Whether they can come down safely, however... Excuse me.

**EMETSELCH:** I'll help too!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** And what are we supposed to do with this lot?

**EMETSELCH:** May I suggest we split up? If you would be so good as to assist Hermes, Emet-Selch and I shall keep an eye on these adorable creations in the meantime.

**000:** This appears to be the place. And here is where we part ways. We will be discussing highly sensitive affairs. Only a select few may be privy to such knowledge, and that does not include someone who cannot or will not divulge their origins. What? Will I have to remove you by force?

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? I have important things to say to him as well. There are reasons I cannot speak freely.

**HERMES:** Yes, I'm sure your business with Hermes is quite pressing. You may speak with him to your heart's content─after ours is concluded. Let's hear them, then. These reasons of yours. Who knows─if I deem your mysterious cause worthy, I may even be inclined to offer my assistance.

**EMETSELCH:** I do not object to his attendance. I do not object to her attendance.

**HERMES:** Hermes... This is highly irregular.

**EMETSELCH:** Perhaps, but I believe she can be trusted. Meteion would not have taken to her so quickly otherwise. Moreover...the presence of a third party may help me to maintain composure.

**HERMES:** No subtitles, report if displayed. As you wish, then. Behave yourself, do you hear?

**EMETSELCH:** So, it's finally happened, then.

**HERMES:** Aye. Fandaniel has declared his intention to step down, and named you as his preferred successor. In recognition of your knowledge and your works, the Convocation is giving the recommendation due consideration. As one who does not know you personally, I am to use my impartial eye to take your measure. And above all else, to ascertain your disposition towards the invitation. I understand that you and Fandaniel are close. He himself was once chief overseer of Elpis, after all. I should not be surprised if you knew before anyone else that he wished to relinquish his office.

**EMETSELCH:** I did... He told me that, when he fulfilled his purpose, he wished to pass the torch to me.

**HERMES:** A torch you seem none too pleased to accept. Are you so averse to serving on the Convocation?

**EMETSELCH:** No, it's not that... For a humble researcher like myself to even be considered...is an honor beyond words. No, what troubles me─what I struggle to come to terms with─is the very fact that Fandaniel is stepping down. Does this not mean that he will return to the star?

**METEION:** Of his own volition, yes. Like so many others have before him.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Return to the star? Does that mean...die?

**EMETSELCH:** Well now, that's not a word I hear often... Is that what you say here in Elpis? Mankind is the life of Etheirys. Each of us a drop of blood flowing through its veins, bearing sustenance. In our finite time upon it, 'tis our duty to make it a better place, that all who call it home now and in future may abide in happiness. To that end, we have dedicated ourselves to the pursuit of enlightened creation. And by our efforts did we transform this once-untamed wilderness into the peaceful paradise you enjoy today. To return to the star whence we came is a privilege afforded to we who have so loved and nurtured it. A choice embraced by those who have lived their lives to the fullest, in service to our world. And when they depart upon this journey, it is beautiful. Always.

**HERMES:** The Fourteen are no exception. 'Tis believed no occasion is more felicitous than the fulfillment of one's duty. Our office becomes our lives, and to retire is to return. Or so the majority of us hold. Some few have elected to eschew custom. Mayhap you feel Fandaniel's deeds do not warrant his return. Yet you should know his accomplishments as well as any. During his time, he conceived of countless outstanding concepts. And channeling the wealth of experience he attained here in Elpis, he brought forth many new specimens.

**METEION:** I know of all this, I do... It's just...I cannot fathom why someone so great and wise, who could still do so much good, would want to end it all... Oh no, I've made her upset... Forgive me─I know I requested your presence. Might I trouble you to take Meteion outside? A change of scenery would do her good. Amazing, is it not? The ampelos─one of our newest subjects. So, how are we coming along?

**HERMES:** This place is Elpis! Those flowers, Elpis! Entelechies! Like me!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** They are a product of Elpis and so named for their birthplace. A happy accident born of the hands of a former researcher who loved beautiful blossoms. Unique for how they change color to reflect the emotional state of those nearby. Though be it here or elsewhere, they are seldom seen in any hue save purest white...

**HERMES:** Reflect the emotional state, you say? By what means do they achieve this?

**NIDHANA:** In creation, there exists an energy wholly apart from aether. One driven by emotions. In like manner to how we manipulate aether, this flower is subject to the influence of said energy. While it has no will of its own, it is sensitive to the prevailing emotion in the vicinity, and reacts by altering its color and vibrancy.

**HERMES:** (-Nidhana-)Akasa? It is one of the unseen energies defined by Hannish alchemical theory. Though a gross oversimplification, some describe it as an essence influenced by feelings.

**METEION:** Akasa... Though I'm not familiar with the term, your description suggests it is the selfsame energy. Dynamis, we call it. And those entities like the Elpis flower, that have the ability to interact with this energy, converting emotions into tangible phenomena... ...Are entelechies.

**HERMES:** That's me, that's me! An entelechy!

**EMETSELCH:** That you are, my dear. And no ordinary one at that, but the first possessed of free will.

**HERMES:** Wait. A form of energy other than aether? Dynamis? I've never heard of such a thing.

**EMETSELCH:** Hardly surprising. Dynamis cannot be seen, much less felt. And though its existence has long been theorized, we had no proof until the flower's serendipitous creation. What's more, dynamis is far weaker than aether. Under normal circumstances, its effects are drowned out by the latter. On account of which, beings comprised of and reliant upon aether, like you and I, are unable to make practical use of dynamis. 'Tis a truly esoteric thing, known to but a select few scholars.

**HERMES:** Intriguing... Then given the limitations you described, why create Meteion?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Our star, Etheirys, is especially rich in aether. So much so that its name is derived from it. However, when we consider all energy in existence, here and in the vast space beyond, dynamis may account for as much as sixty-eight point three percent. The more abundant form by far. Were we able to control it, we could open the door to limitless possibilities. 'Tis not unlike a gently flowing stream, unable to break through the dam of aether barring its path. But if we could imbue this stream with the vigor of a raging river... ...Not that I have such grand ambitions. Nay, I merely wished to create a being that could traverse the great expanse. The relative scarcity of aether beyond the bounds of this star was a concern, and so I looked to another source of energy by necessity.

**HERMES:** That being dynamis. No wonder her aether is so thin.

**METEION:** Precisely.

**000:** Yours is thin too. Like an entelechy. Like me. So...are we the same? Entelechies?

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? Sure, I don't see why I couldn't be one. Well, I *have* been known to transcend my limits with nothing but determination. If I'm thin, it's because Emet-Selch didn't do a proper job.

**HERMES:** I think not. Your nature remains a mystery, but ere I reinforced you, you appeared to be little more than a common familiar─and a faded one at that. That sounds more akin to the desperate flailings of a wild beast when facing imminent death. Well, aren't we ungrateful? Mayhap I should revert you to the pathetic, faded thing you were.

**EMETSELCH:** A deficit of aether alone does not an entelechy make. It would, however, make it easier for you to interact with dynamis. And limited though its influence may be, this quality could prove the difference between victory and defeat. You'd do well not to underestimate it. Oh dear, I'd forgotten about the poor fellow. You must excuse me a moment while I go and verify a few more things.

**HERMES:** No, no, no, you are not foisting this nonsense on me!

**METEION:** I'm given to understand you have the power to help the charybdis─and should be quite willing to do so. And so I appeal to your better nature, most benevolent Emet-Selch. Please teach it to fly!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Or else Hermes will transform! Right now!

**EMETSELCH:** Now, now, there's no need to go quite that far. Altruism is its own reward, as I'm sure he would agree.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Oh would he now? And who contrived to put me in this position, pray tell?

**METEION:** Nothing so devious. I merely suggested a possible course of action.

**EMETSELCH:** Please, Emet-Selch! Please!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** No subtitles, report if displayed. I did not come all this way to play nursemaid to your creations. I'd thank you to remember this favor...and let it be the last. I will aid it once it has taken to the air. It falls to you to shepherd it skyward.

**METEION:** Well, let's relax and enjoy the spectacle, shall we? You were wondering why Emet-Selch joined the Convocation. Truth be told, he wasn't the first choice for the office. I was─on the strength of my ability to see aether. But I declined the offer. For though my vision is exceptional, I am pedestrian in all other aspects. Worse, even. Quite abysmal when it comes to manipulating aether, for example. Couldn't transform even if I had a mind to do so. What good is the ability to perceive a problem if one cannot act to address it? Emet-Selch has no such shortcomings. He excels in vision and manipulation both─the latter to an extraordinary degree. If there is a mage more powerful, I do not know of them. Thus did I recommend him for the office in my stead. And I wasn't the only one. Far from it. Countless others vouched for his skill and character. People the world over, to whom he had previously lent a helping hand. Oh, how surprised he was. Claimed he hadn't done anything remarkable for anyone. Modest to a fault. He deserved every bit of acclaim he received. Yet he may well have gone unappreciated were it not for a mutual friend. A singular soul who can't help but involve herself in the business of others. Where she walks, excitement is certain to follow. Her antics irritate Emet-Selch to no end, but much of his grumbling stems from genuine concern. When our friend calls, he never fails to answer and lend his talents. And in the course of doing so, he himself came to be recognized and respected by those around him. They are truly remarkable individuals, and I'm proud to call them friends. To help them realize their dreams─this will be my greatest contribution to our world. And when they have fulfilled their respective purposes... So too shall I have fulfilled mine, and together we may return to the star. Look at me, spilling my innermost secrets. I can't seem to help it with you. I can only assume it is due to the color of your soul. I just don't understand how you can be so alike and yet so different.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Well done, my pet! Well done!

**METEION:** Ah yes, I daresay the charybdis will be fine hereon. Why don't you go and signal to Emet-Selch. Let him know that his arduous task is at an end.

**HERMES:** Hermes!

**METEION:** Oh... You were waiting for me.

**HERMES:** You've finished talking?

**METEION:** Yes. We've come to a decision. My thanks for keeping Meteion company. Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus have already retired to their rooms. There is a room for you too, if you would follow me.

**HERMES:** Wait! I want to show you something first.

**METEION:** Elpis flowers...?

**HERMES:** Go on!

**METEION:** No subtitles, report if displayed.

**HERMES:** You're not the only one, Hermes. Others feel sad too. You're not alone.

**000:** I see Meteion has shared much with you. May we talk a moment? I do not think it wrong that we live for the star. That we strive to make it a better place. And yet, in carrying out my duties here, there are times when I am plagued by doubt. Do you recall what Hythlodaeus said, when we first spoke of my nomination? Death is the privilege of those who have fulfilled their purpose. A choice they embrace of their own free will. And when they depart, it is always beautiful. Perhaps it is...but only for man. Creations that he deems useless are discarded with nary a second thought. Some scarcely born into the world. Afforded a handful of breaths before life and potential are abruptly extinguished. We make an effort to spare them the pain. But they sense what awaits. Rage in anguish and cower in fear...and it is *not* beautiful. Yet no one cares. No one. So fixated are we upon the duty that we do not pause to question the method. Pain and suffering... Confusion and despair... Writ plain in the eyes of those poor creatures. Yet no one sees. We turn a blind eye and carry on in blissful ignorance. Naught amiss, and always─always the blossoms shine pure and white. A contradiction so blatant I could scream. Want to scream. How can you all accept this...aberration!? Then I wonder...am *I* the aberration for thinking thus? And I am filled with dread... But now I know I'm not alone. Not the only one for whom the flowers weep. I won't ask what you thought as you kneeled beside the Elpis. Or if you only did it at Meteion's insistence. Nevertheless...I thank you. To know that you too have experienced suffering...is a comfort.

**HERMES:** What will you say? Glad I could be of service. Let's have no more brooding, eh? Oh, I could tell you *all* about suffering.

**METEION:** To so willingly lend an ear to ease my burden... You are a strange one. ...Indeed. Difficult though it may be, I must endeavor to be strong like you. Lest you misunderstand, I derive no pleasure from your pain. It's just...the fact that you are still here, in spite of your suffering, gives me heart. The stars in the heavens... Know you what they are? Though it is too far to tell, each glittering light could be a world not unlike Etheirys. A world filled with life. So many stars, so many lives... For us, there may be no higher purpose than to live for our world, but what of the other living beings out there? What is it that gives *their* lives meaning? That drives them day after day after day? To pose that question to our undiscovered cousins, I created beings of dynamis, who can traverse the vast emptiness between the stars. Meteion and her sisters. Aye, sisters. She has a great many of them, and they have already departed on their journey. Traveling to one star, and then the next, in search of life. As one might expect, exploration on such a grand scale is rife with difficulties, and thus far I've naught to show for it. But I have faith that we will make some manner of discovery ere long. And when we do, I should be glad to share our findings with you, in gratitude for your kindness. ...It's getting rather late. We had best find our beds. 'Twould not do for both of us to be sleep-deprived on the morrow. Come, Meteion! Let us head back.

**HERMES:** All right!

**EMETSELCH:** Now! Oh... Forgive me... Please forgive me... May you and your kin find peace... Wherever your souls may drift in the Underworld, may you find tranquil seas. Be not forgotten. In concept endure to reclaim form and one day live again. Serve not the star or any purpose save your own. Live again, if that be your desire. Hate, if that be your wont. We are worthy. But leave your suffering behind. Lay down your burdens. Be born anew. Fly high. Fly free.

**HERMES:** Join the Convocation, Hermes. You do not belong here.

**METEION:** Leave to replace another─to be replaced? It changes nothing! Tell me! Do you think it right that we sacrifice all these lives for the sake of the star? And when the star has reached perfection─what then? If all who are satisfied choose to die, shall we all die in satisfaction!? ...I do not know. Were I to take up the seat of Fandaniel, it would be tantamount to approving my predecessor's death. I do not know if it is right. And to be torn by such thoughts...I do not know if I am fit to represent mankind.

**HERMES:** Hermes! Please don't be angry... It hurts so...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Forgive me. If you would still consider me in spite of everything, I beg some time to gather my thoughts. Meanwhile, Hythlodaeus, I fear I must trouble you to attend to the others.

**HERMES:** 'Tis no trouble at all. Take as long as you require.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** And you, my friend. I pray you find that which you seek.

**EMETSELCH:** I expect we have some few matters to discuss. Shall we return to the Twelve Wonders for a time?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Aye...

**EMETSELCH:** I present to you Kallimelios Zephyros. Here you will find a number of testing facilities as well as the observation hub of Poieten Oikos. Right, then. Let's begin by─ ...Hm? Well, well, an oreias. How delightful.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** And what, pray tell, is that...?

**EMETSELCH:** Ah, that's a new species of shark. We approved the concept but a few days ago. Sharks are among the most popular sea creatures. Rare is the day when someone does not submit a new concept. At first, they were largely orthodox. Consideration given to such things as size and environmental impact. And then a whimsical someone thought to bestow it with flight. Another, superior intelligence. And then the floodgates burst. Concepts with multiple heads, or arms, or legs, or arms *and* legs...and so on and so forth. It was getting absurd. A part of me wanted to tell them to go away and find something else to create, but in the end, I couldn't deny their passion...and here we are.

**VENAS:** No subtitles, report if displayed.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** No subtitles, report if displayed. (-Familiar Woman-)That was too close... Are you unharmed? (-Familiar Woman-)Well now, if it isn't a pair of familiar faces...

**EMETSELCH:** Venat! That we should meet you here!

**VENAS:** As I mentioned earlier, the better part of the Convocation holds that when we retire is when we return to the star. Well, she is not among said majority. Even after stepping down, she carries on with her work. Venat is her name, and she is the previous Azem.

**EMETSELCH:** It has been a while, Hythlodaeus. You look well. Less so, Emet-Selch. I daresay the lines upon your brow have both deepened and doubled in number. A shame for one so young. You must make an effort to frown less often.

**VENAS:** Easier said than done thanks to your unruly successor.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** How is she, if I may ask?

**VENAS:** Incorrigible as ever. Rushed headlong into a volcano on the brink of eruption just the other day. I should be glad to share the tale in its entirety later, if you are so inclined.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** You know I am! Now then, you are...? I say...have you perchance come from the future? I do not believe we have ever met, yet I sense my magick upon you. Therefore if I wove the enchantment, I could only have done so at a later point in time.

**VENAS:** What manner of magick is this, if I may ask?

**000:** A traveler's ward, of course. It prevents the corruption of one's aether.

**VENAS:** What will you say? That sounds rather like the blessing of Light... Does it protect you from enthrallment by primals, by any chance?

**EMETSELCH:** I see you are not ignorant to its presence. And while there are many protective spells, the one you bear is unmistakably mine. ...Primals, you say? I'm not familiar with such beings, but if they “enthrall” by warping the balance of aether, then yes─the magick would afford you a measure of protection. I gather from your question that you are not ignorant to its presence.

**VENAS:** Hold on─from the future? That's absurd.

**ELIDIBUS:** What is it? Are you unable to speak of the matter?

**VENAS:** The reality to which you must return exists as a result of the Final Days. You cannot reshape the past to undo the tragedies of the present.

**EMETSELCH:** So, your actions here will not change your history...but they may yet affect the course of ours... How very exciting. I'm quite fond of delving into the unknown─and there's naught more unknown than the future. Until a moment finally arrives, we cannot know for certain what will come to pass─regardless of our supposed foreknowledge. So you needn't worry for us. More importantly, that you should go to such great lengths as to travel unto the past bespeaks the gravity of your quest. Will you not reveal it to us? Mayhap we can be of aid to your cause.

**VENAS:** No subtitles, report if displayed. If this is true, then you've been keeping quite the secret to yourself. As a representative of the Convocation, I will hear it all. Your identity, purpose─everything.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Why don't we move to a place more conducive to calm conversation. I've been working here for some days now at an old friend's behest. If it is agreeable, we may make use of my accommodation at Poieten Oikos. We were meant to meet, I am certain of it. Else I wouldn't have marked you so clearly and sent you unto myself in the past. It's precisely the sort of mischief I would get up to─and quite inspired, if I do say so myself.

**VENAS:** A wonderful aroma... I feel more relaxed already.

**000:** Would that I had sweetmeats to offer, but I travel light out of habit. There's plenty of hot water, though, so please have as much tea as you like. Now then...will you tell us your tale?

**EMETSELCH:** In the future I came from... A calamity called the Final Days has befallen the world. The world has been sundered...broken into shards. Mankind is being forced to flee the star.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Why don't you start from the beginning? Preposterous. Utterly preposterous.

**VENAS:** While not the words I would have chosen, I too have my doubts. Much of it borders on the incredulous. What of you, Venat?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Not knowing the precise details of the first Final Days, 'tis difficult to determine the veracity of the tale. Supposing it is all true, I must ask myself why I would do what I did. Why would I feel I had no recourse but to oppose the Fourteen and create this Hydaelyn... Circumstances change, of course, but it would not have been an easy decision regardless. No, there must have been a reason. One compelling enough to force me to take such drastic measures. Then there is the Elpis flower, which I said would serve as a guide. That it's of import to your mission is plain, but your presence here leads me to believe that this place also holds significance. But what could it be? What are we meant to accomplish?

**VENAS:** Might it not be simply thus? In the future whence he came, the Final Days could not be averted. Mankind has no choice but to flee the star. In the future whence she came, the Final Days could not be averted. Mankind has no choice but to flee the star. By alerting us to that eventuality, perhaps you wished to pave the way for other futures.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Theoretically speaking, it is a possibility. Yet if that were my primary objective, I see no reason to guide our friend to Elpis specifically. The Capitol in Amaurot, or even my own home would be more logical destinations.

**VENAS:** True, true... I note also that Hydaelyn did not specify a point in time to which he must return. True, true... I note also that Hydaelyn did not specify a point in time to which she must return. By this, it may be inferred that it was not critical that we should meet.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Alternately, She had reason to believe that our paths would converge, coincidental though it may seem.

**VENAS:** This is quite a puzzle, and we do not have all the pieces...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Hardly any. But we do have one immutable fact. If the Final Days are indeed as described, they will bring death to all that I hold dear. Yet despite being afforded long years of preparation, the only provisions I could make were...for flight? Nay, my first and foremost endeavor would be to find a way to forestall the coming doom.

**VENAS:** Given that even the Fourteen failed, mayhap you deemed it impossible.

**EMETSELCH:** Nothing is impossible. This, I have always believed. And if Hydaelyn is indeed me, She would believe the same.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Listen to yourself. Are you seriously entertaining the notion that you are a messianic figure in some far-fetched tale? Well, I will not. I refuse to accept that our world could be undone by some unforeseen calamity. I also take offense to my portrayal as a megalomaniacal madman. To sacrifice oneself for the star is a noble act, and I would hold those who gave themselves to this Zodiark in the highest esteem. Yet you claim I recreated Amaurot and populated it with phantoms of our people. A bizarre indulgence that would be insulting to their memory. Worse still, I even *invited* you there─literally invited my own downfall. Why would I do something so idiotic and inexplicable? Now, I will allow that the hypothetical task of restoring our world would be daunting in the extreme. The thought of having to bear such a burden for a thousand *thousand* lives horrifies me. But I would never forsake my duty! I would never forsake my brethren! You do not know me! I've had my fill of your fiction. I will return to my duty...and you will not bother me again.

**VENAS:** Emet-Selch! Wait!

**000:** You've seen much of Elpis already. If you have any observations to share, I should like to hear them.

**VENAS:** What will you say? Dynamis is key to all of this. Hermes and Meteion are somehow involved. I'm still trying to make sense of it all...

**000:** Ah yes, the energy distinct from aether. Though not my field, I have a basic understanding of dynamis. And you say Hermes researched the phenomenon in the course of creating Meteion... Yes, I believe this warrants further investigation. Hermes and his creation Meteion, you say? If dynamis is the selfsame energy as akasa, as it likely seems, then those two may well be at the center of the calamity to come. This warrants further investigation. I see. Then for now, it might be best that we follow your lead and investigate he who will become Fandaniel. And if dynamis is the selfsame energy as akasa, as it likely seems, we would do well to learn more about it. With that settled, 'tis time for action. The missing pieces of the puzzle are here, I'm certain of it. And when you find them, the picture my future self has painted will be complete, and you will have your answer. Suffice it to say I will aid you in your quest. Have faith. If Emet-Selch is the man Azem described to me, we've not seen the last of him. A delightful breeze...and a breathtaking view. What is it like in the future? Is the world still a beautiful place?

**VENAS:** What will you say? As beautiful as ever. Some parts, yes. Others...not so much. It's more beautiful here.

**GALENE:** I swear, I could hear the glimmer in your eyes. And the adoration in your voice. Dark, hidden places, rife with danger? Those have an altogether different but no less powerful sort of appeal. Elpis is a place of exceptional beauty in this age, so it may not make for a fair comparison. While we wait, will you not tell me about your adventures? Not the portentous events which led you here, but the simple delights all your own. By learning about the future world, I may gain insight into future me's plans. But more than that, I have an interest simply as a fellow traveler. Short of going somewhere oneself, there's naught more stirring than hearing another's account. Incredible! Would that I could have been there to see it! No subtitles, report if displayed. Yours is a harsh and unforgiving world. Yet in spite of this, your brethren hold fast to their virtue. To know that the light of mankind's potential still shines, even in that faraway place... It gives me heart. Thank you for regaling me with your tales. I will treasure every word. As you know, I was once a scholar. And among other things, I sought to understand the workings of the world. What exactly is aether? How formed the laws of nature? Whence sprung mankind? Riddles and mysteries beyond counting. Over the years I have managed to find answers to some few of them... Yet rather than attain a sense of mastery, the more I understood, the more I came to hold the world and its miracles in awe. We too are miracles, each and every one of us. Born of the warm breath of life that traverses the heavens, swirling through eternity. When I fully grasped the improbability of our existence, nothing felt impossible any more. If it could be imagined, it could be done. A passion swelled within me. An epiphany dispelling all preconceptions of what was natural and true. And a presence without. Immense yet intimate─fate, perhaps─holding us in its tender embrace... As reassuring as it was intimidating. How keenly aware I became of creation's fragility, built as it is upon precarious happenstance. I was overcome with an irrepressible urge to know the world more intimately. To hear its voice, feel its breath... I ventured forth on a journey that very day. So very long ago now. Freed from presumption and prejudice, I saw the world through a newborn's eyes. Everything fresh and new and so, so beautiful. Lands that stretched on forever. Skies one could drown in. The heartbeat of nature, silent yet strong. And amidst it all a people. Beacons of light and life. Laughter that warmed my heart like naught else before. They are my meaning and my purpose. My love. And so long as they need help, I cannot return to the star. Perhaps my future self is still waiting for it. The moment she can let go and walk unto the end... Safe in the knowledge that man will find his own way. You, who are our future... Tell me this and tell me true. Has your journey been good? Has it been worthwhile?

**VENAS:** Pray forgive my lateness! My observation subject was rather irritable, and it took a while to settle it down...

**GALENE:** No need to apologize─your work takes precedence. Besides, we had a pleasant conversation in the meantime.

**VENAS:** You're too kind. Now then, I'm told you wished to ask me some questions?

**GALENE:** Indeed. I've an interest in one of Hermes's creations─Meteion. You witnessed a host of them take flight, yes?

**VENAS:** Ohhh, that! Yes! Yes, I did! 'Twas in the dark of the morn. I'd left the Thalassai after nocturnal observation. As I walked along, I spied a bright light climbing high into the southeastern skies. Then, in an instant, it was gone─like a shooting star, only rising rather than falling. But then another shot up. Then another, and another. Intrigued, I made my way to the edge to investigate. And who should I spy on an isle to the south but Hermes and Meteion─the Meteia, rather. There were lots of them, and I realized they must be the shooting stars that I'd seen!

**GALENE:** A dazzling spectacle indeed... Have you spoken with Hermes about this?

**VENAS:** Oh, yes. The sight left such an impression on me that I approached him about his mystery project the very next day. Alas, he said that he couldn't reveal anything just yet─that he needed to conduct further tests. It shouldn't be long now, though. He often returns to that isle, and I have a feeling he's nearing a breakthrough.

**GALENE:** Splendid. We are likewise eager for the details. Well, that is all we wished to ask. Thank you for taking the time to indulge our curiosity.

**VENAS:** You're very welcome. It's always a pleasure to speak with other inquisitive souls. Oh, and will you be descending now? If so, I shall link the doors for you.

**METEION:** Please. 'Twas my intent to finish it, but clearly I underestimated you. One would think I never learn. I made the same mistake with Azem when we first sparred. Despite being less than half my age, his strength was astounding. One would think I never learn. I made the same mistake with Azem when we first sparred. Despite being less than half my age, her strength was astounding. As is yours. 'Tis plain you have weathered considerable hardship. Far more, even, than your tales would suggest. It seems we have both learned much on our journeys. Well now, I daresay he has warmed to you. A boon to be sure. He never forgets his favorites, and is ever eager to come to their aid. Quite a small place, lacking even the most basic equipment. The present may yield no clues, but we may yet try perusing the past. Have you done this before? So you cannot control the power freely. Worry not, I shall assist you. Come and stand before me. There are two ways to see the past. The first entails peering through the walls of the soul in the moment a subject is recalling a memory. The second requires no subject, and is instead a process of piecing together an event from ripples left in the ambient aether. As memories are etched upon the aether of the soul, so too are they etched upon the aether of the world. In this way can history be preserved. Such memories are given to fading, however, and can prove challenging to visit. But come, let us try. Close your eyes.

**HERMES:** All units fully functional and proceeding on course towards their respective stars. Estimated time to completion of survey is one hundred and eight cycles. End of status report. Severing connection with shared consciousness. Did you hear that, Hermes? All is well!

**METEION:** No subtitles, report if displayed. Yes, good tidings at long last... Every step of the way, I've been reminded how little we understand creation. How the universe defies imagination.

**HERMES:** But soon we won't need to speculate. We'll know the answers─what others live for!

**METEION:** Indeed... And we'll owe it all to you and your sisters.

**HERMES:** No subtitles, report if displayed. I wonder... What answers we will get?

**METEION:** Whatever intelligent beings that exist out there are bound to be vastly different from us. Diverse in form and culture. Possessed of unique ways of thinking. Their conception of life and its purpose will be no exception. Completely and utterly unlike ours.

**HERMES:** Utterly unlike...how?

**METEION:** I have no idea... Yet whatever answers we receive, I will not dismiss them out of hand. No, I will think earnestly on them all. Then I will share them with our people, that together we may contemplate our own existence. Perhaps then our star will become a better place─not only for man, but for all life. Meteion. Though I gave you wings to soar the heavens, I did not teach you how to walk the earth. So loath was I to bind another living being. In the course of your long journey, you will learn from those you meet. Learn to walk and run and so much more. And when you return, older and wiser, we will have a celebration to mark your homecoming and coming of age both.

**HERMES:** Will there be apples? Covered in syrup?

**VENAS:** And how are you supposed to eat them? Hmm... Rather than food... Perhaps... A flower. Yes. Upon your return, I will gift you a beautiful flower.

**000:** So, what is your opinion?

**VENAS:** What will you say? Hermes wouldn't wish for the Final Days. Hermes is a gentle soul. And yet... I couldn't say just by this moment alone.

**HERMES:** I am inclined to agree. As we had suspected, the two are somehow involved. Yet 'tis difficult to believe that they would deliberately seek to end all life. I understand. He is a gentle soul, and well intentioned. Yet it does not take ill intent to beget ill. We must consider the possibility that something may have gone awry. Perhaps it was oversight...or simply an accident. As you say, that was hardly conclusive. Yet based on what we witnessed, I find it difficult to believe that they would deliberately seek to end all life. Be that as it may, we cannot rule out the possibility that they will play a part in bringing about the Final Days. Perhaps unwittingly. In light of this... I propose that we reveal your tale to Hermes himself. If he does not wish for the Final Days, as we believe, he may well join us in pursuing a solution. Then it is settled. Let us seek out our friend with all swiftness. 'Twould not do to let such a pure soul be blackened by tragedy.

**EMETSELCH:** My apologies for keeping you waiting. I understand there is a matter you wish to discuss.

**HERMES:** Aye, a matter of the utmost gravity...if one can suspend disbelief. Go on, then. Tell him what you told us. Who you are and why you came.

**VENAS:** The Final Days...

**HERMES:** The phenomena observed during these star-encompassing calamities is likely the product of a dynamis reaction. And none is more versed in the applications of this energy than you, Hermes. I must stress that we do not believe you would desire such destruction. We come not to lodge accusations, but to beg your wisdom. And so, distressing though the exercise may be, I ask that you share with us your opinion on the matter─on the assumption that our visitor's tale is true.

**EMETSELCH:** Even you, Venat... As you say, the phenomena observed in the two calamities may both be attributed to dynamis. Of note is the difference in its effect. In the first Final Days, it warped creation magicks. In the second, it warped the people themselves. The key variable, I suspect, is the aetheric density of the men of each age. As you know, aether, in essence, negates dynamis. Harboring high concentrations of aether, we ancients cannot readily manipulate dynamis─nor be manipulated by it. Therefore, rather than our selves, the calamity affected our magicks. In contrast, having been sundered, the people of the future are composed of but a fraction of our aether. Thus are they susceptible to the influence of dynamis─and its transformative potential. But that would explain only the mechanism, not the cause... Though perhaps...

**HERMES:** What is it? Even should it be a hypothesis, we would hear it.

**VENAS:** Dynamis is an energy put in motion by feelings. Feelings for which there must first exist a source. A source to which the victims must be attuned─one that harbors the selfsame negative emotions. Elsewise, it could not be the agent of such extreme change.

**EMETSELCH:** So it wasn't the stagnation of the celestial currents... Someone─or something─is instigating the star's demise.

**HERMES:** So we've a villain on our hands after all... Any idea who or what it could be?

**METEION:** The celestial currents comprise the outermost layer of the star's aether, encasing it like a protective sphere. According to your tale, 'twas where the currents were weakest that the phenomena first manifested. If the inciting factor came from without Etheirys, then its effects would first be seen in those locations.

**HERMES:** Greetings. Can you hear me? Do not be alarmed─I mean you no harm. I wish only to hear your words. Share your feelings. Know your thoughts. May we please...be friends?

**METEION:** Meteion? What is it?

**HERMES:** Executing scheduled task. Suspending individual self and connecting to shared consciousness. Connection established. Commencing status report. Ah! Ahhh! Ahhhhhh! It hurts, it hurts! It hurts! So hot...so cold...so sad... I don't understand... Make it stop... Please, make it stop...

**METEION:** Steady, Meteion! Steady!

**EMETSELCH:** So scared...so lonely... The pain...it's too much... Why...why...why do we...they...hurt...hurt...hate...HATE! This is wrong! All wrong!

**HERMES:** She's...gone? But how?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** She has altered her aetheric density in order to blend in with her surroundings. An ability for avoiding confrontation.

**METEION:** Most effective...frustratingly so. I can't see her either─not even a trace.

**VENAS:** Stay away. Please. This is wrong. My mistake. So please...

**HERMES:** Are you all right? ...In your mind? No, we only heard her speak the instant before she vanished.

**EMETSELCH:** Of course. When communicating without words, Meteion also employs dynamis. That would explain why you were able to hear her when we could not.

**METEION:** Then you are our best chance of finding her. Follow her voice, and try to track her down. Hindered though we may be, let us split up and search as well. Aha! Give chase. We shall herd her into the shelter.

**HERMES:** No subtitles, report if displayed. No subtitles, report if displayed.

**METEION:** Please, Meteion. We must speak.

**HERMES:** I'm sorry, Hermes... I'm so sorry... If someone can hear these words, then please... Please...protect them. Protect them all. Individual self suspended. Connection with shared consciousness stable. Our survey is complete. We shall now report our findings. All units safely arrived at their respective destinations. Seeking answers to Hermes's question, we attempted to make contact with the intelligent denizens of each star. Results are as follows, in order of numerical code. Hena: Traces of civilization found─structures believed to have served as domiciles. No extant life-forms detected. Dyo: Ruined remnants of buildings scattered across star, surface of which is encased in ice. Presence of life could not be verified. Tria: Evidence of large population centers akin to cities recovered. No extant life-forms found─only their lingering essence. Tessera: Edifices surmised to be abandoned residences found. No extant life-forms detected. Deadly plague or extreme environmental degradation likely to have led to mass extinction.

**METEION:** They are all...dead?

**EMETSELCH:** Okto: Star found in state of violent conflict. Contact successfully made with inhabitants, but deployment of weapons of mass destruction resulted in total annihilation of local population shortly thereafter. Ennea: Star is a barren desert. No identifiable flora found. Bones of living beings resembling men discovered beneath sands, but determination regarding their intelligence inconclusive.

**HERMES:** Remind me, Hermes. What exactly was the question you entrusted to Meteion?

**EMETSELCH:** I tasked her with asking what others live for. What gives their lives...meaning...

**HERMES:** Did you consider what may happen if the premise of the question is flawed? To be able to answer it, one must be living─and desire to continue doing so. But if Meteion finds no living beings in the course of her journey... Or none who desire to live, what then? What answers would she derive from their silence?

**VENAS:** No subtitles, reported if displayed.

**METEION:** Meteion, enough. Suspend your mission and return hither at once.

**EMETSELCH:** Deka-pente: Local civilization once flourished under auspices of higher power. Said power later laid waste to civilization in fit of rage. Upon revealing this to me, entity elected to self-terminate in lieu of providing answer to question. No other intelligent life-forms found.

**HERMES:** Turning a deaf ear, are we? We are taking Meteion back to Amaurot. As I understand, we will need her if we are to bring back all of her sisters.

**EMETSELCH:** Y-Yes... Meteion... It isn't right, is it? It isn't right to turn away from the answer...even if the answer...is pain... Even if we aberrations must scream ourselves hoarse to be heard... Aye. Whatever answers we find, I will not dismiss them out of hand. These words I said to you...and I will hold myself to them.

**HERMES:** What is the meaning of this!?

**EMETSELCH:** You cannot take Meteion. Not until she has finished her report. All else must wait.

**HERMES:** You fool!

**EMETSELCH:** So, it comes to this. I've no wish to fight. But this time, I cannot yield. Though the world may think me a mad, desperate fool, I will hold fast to my conviction. No... My power...

**HERMES:** It's over, Hermes. In the name of the Convocation, I hereby take Meteion into custody. And setting aside the matter of your nomination, you will come with us, too. We require your knowledge to assess and resolve the situation.

**METEION:** No subtitles, report if displayed. Meteion... I'm so sorry... Would that I could have listened to your report in full... Reflected upon its meaning and conveyed it to others─that they might reconsider their chosen course... But I have failed, and that wish will never be realized. However... Ere our fates become the province of others, I bid you tell me...just one thing. Was there happiness in those distant stars? Was there a reason for living?

**EMETSELCH:** We conducted our search as per your instructions. We scoured historical records. Communed with the spirits of the deceased. Heard the final testaments of the dying. Welcomed their shadowed hearts into our own. One race had striven to create a world bereft of animosity. They renounced relationships to avoid interpersonal strife, and in so doing brought about societal collapse. One race had renounced war and devoted itself to the enrichment of its people. They were conquered. Though they destroyed the enemy in reprisal, they could not regain their former glory. One race had concluded that finite time was the root of all woes. Aspiring to shatter its shackles, they went in search of infinity. They discovered nothing is infinite, and that neither time or death can be cheated. Disillusioned, they gave up on the future─and themselves. One race had discarded all things that gave rise to sorrow, hoping to have only joy. They found joy lost its savor in the absence of sorrow, and lost their will to live. Though worlds apart, these peoples shared a belief. The belief that they had tried their best. That they had tried to fulfill their potential, with every step and success. In the course of which they learned the truth. That they would never be free of fear and sorrow, anger and despair─of loneliness─so long as they yet lived. Even now, their souls cry out for oblivion. And to this song of anguish, I lend my voice. We lend our voice. O beloved mankind, shimmering jewels of beautiful Etheirys... Rejoice, for we will free you from the cruel yoke of existence. There is no need to struggle in vain, for in nihility awaits salvation. You will know peace and serenity...and it will be beautiful. We will make our nest at the edge of the universe, and there in the dark of dead worlds hoard sorrow and suffering. There we will sing, our chorus ever louder and ever clearer, that our song may reach even this aether-shrouded star. Such is the answer we have found in the stars. Such is the gift we now offer to Etheirys.

**HERMES:** Who are you to decide our fate? To decree we live or die? Have you lost your mind!? You heard what she said! She means to destroy us all, yet you'd still take her side!?

**EMETSELCH:** In the name of the star, we have discarded those creations that we deemed flawed. If we ourselves are flawed, does it not stand to reason that we too should be discarded?

**HERMES:** That is sophistry and you know it!

**KAIROS:** Perhaps it is. Perhaps I am wrong. But who is to say that you are right? Let us settle this with a determination. In my authority as chief overseer of Elpis, I will make a judgment on man's fitness to exist. If he can learn to value all life and retain his will to live, even should his end be justified, he will surely find a way to avert his demise. If not, he will perish from the star. As with all determinations, provisions must be made to ensure fairness. Kairos! Awaken!

**HERMES:** (-Kairos-)Memory reconfiguration system Kairos activated. Awaiting instruction.

**KAIROS:** Command: universal memory alteration. Target area: Ktisis Hyperboreia. Starting point: arrival of Emet-Selch of the Convocation at Propylaion. End point: the present. Erase the memories of all events, and replace with a vague recollection of the following: I was here, preparing to demonstrate the functionality of Kairos to Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus. Meteion's shared consciousness became unstable. She and her sisters could not sustain their existence, and all dissipated with a burst. The resultant shockwave accidentally triggered Kairos, which erased several days of memories from all present. Execute.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Kairos-)Command acknowledged. Initializing... Three processes remaining to execution.

**HERMES:** Bravo. I daresay one would be hard-pressed to make it fairer... Everything that you told us, everything that has happened─the fact we've even met... It will all be gone.

**METEION:** Go, Meteion. To the edge of the universe, where none can reach you.

**HERMES:** Hermes. Won't you come with me? If you were to shed your flesh, I should be able to carry you.

**METEION:** No subtitles, report if displayed. I will remain. As a man, I will oppose the oblivion you bring.

**VENAS:** Silly fool... Had you said yes, I would've granted you the gentlest end.

**HERMES:** This ends here!

**EMETSELCH:** Fly, Meteion! No subtitles, report if displayed.

**VENAS:** That is far enough, Hermes!

**KAIROS:** Argos, to me! No subtitles, report if displayed.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Kairos-)First process complete. Two remaining to execution of memory reconfiguration.

**VENAS:** As if we needed more pressure... No matter what, you cannot forget what happened today. For it is the key to saving your future─your world. This fight is our fight; what comes after, our problem to contend with. Not yours. No, your own struggle awaits. And no one else can take your place. You must flee this place with your memories intact─and I will see that you do! Now then, where is it...? There you are, my little confluence.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Almost... No subtitles, report if displayed. Very well, then. You may elude us this day, but not forever!

**KAIROS:** Meteion's gotten away...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-Kairos-)Second process complete. One remaining to execution.

**HERMES:** No time for brooding. Listen well. Beyond lies a spatial confluence that connects the interior sections of this building. I will destroy the confluence and force open a way outside. When I do, you must jump through.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** I cannot tell you how sorry I am... ...But neither can I let you escape!

**HERMES:** Too brave by half... Exemplary work as always, Emet-Selch!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** What? But how? I thought the confluence was over...

**EMETSELCH:** Over there? Yes, we were rather hoping you would.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** It was never anywhere but where it is now. The instant those two began making their way towards nothing, 'twas clear the plan was a diversion.

**EMETSELCH:** I'm quite incapable of destroying a confluence, I must confess.

**KAIROS:** A gambit brazen beyond words. Though we've grown accustomed to reckless improvision due to the antics of an incorrigible associate. Though in the case of certain present company, “incorrigible” is an understatement. Honestly, I'm beginning to suspect it's a requirement for every Azem. There's no time! Quickly! Even now, I do not believe your tale. I would not suffer us to walk such a wretched path. Still, if it must be said... Do not squander it. The legacy I leave you.

**VENAS:** (-Kairos-)Final process complete. Executing universal memory alteration.

**000:** Go, Argos! No subtitles, report if displayed. I'm fine. Just a little tired. Can it be true? Are we the only ones left who see beauty in the world─in life? Are the stars above no more than husks of fallen civilizations? And yet... ...I feel her. Though she is unimaginably distant, I feel Meteion's presence─and the place whereto we must go. Ere she made good her escape, I placed an enchantment upon her. One which allows us to follow her trail. She has already left the outermost bounds of Etheirys, and continues on her way. Given the vastness of the universe, it will still be no easy feat to track her down. But thanks to Emet-Selch and Hythlodaeus, all is not lost. We remember. So long as we remember, our fates remain ours to shape.

**VENAS:** What will you say? What became of the others, I wonder... So...what now?

**HYPERBOREIASTAFF:** I'd like to know too. Let us ascertain the situation at Ktisis Hyperboreia, where they should still be. What indeed. Let us begin by ascertaining the situation at Ktisis Hyperboreia, where the others should still be. Given the likely state of their memories, however, 'twould be imprudent for us to approach them directly. In which case... I am sorry, my friend. I've asked much of you this day, but may I trouble you one last time? Argos will investigate in our stead. We will share in his consciousness, and see and hear as if we were with him. Now, close your eyes and open your mind...

**EMETSELCH:** Thank goodness you are unharmed.

**HERMES:** Unharmed? There is a gaping hole in my memories. I can scarcely remember arriving here in Elpis...

**HYPERBOREIASTAFF:** Forgive me... I was preparing to demonstrate the functionality of Kairos to our guests. But Meteion...her shared consciousness became unstable. And she...she...

**EMETSELCH:** So that's what prompted the state of alert. And when you went to investigate, you were caught in Kairos's accidental operation.

**HYPERBOREIASTAFF:** So it would seem... It's all a blur to me.

**EMETSELCH:** Such an unfortunate accident... Oh, and what of Venat and your other companion? You went inside together, as I recall.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** We did?

**HYPERBOREIASTAFF:** If Venat was with us, I have no recollection of it. But that there is her familiar, is it not? The fellow seems happy enough, so I think it safe to assume his mistress is well. I haven't the slightest notion who this other companion might be, however...

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Ah, well, that individual struck me as a bit...different, for want of a better word. Perhaps it wasn't actually a person, but some manner of creation.

**EMETSELCH:** Curious... I must ask Venat about it when next we meet.

**HERMES:** Yes, yes, you do that. Now, if we may tend to Hermes? Whatever this Meteion did, it seems he bore the brunt of it. Once you are fit to travel, you will return with us to Amaurot. We need to make certain there are no other ill effects. Also─I am here on business of the Fourteen. We've already had the conversation, like as not, but since your toy wiped my memory, we'll have to have it again.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Yes, of course. As you see fit.

**EMETSELCH:** This Kairos─it manipulates memories through the emission of aetheric waves, correct? There is a theory which holds that memories scoured by blasts of aether are restored when the soul is cleansed in the Underworld. If true, then perhaps when our time comes to return to the star, we shall remember these few days we have lost.

**VENAS:** I doubt aught of interest occurred. Look forward to the revelation if you like, but I should prefer to reminisce on more meaningful moments.

**000:** Let us rest. If only for a while. After all, you and I... We still have a long, long way to go. So...it is within. The portal that brought you hither...and will take you home.

**VENAS:** What will you say? Yes. This is where we part ways. Perhaps I should stay and help...

**HERMES:** May you and yours emerge triumphant. Make use of the knowledge you have gained, that your days in Elpis and our friends' sacrifice be not in vain. I appreciate your sentiment, I truly do, but 'tis a very long game that we must now play. And while you have maintained a stable presence here thus far, there are dangers in lingering overlong. No, you must return to your own battlefield. Make use of the knowledge you have attained, that your days here and our friends' sacrifice be not in vain. With Meteion free to pursue her designs, 'tis only a matter of time until the Final Days are upon us. We must be ready. From fortifying our defenses to securing our escape, there is much to be done. In spite of this, we cannot allow the report that set this calamity in motion to become common knowledge. Were the masses to learn the fates of the other stars, I fear the situation would spiral out of our control. I must carefully consider who can be trusted, and bring them into the fold. Ordinarily, I wouldn't hesitate to call upon the Fourteen. However, it was the desire for a fair determination that drove Hermes to attempt to erase our memories; were he made aware of his actions, there is no telling whether he would remain a friend or become a foe. Alternately, we might try to alienate him from the Convocation. Yet in doing so, we would deprive ourselves of a brilliant mind who would be invaluable in the crises to come. Quite the dilemma... Which is why I must work independently of the Convocation. Regardless of how we proceed, if we are to permanently avert the Final Days, we must be equal to Hermes's challenge. We must prove that mankind is worthy to exist. And this hinges, I think, on how we confront the all-consuming despair that accompanies a senseless and seemingly inevitable end. Bewildered and divided, we would perish like the peoples of those celestial ruins. We could not hope to survive the Final Days, much less take the battle to Meteion at her nest. We must find a way to defeat despair. To unite and prepare as many as possible for the struggle ahead. Heavy will weigh the burden of guiding this legion of souls... Yet I have faith in mankind's potential. As long as he believes in himself, there is naught he cannot achieve. So I will not give up on him. On us. You may find your world to be very different. Or perhaps the erasure of our friends' memories has sown the seeds of a conjunction between us. We cannot know until the moment is at hand. So shall I strive to do my best, taking naught for granted as I walk my path. And I pray you walk with me to the end. As you move forward, so too will I. As will all resolved to fight for the morrow. And when mankind has found the strength to stand against despair... We shall silence the song of oblivion. She who sings it will learn our journey is far from over. This I promise. Fare you well, my light of the future. Till we meet again.

**VENAS:** From this day forth, I shall strive to bring honor to the seat of Fandaniel.

**ANCIENTMEMORYA:** Even now, I remember standing there. Locked in a moment where the sky is aflame. Where stars fall as tears, and screams darken the seas. Where resignation rots the trees. Where terror twists magicks into abominations. Such is the lament of they who have gone before. The song of they who tried and failed to create a better world. The song of the end. That which hides at the edge of the universe is no longer hope's creation. It is hopelessness incarnate. That day, mankind saw half of its number sacrificed to bring forth Zodiark. And covering the star in a shroud of aether, we forestalled the Final Days. Yet the cries echoed still... We wept for innocence lost. Wailed for death inevitable. A reality too terrible to bear... And for too many, who sought comfort in gilded memories of joyful days and tranquil nights.

**ANCIENTMEMORYB:** This is all wrong... Why must we suffer so?

**VENAS:** It needn't be like this. No, there must be a way to restore things to the way they were. To reclaim the perfect paradise we once had.

**ANCIENTMEMORYA:** No, my friends. Suffering exists, and we cannot pretend otherwise. No civilization, however great, could eliminate it. If we would live, we must accept it as our constant companion. Let us not seek to forget this tragedy. Let us carry it in our hearts, that we may grow stronger and know true happiness.

**VENAS:** We can't accept it! We *won't* accept it! It will be ours again─a world free of sorrow!

**ANCIENTMEMORYB:** No, it will not, for there has ever been sorrow. Mankind was but spared its biting sting for a time. So please, open your eyes. To try and reclaim those lives we lost by sacrificing yet more isn't wisdom. It is weakness. No paradise is without its shadows. If we cannot accept this truth and learn from our pain, then our plight shall be repeated.

**ANCIENTMEMORYA:** O mighty Zodiark, god born of our boundless faith! We bid you hear our prayer! Accept this offering of lives, and deliver unto us the lives we once had. Deliver unto us the days of old... The days when the star was a font of love, and we knew naught but bliss!

**VENAS:** You would destroy it? Our beautiful world?

**HYDAELYN:** Lands that stretched on forever. Skies one could drown in. The heartbeat of nature, silent yet strong. And amidst it all a people. Beacons of light and life. Laughter that warmed my heart like naught else before. They are my meaning and my purpose. My love. In spite of...or perhaps because of this, I choose to believe. In mankind's potential. In his ability to find a way forward. So let there be no way back. From that temptation I sunder us. No more shall man have wings to bear him to paradise. Henceforth, he shall walk. All is excruciating pain. I breathe fire and torment. I birth a world of suffering to mire and plague. In one fleeting moment, lives come and go. Ever moving towards the unknown. And in that fleeting moment, they cry for the answer to the question: Why, given life, are they meant to suffer. To die... As fragmented, imperfect beings, yours is a never-ending quest. A quest to find your purpose, knowing your end is assured. To find the strength to continue, when all strength has left you. To find joy, even as darkness descends... ...And amidst deepest despair, light everlasting.

**REFUGEEMAN:** Earlier, on the Magna Glacies...

**FOURCHENAULT:** No... No, no... We were promised an escape... Not the same doom we fled... Report if displayed.

**ALPHINAUD:** I shall not meet my final days here in this blasted waste. Calm yourselves! Your panic is our greatest enemy. Come, we must build a line of defense. How...?

**ESTINIEN:** Leave the fighting to us, Father. You must lead the people to safety!

**ALPHINAUD:** Report if displayed. Tsk. I can handle this pair. You...

**ESTINIEN:** Shall tend to the refugees. Let us be about it!

**PALAKASWOMANB:**  Hmph. As you wish, my little lord!

**ALPHINAUD:** Help! Someone, please!

**PALAKASWOMANB:** What...?

**JULLUS:**   Report if displayed. No, no, n-no, don't! I don't want to die...

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)Forward! Let not a single fiend escape!

**JULLUS:** Wait, that's... Jullus and the army! So, you've recovered, then!

**ALPHINAUD:** In time enough to be of aid, for once. We can speak of it more later. For now, we must fight! To repay your salvation in kind─or with better. For Garlemald has her pride!

**FOURCHENAULT:** Of that, I've no doubt!

**ALISAIE:** Good gods... Of all possible saviors, the imperial army? Oh!

**GRAHATIA:** I had hoped to take all of them down at once!

**ALISAIE:** Think a withdrawal might be in order?

**GRAHATIA:** Sod that! You-know-who would never abandon these people to their fate. To be devoured by their former friends─that'd be beyond cruel. These beasts must fall here and now!

**ALISAIE:** Well then, I'd say it's high time we threw caution to the winds!

**GRAHATIA:** So long as you spare me the heroic sacrifices. Now, let's go!

**PALAKASMAN:** Not the barest trace of aether... Maybe there really is no way to bring them back.

**ALISAIE:** Thank you for saving our lives once again! I remember you, from Purusa. You helped us there, too, didn't you?

**GRAHATIA:** Ah, you're from Palaka's Stand! I'm glad you're still in one piece. ...Or you will be, once I see to that injury of yours.

**ALISAIE:** Look out!

**GRAHATIA:** Report if displayed. Report if displayed.

**ALISAIE:** Report if displayed. Get out of here, quickly! I won't lose them...not a one. This will be a brighter future. I won't let a madman's apocalypse ruin everything we fought to achieve!

**000:** Get it together, Alisaie! You're embarrassing yourself...and in front of Father, no less. You might never measure up to our champion... But we ask too much of her as it is. You mustn't let our sword in the darkness fight alone! But we ask too much of her as it is. You mustn't let Eorzea's hero fight alone! Oh...

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? I'm back! You've done well in my absence. This is precisely why you should never skip your squat regimen.

**GRAHATIA:**  Hmph. I can look after myself, you know.

**ALISAIE:** Everything's in order, I trust?

**FOURCHENAULT:** I've had enough of this rabble. Come on!

**PALAKASWOMANA:** You must board without delay. The ship will depart ere long.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Your offer to host us in Sharlayan is most appreciated, but will the Final Days not soon fall upon it as well?

**PALAKASWOMANA:** Your hesitation is not unwarranted. The satrap entrusted me with your lives, yet I have failed your comrades. Nor are you wrong to fear that this corruption will continue to spread. I cannot promise you complete safety, even in my homeland. What I can promise is that I will do all in my power to protect you. That power is not inconsiderable. Even now, my countrymen are preparing the vessel that will deliver us to a sanctuary on the moon. Join us on our journey there and beyond, to new horizons. Come to Old Sharlayan. Please.

**ALPHINAUD:** We would be fools to refuse such a generous offer made in earnest.

**FOURCHENAULT:** It seems they've a new destination.

**ALPHINAUD:** The people of Radz-at-Han have known too much suffering. The march to Garlemald will only bring them more, short though it may be.

**FOURCHENAULT:** I quite agree. Fortunately, they have you to look after them.

**JULLUS:** Yes, well...

**ESTINIEN:** Behind you! Just there!

**ALPHINAUD:** More of them?

**GRAHATIA:** Zenos!? Here!?

**ALPHINAUD:** You'll be all right. Hurry to the airship.

**ZENOS:** Why have you come?

**ALISAIE:** A heretofore unseen beast. 'Twas ripe for the slaying. Poor sport, alas. Unfit to temper my blade.

**ZENOS:** Oh, for the love of─ You cannot *still* be on about a rematch!

**JULLUS:** That is and has ever been my sole concern. You, on the other hand, are fixated on a different quarry. Your passion pales before mine, yet neither hate nor despair seem sufficient to recapture your misdirected bloodlust. So I hone my blade, and I wait.

**ZENOS:** That's it? That's all you care about? Garlemald is in ruins. Our homeland─the nation you rule!─is as good as gone. Along with so many of its people. Not just soldiers like us! Not only those who fought and killed for power and duty. Innocent civilians... Murdered by their own flesh and blood. Lost and confused as they breathed their last. While we who survived with our lives and minds intact were left to freeze to death! The Eorzeans tell me all this was your doing. You slaughtered your countrymen. You did. For what?

**JULLUS:** For nothing, in the end. So much wasted effort.

**ALPHINAUD:** You... You bastard!

**JULLUS:** For your own sake, Jullus, you must control your anger! It will serve no one should it consume you and see you transformed.

**ZENOS:** Report if displayed.

**JULLUS:** Would you be “happier” had I a “good reason”?

**ZENOS:** What?

**JULLUS:** If my motives met with your approval, would you no longer resent the outcome? If so, then perhaps a beast's skin would suit you better. Duty...honor...morality...all constructs of convenience, when put to proof. Surely the war taught you how easily power becomes the tool of the self-righteous? How the people's “justice” was merely a means to their ends? Yet you would ask me why. Ask any creature of this star and those above for answers, and they will tell you what suits their fancy. And they would be right to do so. What meaning there is to be found in the petty vicissitudes of your existence must be gleaned by you and you alone. Should you seek it in battle─in the fruitless pursuit of my demise─then come. Assume your rightful place as a notch on my blade.

**ALISAIE:** You are a blight on the Garlean race, and there would be no more satisfying way to expunge it than by beating you to death. But I will not be party to another tragedy. I refuse to lose anyone else because of you. So go! Go, and may we never suffer your madness again.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Zenos! Perhaps you've found meaning in living this way─I cannot deny you've found strength. Yet if you only pursue your hedonistic pleasures, and pay no heed to the plight of others, then no one will give you the time of day. You will never get what you want─not even the battle you pine for so dearly. You'll be alone for an eternity, and you'll deserve every agonizing second of it.

**ALPHINAUD:** We are ready to depart. The refugee ships will be leaving shortly, but I've asked mine to remain for the time being. There's room enough for you to join me on it, if you wish. Do contain your surprise. I needn't agree with the Scions' methods or intentions to acknowledge that their deeds are deserving of gratitude.

**FOURCHENAULT:** We appreciate the offer, but might I ask why you are delaying your departure? I presume it is not solely for our benefit.

**ALPHINAUD:** I must visit Garlemald ere we return to Sharlayan. Having caused such an uproar, 'tis only meet that I explain myself to the Ilsabard contingent.

**ESTINIEN:** Allow us to accompany you, then. We should be glad to facilitate, given our familiarity with all concerned. If you would like to join as well, Jullus, we can speak of recent events on the way.

**LUCIA:** He'll be after your seat on the Forum next.

**ALPHINAUD:** No major injuries then. Good. I briefed the recovered soldiers and sent them on their way as quickly as I could, but nevertheless feared they would not make it in time.

**FOURCHENAULT:** The additional support was invaluable. Your men saved more than a few lives. ...Though not all, I regret to say.

**LUCIA:** I take it that I am addressing Lucia Junius? I am the Forum's envoy, Fourchenault Leveilleur. And you are owed an explanation for these most dire developments.

**JULLUS:** Another trial wrought by the Final Days... I was beginning to suspect as much. You doubtless feel some consternation having been forced to abandon your original plan─but trust me when I say you were right to send the refugees elsewhere. Beasts have been sighted within the capital. Perhaps it was a stroke of grim fortune that the population was decimated beforehand, as they've yet to appear in any great number, but in time... In any case, Maxima leads the remainder of the contingent in an effort to cull the creatures and evacuate the populace as we speak. Once the airships have taken to the skies, I pray your men can be persuaded to join him.

**LUCIA:** You'll permit us to retain our weapons?

**ALPHINAUD:** I wouldn't have sent you after the Scions were I expecting you to stab them in the back.

**JULLUS:** And I, for one, would not consider past transgressions more relevant than future contributions. Regardless of the circumstances that saw us at odds before, we need men of courage now. More than ever.

**FOURCHENAULT:** We swore to defend Garlemald. And so we shall.

**ALPHINAUD:** It seems you have everything under control. You will excuse me, then, for mine own duties await.

**FOURCHENAULT:** A moment, Master Fourchenault. You did desire to express your appreciation for services rendered, did you not?

**ALPHINAUD:** I did... Though if you intend to again ask that Sharlayan alter its course, you will find my gratitude insufficient.

**FOURCHENAULT:** 'Tis nothing so onerous. I wish to hear the details of this grand endeavor of yours.

**ALPHINAUD:** Do you swear to listen and to learn, and not to embark upon some scheme to impede us?

**FOURCHENAULT:** I swear.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...Hmph. Any other I would doubt, but you I trust to keep your word. For not once have you broken it. Very well. I will request that the Forum make you privy to our plans. You may await our summons at the Baldesion Annex─assuming the decision is in your favor. Does that suffice?

**GRAHATIA:** It does. You have my thanks.

**PUDDINGWAY:** Excellent! You can regale us with tales of your most recent sojourn to the First while we wait. Did you...hear something just now?

**GRAHATIA:** (-???-)Pudding... Puuuddiiing... Where, oh where, is this star's blasted pudding!?

**URIANGER:** Um...?

**ALISAIE:** Dawn may banish even the darkest night... And to this bitter clime bring warmth and comfort. 'Tis heartening to see such an assembly upon my return. I thought often of you whilst I looked down upon our star's brilliance from the moon above.

**URIANGER:** Yes, but what are you doing here? And dressed like that! Aren't you cold?

**LIVINGWAY:** Verily. I fear for my health should I proceed to expound upon our purpose ere I procure more suitable garments...

**MAPPINGWAY:** Then allow me to summarize─we're here because none of you lot are up there! Nor has anyone deigned to send word about any changes in the plans! It's rude, is what it is. Least that's what I thought at first, but then folks got to wondering if you weren't in a spot of bother, so we decided to take matters into our own hands. Come down here and help, if our help be needed.

**SINGINGWAY:** So she says, but it's also something of a convenient excuse to visit Etheirys. Urianger made it sound absolutely marvelous. More so before the impending doom, but still.

**PUDDINGWAY:** And it's not like there will ever be a better time! What with the aforementioned doom.

**LIVINGWAY:** *Marvelous*, they say, yet not an onze of pudding to be found! I must suffer Urianger's inferior works no more...

**FOURCHENAULT:** Hey! Maybe consider the plight of present company before you go blathering on about pudding and doom? Ahem! As I was saying─should you require any assistance with...whatever, we are at your disposal. We were born from Hydaelyn's love for the lives of this star, so naturally we would much prefer to see them continue. Twiddling our thumbs up on the moon is hardly conducive to that, though, is it? Aye, not when you've all got such precious thoughts, and feelings, and hopes for the future, deserving of more active preservation. Speaking to Urianger made us realize that while we've carried out our duties to the letter, we've failed to fulfill them in spirit. From there it was just a hop, skip, and a jump towards resolving to do better! So please, show us how. Help us help you!

**URIANGER:** Forgive me, but are they...?

**LIVINGWAY:** Thy distant collaborators, indeed.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Hail fellow well met! You'd be a member of the Forum, would you? It's an honor and a pleasure to meet you at last. I'm Livingway, Hydaelyn's right paw. That last bit is very important─as am I, if I may humbly say so myself.

**URIANGER:** I, er...bid you welcome to our star, Livingway. On behalf of the Forum, I thank you for traveling such a distance to meet us. As you have surmised, preparations for the exodus have not proceeded as smoothly as we had hoped. I should be happy to personally escort you to our headquarters in Sharlayan, where you may advise us as you deem fit.

**000:** 'Twas with reluctance that I set aside the great work of readying the moon for habitation. Be assured that I did so only after the Loporrits made plain their earnest desire to come hither, and I myself felt a growing certainty that their contributions here would prove invaluable. 'Tis trite, perhaps, but...I followed my heart.

**URIANGER:** What will you say? Good to haveth you back! May thy disciples banish this darkest of nights.

**ALISAIE:** For a time, at least. Nevertheless, 'twas worth the journey to find present company well. Report if displayed. I am no esteemed philosopher of eld. Nevertheless, 'tis my hope that what little knowledge I shared shall serve them well, and perchance help save us all. Wilt thou attend us at the Forum, and lend thine own wisdom?

**GRAHATIA:** If that's all quite settled, can we start moving before Urianger catches his death? Even I'm freezing out here.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, I daresay you'll warm up quickly once you're aboard the airship, sat shoulder to shoulder with our fur-covered friends.

**ALISAIE:** There is a matter I wish to raise with you before we enter. We are here to listen and to learn─but if the Forum's plans are more or less what I expect, then I should like to make a proposal that will serve our ends... By your leave, of course.

**KRILE:** I don't see why not. Your words and wits have gotten us this far.

**ALPHINAUD:** Agreed. I will present our queries so that you may consider the most advantageous way to advance your proposal without distraction.

**BARNIER:** Thank you, everyone.

**KRILE:** If I may have your attention─the ad hoc session will now commence. The purpose of today's assembly is to brief the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, at their request, on the great exodus. You may enter. On behalf of the Forum, I commend your heroic actions on the Magna Glacies. We shall not soon forget your service to us and the people of Radz-at-Han. The satrap, whom we have informed of the refugees' new arrangements, sings your praises as well. As an expression of our gratitude, we will endeavor to answer your questions as fully and openly as we are able.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Then let us begin. First─it is the Forum's objective to ferry the life and knowledge of this star to the moon. Am I correct?

**YSHTOLA:** You are. It is for this purpose that Sharlayan has labored these many long years. We have collected biological samples and scientific records from across the star. When the time comes, they will be moved from their places in Labyrinthos and Noumenon and conveyed to safety. Once that critical task has been accomplished, we will begin transporting the Sharlayan citizenry, which has been categorized into groups. The earliest arrivals are to ensure hospitable environs for those who come after. Following our people, we will send those of other nations in turn, beginning with our allies. Radz-at-Han was foremost among these, but since the Final Days have already come to Thavnair, we saw fit to include the refugees with earlier groupings.

**FOURCHENAULT:** An ambitious plan. You have accounted for the safety of all nations and tribes, then?

**YSHTOLA:** ...As many as we can.

**FOURCHENAULT:** And how, pray tell, do you decide who to leave behind?

**KRILE:** To journey beyond the sky is an unprecedented and immeasurably difficult endeavor. Introducing sources of inevitable conflict would condemn all to certain death.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Questions as to the validity of that approach aside... Are your plans proceeding apace? We're under the impression that your primary means of celestial transportation is incomplete.

**ALISAIE:** If only in that it does not meet our optimal parameters, that is correct. This ark, as some have taken to calling it, is fully operational and could be launched even today. However, the Final Days have progressed more quickly than we anticipated. At present, the ship is incapable of attaining speeds sufficient to meet our evacuation targets. Should we put the vessel into service as it is now, we will be unable to travel to the moon and back quickly enough to complete the necessary number of trips. Precious lives and knowledge will be lost.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Seven hells... Is there anything to be done?

**ALPHINAUD:** The aetherburner─the primary means of propulsion once the craft is in the space between stars─is undergoing testing to determine whether it can be made more efficient. Though cargo is being loaded for the initial phase of the exodus, we are prepared to continue our experimentation up to the day before launch should it prove necessary.

**YSHTOLA:** What if the Scions were to solve your problem? We shall help devise a means to improve the aetherburner's efficiency─on two conditions. If we succeed, you must allow us to meet with Hydaelyn.

**ALPHINAUD:** 'Twas simple enough to deduce. You have a concord, and so you would never have abandoned the Antitower had you no other means of communication. One far more convenient, I suspect.

**FOURCHENAULT:** The second condition, also to be met upon our success, is that we be permitted to propose another use for your ark.

**ALPHINAUD:** We would be at liberty to refuse this proposal?

**MONTICHAIGNE:** Of course. If we cannot prove its merit to the ninety-nine here, who are we to stake on it the lives of all peoples of this star?

**BARNIER:** Hahaha! Delightful as always, Master Alphinaud! Report if displayed. We couldn't have asked for a finer plan. “Allow us to solve this complex engineering problem of which we were entirely unaware until moments ago. What could possibly go wrong?” Haha! The satire writes itself! Report if displayed. Yet what field has not benefited from a change in perspective? When we are at wits' end, what we need is not the same dry theories recited ad nauseam, but fresh inspiration. I, for one, have faith in my erstwhile students to provide it. And I find their terms to be perfectly acceptable.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Order! Order! We have no time to waste on debate. I call a vote. All in favor of agreeing to the Scions' terms? Seventy-one in favor, twenty-eight against. The ayes have it. Fourchenault, as the architect of this project, you are the best candidate to show them its current state. ...And bear in mind that, regardless of your personal misgivings, this is the will of the Forum.

**BARNIER:** Very well.

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** I call this session to a close. Return to your tasks with urgency─the Final Days wait for none.

**FOURCHENAULT:** I could swap 'em out... No─been there, done that, damn near lost me eyebrows... Think, Kokkol, think! We'd be well on our way to paradise, visionaries pattin' themselves on the backs for their grand accomplishments if you'd only *think*!

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** Yes... That does sound rather lovely...

**FOURCHENAULT:** Gyaaah! ...I mean, Master Fourchenault, what a pleasant surprise! We're not blastin' off already, are we!?

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** The schedule remains unchanged. For better or worse... Which is why the Forum has elected to accept assistance in resolving the aetherburner conundrum.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Huh. Not seen you lot down here before.

**ALPHINAUD:** There are Archons among their number, but engineering is not their expertise. Nevertheless, the Forum concedes the slim possibility that they may have insights to offer. If not, you are at liberty to return them to the surface...by whatever means you see fit.

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** I assure you that won't be necessary. Now, about your troubles with the aetherburner...?

**URIANGER:** Aye, aye, I'll walk you through it. S'pose I could do with a change of pace. As the name ought to tell you, the aetherburner “burns” aether─ambient or otherwise─and transforms it into motive force. Think of it like a giant bomb that never stops explodin'. Even out in that black void where the aether's right sparse, it's strong enough to move our ark. And it probably won't kill you like an actual bomb! ...But it ain't perfect. Accordin' to my calculations, to travel to the moon and back fast enough for the Forum's likin', the conversion rate needs to be six percent more efficient. “A measly six percent,” you say, but if I could've squeezed even another “point six” out of it, don't you think I'd've built it that way in the first place!?

**FOURCHENAULT:** Hast thou consulted with the Loporrits?

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** Yes. They too are conducting their own research, for lack of a ready answer. The moon's propulsion systems are considerable, naturally, yet they are commensurately massive. It is no easy feat to convert their technology into an efficient means of propulsion for a “teeny-tiny toy boat,” as they say─and as I most certainly do not.

**GRAHATIA:** Yes, exactly! Damn it all, I ask for refined adamantite and they send me uppity rabbits with inscrutable, ancient, incompatible technology... You tryin' to drive me mad?

**YSHTOLA:** Do you speak of *Allagan*-refined adamantite, perchance?

**GRAHATIA:** You know of it?

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** Only in the most general terms, I'm afraid. 'Twas an alloy of Allagan make, but the secrets of its production were closely guarded. As I recall, the records stated it was vital to Dalamud's construction and launch.

**ALISAIE:** Aye, that's the stuff! No material more conductive far as I know. Slottin' some in's like blowing up a dam and watching the river of aether come rushing through! Ain't a living soul that knows how to make it, though. We were fortunate enough to salvage some for the aetherburner─just a wee bit, mind─from a chunk of Dalamud that came hurtlin' into the Northern Empty during the Calamity. With more...well, that extra six percent efficiency would be child's play. It's a cryin' shame that we've no other sources.

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** Surely the many shards of Dalamud scattered throughout Eorzea would suffice. Why not get the refined adamantite from them?

**ALISAIE:** Oh we tried, believe you me. But only a few specialized pieces would've had any in 'em to begin with. Drive cores from Ragnarok-class internment hulks─those are the prize bits we really need. But accordin' to the gleaners, gettin' to 'em means delvin' deep into the shards─and the defenses are still very operational and very eager to blow 'em up. It's rough goin' in there, even for the cream. Not sure they'd make it out alive...

**000:** ...Weren't we near that part of the *Ragnarok* when we went to destroy Bahamut?

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? You want me to go and fetch the wotsits? The White Raven's ghost...it haunts me... This sounds like a job for someone else.

**ALPHINAUD:** That may be for the best...though you'd doubtless find the task too dull for your liking. Heavens, are you alright? You look pale as a...well! Best put that battle from your mind for now. Deep breaths, that's it... Oh, very funny. Hah hah.

**THANCRED:** Hmm... There are multiple internment hulks in Eorzea alone, so handling this ourselves may not be the most efficient option. Rather, if we could salvage adamantite from the shards simultaneously... Thancred, is the linkshell we established before you went to Garlemald still active?

**FOURCHENAULT:** Of course. The floor is yours.

**ALPHINAUD:** What's all this?

**LUCIA:** Gathering firewood, so to speak. We alone can accomplish little, but joined by others, we may yet build a bonfire to carry us heavensward. This is Alphinaud. The Scions have need of you.

**ARUHNSENNA:** (-Lucia-)Understood. I will contact the Lord Commander and dispatch our finest at once.

**YSHTOLA:** (-A-Ruhn-Senna-)My sisters are somewhat preoccupied with the Final Days─so I will lead the Twelveswood expedition myself.

**GRAHATIA:** Are you aware of any other sources of refined adamantite?

**CIRINA:** Logically, such an invaluable alloy would have been utilized solely where absolutely necessary─in components intended to conduct or collect surpassing amounts of aether. Any extant instrumentation or devices would have likely found their way into the hands of aetherologists or...enthusiasts.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Cirina-)Magical artifacts of Allagan design? The Eastern alliance will send word to one and all. (-Cirina-)Are there other ways we may offer aid? No shards of the lesser moon scar our soil, but our stake in this cause is no less for it...

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** Is there anything in Othard that might be of use to you?

**ALPHINAUD:** Othard, you say!? You've got friends in far places, lad! Anyroad, if you're offerin', I wouldn't say “no” to one of those Far Eastern sacred relics. Some of them can hold enough aether to summon a whole damn primal. Combine a source like that with the aetherburner and three...two...one...kaboom!

**CIRINA:** ...I gather you heard his explosive enthusiasm. Might you secure us a suitable relic?

**SICARD:** (-Cirina-)It shall be done! I know little of machines, but I promise we will do our utmost to gather the materials you need to finish your starship. (-Cirina-)I am glad for the work, in truth. Better to busy oneself than wait and fret over disasters foretold.

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Sicard-)Then why're we all still standin' about yappin'? There's plunder for the takin'─an' I'm a born plunderer! (-Sicard-)I'll be in Ol' Sharlayan before you know it. Start mixing the grog!

**ALISAIE:** I'm certain that can be arranged. Thank you all─and do be careful.

**ALPHINAUD:** Just like that!

**SYSTEM:** Aye, just like that, our refined adamantite is on its way. Now let us consider our next steps, shall we? There's yet much to be done.

**NANAMOULNAMO:** Meanwhile, in Ul'dah...

**FYRGEISS:** ...Our course of action is clear. We must harvest refined adamantite from the shards of Dalamud, and procure arcane relics of Allagan make. Summon the best and brightest of our Immortal Flames, and form an expeditionary party at once! Call upon the Sultansworn and Brass Blades for support as you must. Papashan, send word to the guilds. We will require the expertise of master artisans if we are to have any hope of identifying and recovering these elusive materials. Fyrgeiss, we have need of your Stone Torches. They are to assist the Immortal Flames in scouring the ruins, and to help secure the surrounding areas. I trust I can count on your support?

**NANAMOULNAMO:** As commander of the Stone Torches, my son Zirnberk will personally see it done.

**SYSTEM:** Pipin. I would have you lead the raiding party. Assemble your finest, and with Tizona's blade clear the way. Lord Lolorito, I pray you take charge of the search for Allagan relics. Surely you know of some being traded on open or clandestine markets, or sleeping in collectors' vaults. Of course, I ask not that you do this out of the kindness of your heart. By all means, profit on the transactions. I wish you the joy of it. The Final Days descend upon our world. If circumstances are truly as dire as they say, Ul'dah's best efforts may be for naught. And yet, when we Eorzeans rose from the ashes to rebuild our broken realm, did we not learn one simple truth? That which seems all but impossible to overcome alone, may yet be possible if we stand together. It was the Scions who united us then, and it is the Scions who call upon us now. Ul'dah will answer that call. We will summon our courage, and join the fight for our world's future. You know your duties! I, Nanamo Ul Namo, seventeenth in the line of Ul, bid you good luck and godsspeed!

**ARUHNSENNA:** Meanwhile, in the Black Shroud...

**LYSE:** We've fielded a goodly number, but our ranks are heavy with healers. And an abundance of restorative magicks will be of little help in destroying Dalamud's defenses. Still, it has ever been thus with Gridania. We must steel ourselves for a protracted engagement...

**ARUHNSENNA:** (-???-)In that case, might I suggest taking us along?

**LYSE:** Commander Hext!? What are you doing here?

**ARUHNSENNA:** None of the shards in Gyr Abania are big enough to hold an internment hulk. So we said to ourselves─why not lend our neighbors a hand? We thought you might be short on people with a talent for breaking things.

**LYSE:** While it pains me to admit it...you are right. Are our deficiencies so plain to see?

**ARUHNSENNA:** It might've been a lifetime ago, but I was once one of the Scions assigned to the Shroud. I know this forest well. I know your people. And I know we will be stronger if we fight this fight together.

**LYSE:** Then I will impose upon you with a clear conscience. Come, let us speak of how to integrate our forces.

**SYSTEM:** I won't let it all be for nothing. I promise you, Papalymo...

**EMMANELLAIN:** Meanwhile, in Coerthas...

**SYSTEM:** There...there you are! We've no time to waste, Brother! Everyone has already... Ah. That...that was a roar. A dragon's roar!

**HANCOCK:** Meanwhile, in the Ruby Sea...

**SOROBAN:** ...And so, in summation, the Eastern alliance, as well as the honorable Lord Lolorito himself, reached out to me for assistance in procuring these treasures of the divine─and I, in turn, do beseech the Confederacy for aid. Hm? Is that...?

**LIVINGWAY:** Hancock? What a surprise this is! And a fortuitous one at that. I have a favor to ask, you see...

**THANCRED:** Phew! Finally, some rest. Why, I haven't spoken so much in...well, in forever!

**URIANGER:** Lively, isn't it? The town is abuzz─everyone eager to meet with our friends from the moon.

**THANCRED:** 'Twould behoove you to consult with Sleepingway. As our moon's pilot, his advice should be most pertinent...

**LIVINGWAY:** I'm impressed. Truth be told, I struggle to tell one from another. No offense intended, of course...

**THANCRED:** None taken! After you and your friends left Mare Lamentorum, we spent no small amount of time with your Urianger. Oh, the conversations we had! He told us all about Etheirys─answered our every question, no matter how trifling or trivial. Look! Every page, filled to the margins with knowledge! When I first arrived, I was struck by how little I knew. It was daunting...but then I realized that were it not for Urianger and his teachings, we'd still be stuck on the moon. Gazing at your world and wondering what we've been missing...

**WILFSUNN:** Report if displayed. What would they think if they could see Urianger now? I daresay they'd be more than a bit surprised...and impressed, no doubt. Master Louisoix, Minfilia, Papalymo. And not to forget...

**URIANGER:** Ho there! Heard there was a visiting expert who we might bother with a few questions. I take it you'd be the one?

**THANCRED:** Y-Yes... I am...

**URIANGER:** Wilfsunn and Bloewyda. Sharlayan's foremost researchers in the field of teleportation magick. ...And Moenbryda's parents.

**WILFSUNN:** It hath been some time. 'Tis... 'Tis good to see you in...good health.

**BLOEWYDA:** Likewise, old friend! Bloewyda and I were most honored to answer the call. Never expected this reunion, though, did we, dear?

**URIANGER:** I'll say! The nerve...sending that letter, then running off to the gods know where! Do you have...any idea...how worried we were?

**WILFSUNN:** Report if displayed. I...I'm sorry. 'Twas remiss of me...not to deliver the news in person. No, more than that... 'Twas I who...

**BLOEWYDA:** Our daughter was disillusioned after Master Louisoix left her behind. The day the Scions called upon her was the happiest I'd seen her in years. She made her every choice of her own free will. No one could've ever forced her to do otherwise. Don't blame yourself for her death. Celebrate her life. You know that's what she'd want.

**URIANGER:** If there is one thing we resent you for, it was that we could not be there to mourn her with you... Reading the words you penned in that shaky hand... We must have cried as much for you as we did for her.

**BLOEWYDA:** I'm sorry. I truly, truly am... I knew not what to say. Knew not how to express my feelings... The poems and platitudes of wiser men. Musings on sadness and loss... Studied and memorized...and meaningless in the moment.

**WILFSUNN:** Silly boy... We are all powerless before such grief. Even now, try as I might, the words escape me... But in our hearts, we know. We always know.

**BLOEWYDA:** I remember when you were young. How the lads teased you for choosing the company of books over others. Our Moen didn't take kindly to that. “Be nice to Urianger!” she'd shout, and give them a walloping. No matter how many times we scolded her...

**WILFSUNN:** So we offered a suggestion: rather than starting fights, why don't you be the bridge between Urianger and the others? She had to mull it over for a while. Arms crossed, brow furrowed in intense thought... But from that day on, she never let you be alone. She'd drag you outside to play, pepper you with endless questions, read the same books you read...all to try and understand you that much better. I'm sure it was annoying and exhausting at the time...but she only ever had the best of intentions.

**BLOEWYDA:** And look at you now. At the center of the crowd─the reason there even is a crowd, having brought these people together. You've no idea how proud we are.

**URIANGER:** To see the boy our daughter trusted and believed in more than anyone...grow into the man she always knew he could be. I can see her in you, too. Feel her. She walks with you, wheresoever you go. So thank you, Urianger. For being who you are.

**LIVINGWAY:** Report if displayed. I...I think...I can feel her, too... The truth...of her life. Not sorrow...but hope. And love...

**THANCRED:** This Moenbryda...she was important to him, wasn't she?

**LIVINGWAY:** ...You could ask the man himself.

**THANCRED:** Oh no, no. But watching this exchange reminds me how much I've yet to learn about your world...and its people.

**YSHTOLA:** You can live here your entire life and hardly learn a thing. That's why...it's too soon for this to end.

**ESTINIEN:** All set, I take it?

**ALISAIE:** We've finished what we could. Delivered supplies, tracked down escaped animals...trivial tasks as they may be.

**GRAHATIA:** That's enough, don't you think? If there was anything more important still undone, that would be a problem in itself.

**THANCRED:** The vessel is essentially ready for departure. All that remains is to load the final batch of supplies and see everyone on board. Once we've readied the aetherburner, that is...

**URIANGER:** Ah...had a feeling we might find you all here.

**THANCRED:** Our consultations with the Loporrits, too, have run their course. Pleased I am to say that our researchers' concerns have for the most part been allayed, though some insist on making adjustments to the very end. For their part, Livingway and her peers have graciously offered to stay and keep the people company, lest any lingering queries go unanswered.

**KRILE:** All that remains is to wait for the refined adamantite...

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Krile-)Alphinaud, are you there? It's me, Krile. (-Krile-)Your special delivery has arrived! Round up everyone and come to the harbor at once!

**OFFICECLERK:** Speak of the devil... Let us go at once!

**ALPHINAUD:** Forgive the intrusion, Master Fourchenault─I bring urgent news! A great commotion has broken out in Scholar's Harbor. Your presence is requested with all speed!

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** Now, where might this delivery be? Oh!

**ALISAIE:** I'm sure it's very important, but we cannot accept these without the proper permits!

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** By the Twelve! Surely these can't all be...

**SICARD:** Bleedin' hellfire! They're bringin' 'em by sea *and* by air! All these folks and these crates...

**EMMANELLAIN:** And more on the way. Got your adamantite right here─a bigger haul than any o' these sorry bastards brought, and that's no lie!

**SICARD:** Yes, because you were charged with seeing the shipments from Gridania and Ul'dah here along with your own. Give credit where credit is due.

**EMMANELLAIN:** Sounds like the sorry whingin' of a sore loser─an' a hypocrite to boot. Ain't no way a scrawny whelp like you took a dozen steps inside a Dalamud shard.

**SICARD:** I'll have you know I went all the way to the entrance! Furthermore, 'twas my contacts that enabled us to enlist the cooperation of the sky pirates. I'll have you know I went all the way to the entrance! I played a vital role in keeping a lookout whilst our expeditionary forces secured the adamantite.

**EMMANELLAIN:** Left you outside so you wouldn't get anyone killed, did they? Well then, credit where credit's due─you did a right fine job sittin' on your arse!

**SICARD:** Take that back!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Make me!

**HANCOCK:** I will not stoop to your level!

**ALPHINAUD:** My, what a grand welcome party!

**HANCOCK:** Hancock! And Soroban!

**SOROBAN:** We come bearing relics both sacred and Allagan─as well as a few other gifts that may be of help─to be presented with best wishes from the Eastern alliance. Our friends in Bozja, for instance, have sent along a few artifacts for the “brave allies of the Resistance.” That's you! And we've brought a number of items from Eureka as well, courtesy of one Ejika Tsunjika! He says, “A little advance warning would have been appreciated,” by the by. And we've brought a number of items from Eureka as well, courtesy of our hardworking expedition members!

**HANCOCK:** I myself have come with a sacred relic of Reisen Temple. 'Twas passing fortunate that Senri's dango craving brought us to Kugane─we arrived precisely as Hancock was making his arrangements. Upon learning of your need, we made haste back to Hells' Lid─with our dango, never fear─and consulted with the other auspices. All consented to the lending of Tenzen's legendary Phoenix Blade for this noble cause. Suzaku and Seiryu were nevertheless worried that it might be lost in transit, however, and insisted upon accompanying me to Onokoro, where I had intended to entrust it to our Confederate allies. I thought instead to give it over to Hancock when we chanced to cross paths yet again, but alas, Seiryu remained ill at ease, and ordered me see the blade into your hands personally “or die trying”... I myself have come with a sacred relic of the Kojin. Upon learning of your need, Bunchin bade me deliver it on behalf of the Blue with all haste. Fearing I could not swim here with the necessary speed, however, I thought to beg our Confederate allies for aid. To my delight, Hancock was already preparing for departure at the selfsame port, and had space for additional cargo.

**ALPHINAUD:** We did, of course, need quite the impressive vessel to get it all here in time. Fortunately, our Majestic associates have been more than helpful. “'Tis an honor to join the Warrior of Light on another adventure,” they tell me!

**HANCOCK:** That is all wonderful to hear, but what of the extraordinary cost? I shudder to think of the ransom we must pay for such a bounty...

**ALPHINAUD:** Fret not for your coinpurse, young Alphinaud! Lord Lolorito looks ever towards the profits of the future, and thus the East Aldenard Trading Company went to some lengths to reduce the financial liability. And since the Scions funded the entire venture, not a gil need be rendered up in compensation. Everything is already yours!

**TATARU:** We funded the venture? When...?

**ALISAIE:** (-???-)Muahahaha! (-???-)Don't let the name fool you─this *coinkeeper* knows a thing or two about spending. When it comes to capital investiture, a sprinkling of gil here and there will not do! You need enough savings to make waves when it really counts...which is why frugality is paramount. We also had the benefit of a generous patron─“generous” being rather an understatement... She has supported us from the shadows since the very founding of the Scions, ere we even had coffers to fill...

**FOURCHENAULT:** Mother!?

**AMELIANCE:** Ameliance...

**TATARU:** I remain, of course, an entirely neutral party. I simply thought our family's coffers were needlessly full. We can hardly take them with us on your “teeny-tiny toy boat,” now, can we? And 'twould be a shame to leave all that hard-earned wealth unspent. Waste not!

**THANCRED:** Waste not!

**KRILE:** How ever did you manage so much in so short a time, though? We expected word to reach only a fraction of our allies...

**ALISAIE:** Did I not tell you I have my ways?

**ERENVILLE:** Erenville!? You were involved, too?

**CID:** I received a letter from Krile after we parted ways in Labyrinthos. She explained what the Scions were trying to accomplish, and why you might soon require the services of the gleaners, spread across the world as we are. I pray you do not interpret this as a betrayal of Sharlayan. I accept that the Forum's aim in pushing us to our limits was to preserve what knowledge we have, and I bear you no ill will for it. Yet, in collecting that knowledge, what I came to appreciate most about our star is that there remains so much we do not know. That is why I chose to help the Scions─to combat the obliteration of those countless undiscovered wonders. I held no illusions that they would be less demanding taskmasters...though rest assured, if I had, I would have been sorely disappointed. To make a long story short─the whole of the guildship cooperated to ensure your call was heard far and wide.

**GRAHATIA:** What's this about a ship that can fly to the moon? And why didn't you mention it sooner? The one time you don't beg my aid, your problem's a bloody ship that can fly to the moon!

**CID:** Cid! You brought the team!

**HOARYBOULDER:** Of course! Garlond Ironworks' finest. You need only point us towards my new favorite ship... Oh, I nearly forgot. We stopped by Werlyt before coming here and picked up a package from Gaius. He's still of the mind that actions make for better penance than words─contrite or otherwise─so he offered none of the latter. What he sent is an Allagan relic Valens used in his Weapons experiments─has a fair bit of refined adamantite in it, too.

**ESTINIEN:** As you like as not suspect, we've also brought adamantite from Mor Dhona's Dalamud shard. I admit to some consternation upon first receiving Krile's message. So few Scions remain at the Rising Stones now─far too few for such an expedition. However, the gleaners were able to secure us reinforcements, Idyllshire's treasure hunters not least among them. And ho, how the gobbieflock fought! Slowfix's gratitude for the safe return of his daughter has not waned, and he gathered his kin to our side with an astounding quickness. The clash between their machina and the Allagan defenses was a sight to behold. I wager even you would have been impressed by the magnitude of the gobbiebooms!

**VARSHAHN:** Fascinating as all this is, I fail to see how it explains your presence here. Does Radz-at-Han not have more pressing concerns?

**NIDHANA:** We do─yet averting the Final Days would be the most expedient solution. That, and I am indebted to you. Though they chose to take their leave of Thavnair, those you saved in Garlemald remain my people. My gratitude is beyond words. 'Tis appropriate that I aid you in kind. If in the doing we bring salvation to others of this star, so much the better. You will recall that I spoke of my father, Midgardsormr, and his journey across the great expanse. As he traveled betwixt the stars, his resplendent scales drank of the aether in those nigh-empty surrounds, and imparted to him the strength to persevere... Thinking they might further your cause, I called out to my kin for consent. Azdaja's answer was silence, as ever. Tiamat and Hraesvelgr, however, responded favorably to the suggestion. My sire, too, stirred from his slumber long enough to speak and say, “Very well...” My sire, too, gave his assent. Thus have I brought you his own wyrmscales. Fit them to your purpose, and seek a worthier fate for us all.

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** You'd be hard-pressed to find someone else so familiar with the unique properties of dragon scales, so I invited myself along.

**BARNIER:** Bugger me, this is so unbelievable I've gone right back round to believin' it again! Forget a six percent gain in efficiency. With all these goodies, we could get seven─no, ten─no! *Fourteen* bleedin' percent! Think of how far we could go─what we could do with that much power! What we could blow up! 

**ALISAIE:** If Kokkol is duly convinced, then it must be true─in which case, the Scions' end of the bargain has been fulfilled. Would you not agree?

**FOURCHENAULT:** Yes, Father?

**ALPHINAUD:** I know not what you seek of Hydaelyn, nor for what purpose you would take command of our ship. Yet this much is certain─to do so will be to dictate the fate of this star and the lives upon it. The lives of each and every creature. In their magnitude and their fragility. Do you understand, and are you prepared?

**FOURCHENAULT:** We have seen and we have felt how much each life shapes this world. And so we are determined to abandon none. We understand what is at stake, and we are prepared to bear this burden.

**ALISAIE:** Report if displayed. Then I... I will bear it with you. I beg you─share your struggles with me. As family. You grasped my fingers with such tiny hands the day you were born. I thought my heart might burst. 'Twas love and happiness beyond expression. Overwhelming. And a conviction so powerful that I trembled with something close to rage. I had heard the Final Days foretold. I swore to myself then and there that I would not let them steal your futures. The great exodus would succeed. Must succeed. No sacrifice or sin was worse than the alternative. If anything gave me pause...'twas mine own father. The Archon Louisoix openly decried Sharlayan's policies, a perspective which I regarded with increasing disdain as I grew older. Yet even as part of me thought him a fool... Perhaps I also hoped that he, of all people, would devise a brilliant means to save my children. A naive hope─but stubborn enough that I could never bring myself to keep you apart. No, that was his doing, when he perished at Carteneau. As we pulled that twisted slab of Dalamud from the sea, I remembered the warmth of your newborn touch. Chastened, I vowed never again to suffer any interference in my mission to protect you. No matter that you yourselves wished otherwise. Detest me. Fight me tooth and nail. I would suffer it and more and be satisfied so long as I could force you onto the ship. I was wrong. You two have grown so much stronger, and so much wiser, than I dared dream. You have earned the right to walk your own path...and already begun to do so.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Good! Because there are things we care about, and people we love...and none of them is replaceable. Not a one.

**ALPHINAUD:** It cannot have been an easy journey, for you to have come so far.

**AMELIANCE:** We shall be glad to acquaint you with the finer details someday, once this danger has passed. All that we have seen and heard. That we have felt and learned in our travels. Ours is not a kind world, but it is beautiful. Always.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Oh no, are you quite sure that's wise? After all, *someone* turns pale and flees the room when he sees so much as an envelope containing word of your adventures. What ever will happen if he learns what you were really up to?

**ALPHINAUD:** Ameliance!

**ALISAIE:** Report if displayed.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Report if displayed.

**GRAHATIA:** Though I have wronged my children most gravely, I owe you an apology as well. I assumed that it was the Scions' influence that made them so keen to charge headlong into danger. ...Yours, in particular. I see now that said influence instead brought them together with the many fine people gathered here today. In which case...I hope you continue to guide them.

**ALPHINAUD:** If we've finished loitering about the harbor, might I suggest we put our plans into motion? People are beginning to look confused.

**000:** Perhaps you can spare a few words ere they resume the tedious lugging of cargo? You've no small number of friends and admirers here, after all.

**SICARD:** What will you say? Lend us your strength! Our moment of triumph is close at hand! With me!

**EMMANELLAIN:** Damn right!

**HANCOCK:** Brilliant!

**SOROBAN:** Huzzah!

**ERENVILLE:** Very good!

**CID:** Aye!

**HOARYBOULDER:** Finally!

**NIDHANA:** Huzzah!

**FOURCHENAULT:** Wonderful!

**AMON:** Your assistance is appreciated. Now, in an orderly fashion, if you please!

**ALPHINAUD:** So bold, so headstrong. Stubborn to the last. But this is as far as you go. Oblivion beckons! Lies...all lies... Your dreams, your hopes, your futures... Delusions and lies! Report if displayed. My very essence...begins to wane. Sweet, sweet agony...

**AMON:** Leave this to her.

**000:** Come to deal the coup de grâce? Good... Watching you struggle against the inevitable is bad comedy. Erase me from existence, soul and all.

**AMON:** What will you say? Have you any memories of Meteion? Do you recall your days as Hermes?

**ASAHI:** How would you know that name? Report if displayed. Then it was you─in Elpis, with Emet-Selch. Ha! The final pieces fall into place. In my halcyon days as the mortal Amon, I was haunted by a dream... Night after night, the faceless multitude. The voiceless cries. Shards of shattered memories. But slowly the fog began to clear. This was Elpis, and I...I was Hermes. Recurring though it was, I paid this dream little heed. It was only when I was granted the seat─and memories─of Fandaniel that I knew these visions to be true. They were the memories of Hermes, that he himself erased using the power of Kairos. Or so he thought. In his attempt to burn away the events of that fateful day, he succeeded only in searing them more deeply into his soul. My soul. Death failed to expunge them, no matter how many times it came. Rebirth after rebirth, from one Fandaniel to the next. I wonder─is Emet-Selch adrift somewhere in this aetherial sea, in defeat finally remembering your time together in Elpis? How it must gall him─to be entrusted with knowledge of the Final Days, only to be rendered powerless to act upon it! So many lifetimes dedicated to restoring his beloved Amaurot in blissful ignorance. Oh, folly. But make no mistake... My life as Hermes is not the reason I invited the world's end. I have lived. I have struggled. I have dredged the very depths of despair. And in the detritus of existence, I found the truth. I served a great ruler, powerful beyond measure, the world his dominion. Yet even he and his vast empire were destined to fall─to become one with oblivion. At the end of life's journey...lies only death. So I ask you─why live at all? We betray, we torment, we murder. We are wicked, spiteful creatures─without exception! If life is so sacred, so precious, why fill it with such misery? Man wallows in a hell of his own making, without purpose or meaning. To live is to suffer... And I would end that suffering by my own hand! It matters not if it flies in the face of all believed right and just. Death is the only solution! That is my truth. My answer to the question, and yet... ...Even as the words pass my lips, I am filled with doubt. Has my search reached its end? Was this the only way? After all these years... Is this the answer I was hoping for?

**ALPHINAUD:** (-???-)The lamentations of the damned... How it vexes me, to see your conviction falter at the last. (-???-)Fandaniel... Still clinging to existence, I see. (-???-)You, who champion death so fervently, unwilling to accept your own. Refusing to be purified and swept into the sea of souls─as do I. (-???-)We prisoners to memory, watching as the world turns... (-???-)Though unlike me, you will be spared the ignominy of having your corpse made a puppet, dancing to another's tune.

**ASAHI:** Is that...Asahi?

**000:** How very astute. But let me be clear─I have not come to consort with the likes of you. Nor have I come to bemoan the state of the world following my untimely demise. In fact, I delight in mankind's downfall and the anguish it brings the savior of the savages. If I played some small part in the chaos, all the better. Not that I was in any position to resist. But to be made accomplice to the betrayal of Lord Zenos... ...I would die a thousand deaths to exact my vengeance! Now you are at my mercy. I shall drag us both into oblivion, and you will never see the fulfillment of your magnum opus! Even should you be reborn, your desperate search for answers must start again!

**AMON:** What will you say? I'll do what must be done. ... Next time, we will find the answer together.

**ASAHI:** Heh... And what might that be? My wish is all but granted─to die and take you all with me. Report if displayed. Even here. Even now... You have every right to hate me. For the fool I was, for the monster I became. But I will not beg forgiveness. The tale of Hermes─the man who knew so much, yet understood so little─ends here.

**ALPHINAUD:** Don't try to follow me. I had more of you people than I could stomach in life, never mind in death.

**ASAHI:** Likewise. I pray we do not meet again.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hmph. You had better hope not.

**HYDAELYN:** Come. Hydaelyn is waiting.

**000:** Brave travelers, I welcome you.

**HYDAELYN:** What will you say? We meet again, Venat. You look...different.

**ALISAIE:** Report if displayed. I see... Thou didst journey unto Elpis. And now, the rivers of time converge. I know why you have come, yet I would hear you speak your reasons, all the same.

**HYDAELYN:** You created the moon to deliver mankind from the Final Days. But is that really how it has to end? We do not wish to abandon this world. We want to protect the Source, and all of its shards!

**ALISAIE:** To flee is but one of two paths. The other leadeth to Meteion, far beyond the stars, where she doth chant creation's requiem. Her domain is formed of dynamis. Pure. Absolute. Where emotion and memory govern all, aether will avail you naught. Meteion hath gathered the pain and despair of countless stars, and to go unprepared is to go unto your doom.

**HYDAELYN:** We'll beat her. We'll win. I swear it! ...Is what I might've said, once. After everything I've seen, all the times I've succumbed to my own anger and fear... ...I can no longer pretend that courage and faith will be enough. But are we truly so powerless? That our only choice is to flee?

**ALPHINAUD:** Far from it, my child. Long ago, the inhabitants of myriad stars─many more prosperous than Etheirys─sought to free their worlds from life's woes. Sorrow and anger, conflict and hostility, despair...and even death itself. But as Meteion reported, every attempt ended in failure. Darkness abideth within every living being, and can never be cast out. Neither reason nor faith can challenge this immutable truth. To live is to suffer. And in suffering find strength, and purpose. And hope. As you have done so many times before. Thou dost pursue an impossible dream, yet knowing this, you pursue it nevertheless. And thou hast learned to depend on others, as they do thee. Thy yearning for the power to save the powerless hath ever driven thee to greater heights. Thou hast grown strong. Though those closest to thee no longer walketh by thy side, their love remaineth thy guiding light. For duty's sake, thou hast been bound by truths unutterable, time and time again. Yet thy heart hath never wavered, as thy companions will attest. In thy pursuit of mysteries great, all thou believest is brought into question. Undaunted, thy thirst for knowledge remaineth unquenched. The fires of hatred that once burned in thy heart burneth no more. From their ashes doth spring the light of love, warm and pure. As witness to black calamity, thou despaired at man's helplessness. Resolved, thou didst unite a distant world on the brink of collapse. And thou...my champion. When all did seem lost, thou never abandoned hope. For every trial and every foe that did bar thy way, thou hast proven equal to the challenge, drawing courage from the many bonds forged on thy journey. You have all known despair, and though the end approacheth, you walk on, heads held high. Therein lieth your power. The strength to silence the song of oblivion.

**HYDAELYN:** Then there is a means to confront her?

**ESTINIEN:** Yes, if you should prove yourselves worthy. Hark... Nigh impossible is it to send mortals to the edge of the universe. Should you fail, there will be no second chance. As the will of the star, I ask of you this... Do you possess the fortitude to stand firm when all around you doth crumble? Do you possess the faith to vanquish despair itself? Should you lack the strength to best a supreme deity, I cannot allow you to make the journey. You must leave this star and never return. Prepare yourselves!

**THANCRED:** Prove ourselves worthy, eh? Sounds straightforward enough.

**URIANGER:** Aye, no room for confusion there... In any case, we've come too far to back down now.

**YSHTOLA:** I am of the same mind. What power I have, I shall bring to bear.

**GRAHATIA:** The three of you seem to be forgetting who we're up against... It's not every day we battle a divine being of untold power. Well, not quite every day. Do try not to get underfoot. Needless to say, there'll be no margin for error.

**ALISAIE:** Let us hold nothing back! For the people of this world and those beyond the rift!

**ALPHINAUD:** Report if displayed.

**HYDAELYN:** Report if displayed.

**ALISAIE:** Alas, the question I posed to thee in Elpis hath remained unanswered these long years. I would hear thy response, Warrior of Light, shouldst thou emerge victorious! I, the last of my kind, shall test thee. Come, prove thy worth! At last...man has the strength to...

**HYDAELYN:** No! This can't be happening!

**YSHTOLA:** Hmmm. Though my power is in constant flux, I have always kept a reserve for this very moment. It was a true test of your prowess. You have done well.

**HYDAELYN:** There is one thing I must ask. By sundering the world into fourteen shards, the aether of all living beings too was divided. This reduction would in theory allow us to more easily interact with dynamis. Having seen mankind brought to the very precipice of extinction, you wished for us to develop a means to overcome despair. You believed we had the potential, and sundered all creation to see it fulfilled. To deliver us to that swirling maelstrom of dynamis in which our foe hides, and grant us the power to defeat her once and for all. Is this not true?

**ALPHINAUD:** It is as thou sayest. 'Twas the trial to which I subjected mankind, and it hath led to untold bloodshed and suffering. There was no kindness nor justice in the tragedy I wrought. When confronted with the almighty Zodiark, my only recourse was to rend Him and the world asunder, that His power be diminished for a time. And so it came to pass. Now you, my chosen, have surpassed my expectations. Surpassed me. I entrust the fate of the universe...unto you. This crystal contains the memory of Meteion's passage through the stars. Deliver it unto the Loporrits. They will guide you to her.

**HYDAELYN:** Though they may be capable of crossing great distances, there is a vast difference between traveling to the moon and the furthermost reaches of the great expanse. And unlike Meteion, we cannot simply soar on waves of dynamis to our destination.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed. To make such a journey would require an astronomical amount of aether. But a solution lieth close at hand.

**HYDAELYN:** Of course!

**000:** Yes, my child. Ever since I became the will of the star, the aether drawn here hath slowly crystallized. They who have answered my call know it well. While I have remained hidden, it hath become the embodiment of the planet's will in my place. A faceless, omnipotent force of nature. The Mothercrystal...our final hope. Alas, I can do no more. The fulfillment of this task doth fall to you, my chosen. Now, heed these words. Darkness and Light. Despair and hope. As goeth one, so goeth the other. Become Light. Become hope. I have a gift for thee... Come closer. Long have I searched for a means to safeguard the future of this star. Though I knew failure after failure, by recalling thy tales─and my promise to thee─I found the strength to carry on. Though the world is ever changing, thy thirst for adventure hath never waned. Thine unshakable resolve never ceaseth to amaze. To inspire. As a mark of my gratitude, I bestow this final gift. Thou dost possess the crystal of Azem, yes? As Hydaelyn, I preside over the forces of stasis, tranquility, peace. The laws which impart stability to existence itself. I will weave this selfsame power into the crystal, granting thee mastery over matter, to give form to the formless. Use it wisely, for it will not last indefinitely. As thou hast seen on thy journey through the aetherial sea, souls are drawn to thee. Mayhap this trait will prove to be a boon rather than a hindrance... It is thy hopes and prayers that enable Azem's invocations and give them life, so keep them close. But pray, remember this... When the way forward is hidden even from the mind's eye, look not to the invocation, but within yourself. These were the words of the crystal's original bearer. With that...my work is finished. Fulfill our promise. Right the wrongs committed when the world was yet whole. Silence the song of oblivion... Teach her a brighter melody. Show her...our journey is far from over.

**HYDAELYN:** What will you say? Thank you, Hydaelyn. We will find our way, Venat.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** It is I who should thank thee. For all thou hast done...and may yet accomplish. Long after I have gone, though not even my soul remaineth... My love will be with you forever, my dearest children. Report if displayed. Of this, I have no doubt. For yours is a light brilliant beyond measure. Long after I have gone, though not even my soul remaineth... My love will be with you forever, my dearest children.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**THANCRED:** Your business with Tataru is finished? My, what a thoughtful surprise. Whatever would we do without her?

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed. And she's right, you know─it hasn't been all doom and gloom.

**URIANGER:** It feels like a lifetime ago that Master Louisoix gathered us together to form the Circle of Knowing. Since then, we have experienced much. But rather than feeling wiser, the more I learn, the more I find my knowledge lacking.

**YSHTOLA:** Forsooth. As a student, vainly did I believe that I held the secrets of creation in my grasp. Yet that which I had seized was but an insignificant sliver of what awaited in the wider world. Every encounter, every experience, hath served to open mine eyes, enlightening and humbling me in equal measure. Even from those whom I called enemies have I learned many a valuable lesson.

**THANCRED:** What will we learn at the edge of the universe, I wonder...

**000:** Ultima Thule, where the bringer of the end makes her nest... I for one can't possibly imagine. But whatever awaits us there, we will survive. We *must*... For her.

**THANCRED:** What will you say? You've nothing left to prove. Not to Ryne. Nor Minfilia. We'll get through this. Together. Just make sure you bring enough ammunition.

**URIANGER:** ...

**THANCRED:** Is aught the matter?

**YSHTOLA:** No, it's nothing. I just... Well, lately I find myself surprised at how much I've changed. How much we've all changed.  Haha Gods, it feels like only yesterday that we went on that mission to Drybone. We've both changed much since then, have we not? O ye of little faith. I know better than to leave home without ample supplies, thank you very much─I didn't pick up the gunblade yesterday. And to think I used to prefer fighting from the shadows. Gods, I really have changed.

**THANCRED:** [AMUSED LAUGH] Report if displayed. We've come far together, and if we have aught to say about it, we'll go further still. Aye, we will avert this calamity and return home. In preparation for which, we must give thought to what we hope to achieve after the proverbial dust has settled.

**YSHTOLA:** What with the primals and Ascians all but dealt with, I suppose we'll need to look for new hobbies. In all seriousness, though─in uniting to overcome a common foe, the disparate peoples of the world have found a way forward together. It's a truly gratifying sight to see.

**THANCRED:** Indeed... Though it was many years in the making, we have successfully set in motion the gears of fundamental change. With this, we have fulfilled our humble role as a symbol of hope...and I daresay it is time to bow out. After all, there is no shortage of hands to bear the torch in our stead.

**URIANGER:** You know, I never really considered I might live long enough to see an after. But even if my time as a Scion came to an end, I don't expect that much would change. Traveling the world, going wherever the wind blows, lending a hand to those in need...

**THANCRED:** A journey for journey's sake. It doth suit thee well. I must confess, I too have yearned to see more of the world. If thou art amenable to the suggestion, I would accompany thee. Mine ability to affect an air of normalcy through artful disguise is much improved, thou must concede...

**YSHTOLA:** Aye, well, improvement is relative. You still look suspicious no matter what you wear. What of you, Y'shtola? Any grand plans?

**THANCRED:** Why, continue my quest for knowledge, naturally. To begin with, I wish to know the state of the reflections, to which end I must find a means to travel between worlds. 'Tis the least I must do if I am to keep my promise. Should my pursuits prove unduly arduous, I won't hesitate to call on you. And in return, I will take you to see Ryne one day. I'm sure you cannot wait to see the fine young woman she has become.

**URIANGER:** Spare me...

**WAITEROFTHELASTSTAND:** And what of thee? What wouldst thou pursue at duty's end?

**THANCRED:** Here's yours. My apologies for the wait.

**URIANGER:** Well, shall we make a toast? To victory.

**YSHTOLA:** To our comrades.

**KRILE:** To the future of the star.

**GRAHATIA:** Oh?  [LAUGH] Report if displayed. Knowing them, they're probably dreaming about the celestial adventures to come. Just as well. They've been running themselves ragged of late. Unlike you and the others, I'm a few steps removed from the danger and excitement. The things you all get up to never fail to impress me. But by the same token, I can't help but worry. Not only for your safety, but...but for your happiness. After everything you've sacrificed, you earned it a thousand times over. From the simple pleasures of tucking into a hearty meal or...or collapsing into a comfortable bed... To the grand triumphs of visiting legendary lands or finding true love─you deserve all the joy in the world. There is so much that life has to offer. So much to be treasured and shared with those we hold dear. So promise me this: come what may, you won't give up on your own happiness. When you're out there, fighting tooth and nail, it's all too easy to forget. But in the end, your passions will be your greatest strength of all. Remember that.

**KRILE:**  [GRUMBLE] Report if displayed. Hm... This feels...familiar... Well, 'tis good to be... Wait, what are you─? What am I─? Gods, don't tell me I fell asleep?

**GRAHATIA:** Not that there's any shame in it...but you were sleeping like babies.

**ALISAIE:** Ugh... How embarrassing...

**KRILE:** Not a word to anyone. Understood? Not. One. Word.

**ALISAIE:** I'm told that sleeping in proper beds of your own choosing is a much more effective way to prepare for battle.

**GRAHATIA:** [GRUMBLE] Report if displayed. 

**KRILE:** So...what were the two of you doing here?

**GRAHATIA:** I had a few books to return to the library. Thought I'd take care of it while I could.

**000:** And you?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? It's a secret. Just enjoying a little peace and quiet. Nothing in particular.

**ESTINIEN:** Oh? What brings you here? Ah, so you were worried that the Leveilleur household might again be gripped by turmoil.   All is well, I assure you. In my letters home, I had made mention of Estinien, you see. My mother wished to meet the legend in person, and so we arranged to have a spot of tea together.

**ALPHINAUD:** Where were you in my hour of need? Fell beasts I can face, but I'm not made for idle chitchat with lords and ladies...

**ESTINIEN:** Well, I for one thought you held your own. Mother was the picture of delight.

**ALPHINAUD:** Hmph. I might've been delighted myself were we in a tavern with more agreeable drink. The thought of fleeing crossed my mind, but what then? I'd never hear the end of it─least of all from Tataru.

**ESTINIEN:** I'm sorry... 'Twas not my intent to cause you such distress. It's just...it was one of the things I didn't want to leave undone ere we set forth. That's not to say I think we won't be returning... Yet given what lies ahead, I did not wish to leave for later that which I could do today. After all, tomorrow is never promised.

**ALPHINAUD:** It's fine. Not like I had better things to do. Besides...seeing you with your mother brought back fond memories of my own. Be we rich or poor, family is...family. Well, it's past time we were on our way.

**ESTINIEN:** Wait! Since I left home, I've made a great many mistakes. Mistakes for which I can never make amends. But through it all, you didn't give up on me. To have returned here, with you at my side... It means more to me than you know. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart.

**ALPHINAUD:**  

**ESTINIEN:** Forgive me, but it needed to be said.

**000:** I'm the one who owes you thanks. Were it not for you, I would not be alive today, nor come to terms with Nidhogg's spirit. I am ever grateful.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? I suppose I ought to thank you both as well. You were never one to forsake a friend, Alphinaud. I'll be counting on you.

**ESTINIEN:** Well, we needn't make it a competition. You know... This must be what Hydaelyn meant when She spoke about depending on one another. However treacherous the road before us, together we will prevail.   No, I'm not. And I'm proud of that.

**SYSTEM:**   I know, and I won't let you down. Together, we'll show the enemy the strength of mortal will.

**ZENOS:** That night, at the Royal Menagerie in Ala Mhigo...

**SYSTEM:** (-Zenos viator Galvus-) “You will never get what you want...not even the battle you pine for so dearly...” (-Zenos viator Galvus-)In that transcendent moment, what was it that I sought in you? (-Zenos viator Galvus-)And what was it that you sought in me?

**YSHTOLA:** And thus it dawns... The day of reckoning.

**THANCRED:** How often have we thus assembled... To combine our knowledge and seek solutions to the problems before us.

**URIANGER:** Back at the Waking Sands, it was all we could do to address the most minor of troubles. Who could've realized what we'd find when we began to look to the sources of the realm's woes.

**ALPHINAUD:** At the Rising Stones, we made great strides and shared many moments. From the joyous...to the sorrowful.

**GRAHATIA:** We've had occasion to call other places home too. Be it Ishgard or Kugane, we were fortunate to find sanctuary wherein we might take stock and continue our fight.

**ALISAIE:** I was honored to host this company in the Crystarium. To stand with you all as we confronted the truth of the star itself.

**KRILE:** And now, from this place, we go to fight the most important battle of all.

**YSHTOLA:** The Forum has sent word. The ark is ready. The Loporrits, naturally, will be commanding the vessel. They will see the eight of you to Ultima Thule. Upon arriving, your objective is to find and vanquish Meteion. As a final formality, the Forum bade me ascertain your resolve. So...are you certain you wish to do this?

**KRILE:** We are.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then ere you report to Thaumazein, I leave you with these words. You must triumph. What that means will differ for each of you. To make it back home, or to simply avert doom, or perhaps something else altogether... Yet whatever it is that drives you, I have faith in its power to see you through. So please─triumph. Triumph, as we who remain behind believe you will.

**TATARU:** Let us be off, then.

**000:** Wait! Both Krile and I will be there to see you off, but as your receptionist, I feel I need to say this here. Safe journey, all of you! And...be safe!

**FOURCHENAULT:** What will you say? You can count on it. You too, Tataru.

**CID:** All present and accounted for? Good. As you will have heard, the ark is ready. All that remains is to board and be on your way.

**GRAHATIA:** I've seen my fair share of tight schedules, but this was bloody murder... But we did it. We finished the ship. It's safe, fit for purpose, and looks good to boot. Aye, it's a Garlond through and through.

**CID:** I really don't know what we'd do without you. Thank you for everything.

**ALISAIE:** Don't mention it. Ever since that episode with Omega, I've been toying with the idea of starfaring vessels. And as they say, necessity is the mother of invention. We've learned a lot, let me tell you. Well, the work was hard, but we've learned a lot from it. After all, it's not every day you get tasked with building a starfaring vessel. In case you're wondering about payment, the ongoing existence of the world ought to do. But feel free to throw in a colorful recounting of your journey on your return. So, have you thought of a name?

**CID:** A name? Wasn't everyone just calling it Father's “teeny-tiny toy boat”?

**FOURCHENAULT:** Well, seeing as its purpose has changed, I thought a more eloquent name was in order. I suggested as much to Fourchenault, who seemed quite amenable to the idea.

**SICARD:** As you know, this vessel is the culmination of heretofore unprecedented collaboration. And though said collaboration is owed to the Scions, there is another whose noble deeds made our work possible. From a fragment of Dalamud, we obtained not only advanced materials such as refined adamantite, but the knowledge to traverse the stars. And this fragment would not have found its way to us had the Archon Louisoix not fought to protect this world─and in so doing laid down his life. Now that the vessel stands complete, I cannot help but wonder if it was more than mere happenstance... If it was my father's intention to guide us here. In the hopes that his guidance will see you all safely home, I name the vessel after that selfsame fragment of Dalamud he delivered unto us. The starship *Ragnarok*.

**ALPHINAUD:** Sorry for the wait! I got everyone you asked for, and not a one less.

**LIVINGWAY:** What are you all doing here?

**URIANGER:** Oh, I invited them. The representatives of those tribes with religious inclinations. You've done a fine job of readying the *Ragnarok*, but for it to take flight, we'll of course need the power of the Mothercrystal. Given its immense size, however, transporting it would be an absolute logistical nightmare. Not to mention we'd need to shatter it into tiny shards for feeding to the engines. But a brilliant idea came to me: we convert the crystal's energy into forms that can transport themselves!

**THANCRED:** [GASP] Report if displayed. Thou wouldst employ summoning...or should I say its precursor─creation magicks.

**URIANGER:** Care to explain for our benefit?

**ALPHINAUD:** As you may have witnessed at Bestways Burrow, the Loporrits are capable of creation magicks, which they use to shape the moon's environment. Yet simple though they make it seem, 'tis a highly advanced and exacting art. To perform it correctly requireth that the wielder holdeth the object in his mind's eye in clearest detail.

**URIANGER:** Hence the ancients' meticulous management of concepts.

**YSHTOLA:** Drawing upon this art, the Ascians conceived of summoning as we know it. A derivative that replaceth the complexity of concepts with the simplicity of zealotry to make manifest a creation.

**LIVINGWAY:** I see... By combining the Loporrits' magicks and the tribes' faith, we convert the Mothercrystal into primals of purer form and greater obedience. Summoning as it was intended, one might say.

**ALISAIE:** Indeed, indeed! While Hydaelyn gave us the ability to use creation magicks, She forbade us from using it to make anything possessed of a soul─or similar. She didn't say anything about fulfilling the desires of *others*, though. So! Borrowing our friends' faith, we'll create deities using the Mothercrystal's power, and send them to the *Ragnarok*!

**LIVINGWAY:** Am I the only one here concerned about the risk of being turned into a tempered minion?

**SOROBAN:** Oh, right, I was getting to that... From what I've read in Sharlayan tomes, it appears the Ascians incorporated an additional nasty element into their summoning method: the fervent desire to assimilate others into one's belief. Beings thus created are instilled with the selfsame desire, and use their powers to enthrall people─starting with the summoner. In contrast, our creation magicks─the original and the best, accept no substitutes─don't incorporate any of that rubbish, so there's no risk of tempering. I mean, if the being was on the scale of Zodiark, you might feel a little “tug”...but I think we'll be safe enough.

**SICARD:** Truth be told, I do not understand the intricacies of this plan. But none of us would ever turn our backs on you. When the avatars of our faith ran amok, you intervened without decrying we who birthed them. Where others vilified and suppressed us, you offered understanding and friendship. In gratitude, we will share with you the true expressions of our gods─not malevolent deities, but benevolent saviors!

**SOROBAN:** All right, you lot, we're headin' to the aetherial sea. Stay in sight else you're liable to get lost.

**WILFSUNN:** Lead the way!

**BLOEWYDA:** May we have a moment? In anticipation of the day man might journey to the stars, we developed these.

**URIANGER:** Portable teleportation devices. One for each of you, designed to work in tandem. Press the button on one, and in a matter of moments all eight will activate and send their owners back to the *Ragnarok*. There is no telling what hazards you may encounter. If you find yourselves separated or lost, please do not hesitate to use them. Be safe, all of you. And come back.

**LIVINGWAY:** You as well. I pray you take care.

**FOURCHENAULT:** Looks like everything is in order, so I'll go ahead and board. A few of my fellows will remain to assist with the summonings, but rest assured the vessel won't want for competent crewing.

**LIVINGWAY:** If you are ready, then you should board as well. Go...and godsspeed.

**ALPHINAUD:** Welcome to the bridge, everyone! I hope you have everything, because I can't be bothered turning back. Right then, make yourselves comfortable. We're setting off in just a moment.

**FOURCHENAULT:** It's...incredible...

**LIVINGWAY:** This is Fourchenault. Can you hear me? The preparations for the summonings are complete. In accordance with the fourteenth phase of the plan, we have moved the *Ragnarok* to the launch site. The gates are open. You may depart when ready.

**ALISAIE:** So...are we ready?

**MAPPINGWAY:** As ready as we'll ever be. Let's get going.

**000:** Oh, come on! A burnt-out star's got more fire in its belly! Try it again─with feeling!

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you do? Issue the command to launch. Have Alphinaud do the honors.

**ALISAIE:** Me!? B-But I...

**ALPHINAUD:** No need to be coy, Brother. Do it, and do it well!

**SLEEPINGWAY:** If you all insist... [CLEARS THROAT] Report if displayed. Onward─unto the distant stars and beyond! *Ragnarok*, engage!

**LIVINGWAY:** [SNORTS, STARTLED AWAKE] Report if displayed. E-Engage!

**MAPPINGWAY:** (-Loporrits-)Engage!

**SINGINGWAY:** Engage!

**GROWINGWAY:** Engage!

**GARUDA:** Engage!

**SUSANO:** That I must carry *landwalkers* into the sky... I cannot imagine a greater indignity!

**GARUDA:** Do not sulk so. For thy mighty winds exist not only to buffet and batter. Nay, they may serve also to thrust forth with vigor. Such is thy glory...and thus it is an occasion to rejoice! So come─let us revel!

**LIVINGWAY:**   So long as the wind blows freely, I suppose all is as it should be in creation... I will render unto them a storm, that they may pierce the firmament and fly free!

**SLEEPINGWAY:** Still in one piece. Good. Sleepingway, report.

**MAPPINGWAY:** All's well! Fantastic, even! Thanks to the power of those primals, the engines are roaring and we're ripping along!

**LIVINGWAY:** All values are also within projected ranges. Time to destination is eight carrots. Perhaps seven at a pinch.

**YSHTOLA:** All right, let's go over some points of caution. Our destination, as you know, is Ultima Thule. Lest you wonder, the place is not a star so much as...a patch of emptiness. That's the extent of what our equipment could determine, anyway. From what we know of Meteion, she's likely used dynamis to obfuscate her location.

**LIVINGWAY:** So in conclusion, we'll only know what's there when we get there.

**ALPHINAUD:** The crew and I will see to it the ship's ready to take off at a moment's notice. We'll support the search as best we can, but it'll be your paws on the ground...assuming there is any. But everything will be fine, I'm sure. Hydaelyn believes in you, so you ought to believe in yourselves. Just don't do anything I wouldn't. Like waiting too long to use those portable teleporters of yours. Personally, at the slightest sign of trouble, I'd mash the button to bits─and you should as well.

**MAPPINGWAY:** Understood. We promise to be careful.

**METEION:** I suggest you brace yourselves. We're about to arrive, and the vessel will shake a good bit. Hm? What is this? Something is interfering with the equipment...

**000:** (-???-)...Greetings. Greetings... Can you hear me...?

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? Meteion... It's her...the bringer of despair.

**METEION:** So this is Meteion... This is Meteion...

**ALISAIE:** Oh? Have you met one of my sisters? I don't remember meeting you myself... But I do know that you're from Etheirys. Why have you come? All you had to do was wait. I would've delivered to you your ends.

**METEION:** We didn't ask for that!

**YSHTOLA:** I don't understand. All life is destined to end. Why choose to prolong your suffering? Effort, ambition, love─they amount to naught. Happiness, should you find it, is inevitably lost. Stolen away by events beyond your control. There is no logic nor meaning in it. You think there is, convince yourselves, but it's all a cruel accident. Come now, I speak the truth. A truth you would recognize if you looked up at the night sky. Unbroken emptiness. Cold, dark, and silent. Your world, like every other, is but a blemish upon its perfect fabric. Life is an anomaly. It is unnatural and cannot continue. The sooner you accept this, the easier it will be.

**THANCRED:** Just to be clear, we're not here to argue with you. We know that life is fleeting. And that in the short time we have it, we're not assured happiness.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed, I've seen far more sorrow in the eyes of many I've met. I myself have plenty of regrets, and one day they'll die with me. Gone to dust with my “good” deeds and unfulfilled dreams.

**METEION:** But we accept this. That our existence may seem pointless. That sorrow, rage, and despair will always dog our heels. And we press on regardless. That is why Hydaelyn guided us here. In Her boundless love for mankind, She has prepared us for this trial, and in Her name we have come for you!

**ALISAIE:** Yes, I sense it... A burning passion, like unto fury... I know it well. For the same passion once burned in many a star before yours. Suffocated and extinguished now.

**METEION:** I...I can't...breathe.

**ESTINIEN:** You approach the bounds of my Ultimatum, where emotions dictate reality. Where resignation and acceptance unite to embrace the end. Where those who yet valiantly cling to life cannot thrive...

**URIANGER:** By the Fury...

**YSHTOLA:** Thancred...?

**MAPPINGWAY:** Meteion is gone as well. Mayhap he awakened first and gave chase.

**GROWINGWAY:** ...Uh, everyone? It appears we're at our destination. This...this is Ultima Thule.

**LIVINGWAY:** Not that we knew what to expect...but I wasn't expecting this. From atmospheric composition to ambient temperatures, all readings are within permissible range. This place is capable of supporting life!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** If that's the case, then Thancred may well have gone on ahead. Let's go and have a look. Meanwhile, I want the rest of you to perform a full inspection of the ship as well as a biological scan.

**EMETSELCH:** So it was that the brave wayfarers arrived at last at dream's end.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** In following their path walked and history written, I am made keenly aware of one truth... Though the curtains may fall again and again, so long as others take the stage, ever shall there be more tales to tell.

**EMETSELCH:** So let them bring it to a close, I say.

**GRAHATIA:** Let the curtains fall upon this─ The final chapter in the tale of the star.

**LIVINGWAY:** Is this...a dead star?

**YSHTOLA:** As I live and breathe...I live and breathe. The environment itself shouldn't kill us.

**ALISAIE:** Well then, let us search for Thancred while exploring the area. The ship, we leave in your care.

**METEION:** Dragons? Here?

**ALPHINAUD:** What you see is a memory of a world that once was. A world suffering a slow death, whose denizens cried out for the release of oblivion.

**METEION:** What? Their world...is dead?

**URIANGER:** It is. Not a single life remains upon that husk floating in the vast emptiness. These creatures are shadow and shade. Perpetuated only to suffuse dynamis with their unending lamentations.

**METEION:** Our friend Thancred─where is he?

**URIANGER:** A strange question. He is at your side, is he not? Oh yes─he is here, and there, and everywhere within this space. He would tell you himself if he had form to form words. Huh. Such loathing and uncertainty... You don't know why you still exist. In like manner to the oblivion I send, I tried to drown out your aether with dynamis. Beginning with this Thancred, who came at me despite being unable to breathe. Such a simple thing, unmaking men. In the blinking of an eye, he was gone. Didn't even have the chance to be transformed. Yet somehow, he managed to leave a sliver of himself behind. What you call...the heart...or perhaps the soul? In his final moment, he...cried out from it. A single word... “Survive...”

**METEION:**  

**ESTINIEN:** That wish proved stronger than the despair that ruled here. It overpowered it, causing this space to be remade. Into a place you can perceive, and where life can endure. That you draw breath is proof that his soul lives on. For how long, however, remains to be seen.

**METEION:** Well then, we should hurry and tend to business! Huh!?

**ESTINIEN:** It's futile. You will never reach the true me. I told you. Emotions dictate reality in this space. Such changes as you might work will not alter its nature. You may see, but you cannot touch. Walk, but not advance.

**GRAHATIA:** Bah...

**URIANGER:** Meteion holds too much sway here. How do we contend with a foe who can unmake us on a whim?

**YSHTOLA:** I do not know...but Thancred gave his life that we might come this far. We must press on.

**URIANGER:** Agreed. We cannot turn tail here. Not without something to show for our comrade's sacrifice.

**ALPHINAUD:** He remaineth as he was when I first approached. Entombed in melancholy.

**ESTINIEN:** I see... Perhaps I could─

**TIREDDRAGON:** I'll handle this. So. Waiting to die like all the others, are you?

**ESTINIEN:** Aye. Our pride is crushed, and our souls corrupted. The winds are stilled, and the heavens offer no comfort. There is nothing left for our kind. Our long lives a curse as we await the end. Still as stone we shall become...

**TIREDDRAGON:** So you say, yet your kind has found a new beginning on our star. One of you braved the expanse, bearing with him a clutch of eggs. They and their children now rule our skies, their song heard by all.

**ESTINIEN:** Our kin...on another star? And yet...upon thee do I smell the blood of my brethren. Were they drawn into discord and war on their new home?

**TIREDDRAGON:** They were. They suffered much, and repaid their suffering in kind.

**ESTINIEN:**   It mattereth not whither we fly. Ever will a sanguine ocean await us. Ever will retribution's wheel turn. And so, on the last of my pride as a dragon, I break free of this wheel. I renounce conflict! Exile myself from the other, never again to be touched by the flames of hatred!

**ALPHINAUD:** Had your brethren made the selfsame choice, my family might still be alive. Yet lasting peace does not come to those who simply retreat from conflict. No, you must be willing to confront it. To stare into the face of your foe...and see yourself in him. Only then can you break the cycle of torment and tragedy. This lesson, a dear friend taught me at the risk of his life. There is no nobility in your “penance.” You wallow in self-pity. And after everything we've endured, we will not let you stop us!

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien!

**TIREDDRAGON:** Stay back!

**ESTINIEN:** We tire of war... We tire of turmoil... Dignity tarnished, crimson stained... Our misery, our shame... Too much to bear... Release us, from war... From life...

**ALISAIE:** I see... Theirs is the emotion that bars our way. Hmph. The rest is up to you.

**GRAHATIA:** No... Not Estinien too...

**ALPHINAUD:** There's a wind...

**ALISAIE:** He's opened the way for us... Sacrificed himself to remake this place, like Thancred did...  

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, Alphinaud...

**YSHTOLA:** Come...let us follow the wind. It will not lead us astray. He would not.

**EAA:** Please, continue. Tell us about this truth you discovered.

**EAB:** Very well. Bear in mind, however, that the purpose of this conversation is not to impart scholarly knowledge. For such requires that you comprehend the subject matter─which you will not. We will forgo the intricacies of our scientific methodology and deal only with the conclusion─the end of our society, and our world.

**YSHTOLA:** We acknowledge, with regret, that your star is in the midst of the same panic-induced cataclysm that befell Deneb III. As such, in order to avoid causing undue distress, we will refrain from explicitly stating how much time you have remaining.

**EAA:** You are entirely too kind. I pray you recount your tale as you see fit.

**EAB:** In the beginning, the universe was but a tiny particle. Then suddenly, this particle began to expand. Having remained entirely in the bounds of your star, the phenomenon may be difficult for your kind to grasp, but this expansion has since continued unabated.

**EAA:** Speculating that the universe could not grow indefinitely, we sought to learn what might occur─and made a worrying discovery. The stars will continue to spread apart, as will their finite thermal energies. Eventually, all heavenly bodies will grow cold and freeze. No new stars will be born, and the universe will enter unto an eternal ice age.

**EAB:** In hopes of proving that this determination was erroneous, we scrutinized our research from all angles, even as we sought to avert the everlasting winter. The endeavor proved fruitless. So infamously so, in fact, that it became synonymous with vain effort. The universe as we know it would end, and there is no way to prevent it.

**EAA:** Beneath the weight of this knowledge, our society stagnated. Though we had time still, it was a “cold” comfort. Why strive for anything when desolation is assured? When our wealth of wisdom, accumulated since the dawning of our kind, would be forever lost? No civilization would rise from our ashes. No scholar recover our knowledge. In silence unbroken, naught would stir.

**EAB:** Intellect was once our pride. Overnight, it became our shame. Our works monuments to futility. Immortality, our greatest invention, became a source of suffering. Rather than suffer on, many chose to unmake themselves by means of aetheric exsanguinaters. Etched upon these stones are the testaments of such souls. Though many left no words at all, thinking it a pointless gesture.

**EAA:** Once we have obtained vessels of flesh, we likewise intend to vanish.

**YSHTOLA:** If you understand this─understand aught of our tale─you will abandon your quest for knowledge. Ignorance truly is bliss. If you would cling to your illusory happiness, remain primitive and pure. It is the only way.

**EAA:**   So that's your story. While I appreciate your advice, I will not heed it. Convinced though you may be of this truth, it is yours and not mine. Indeed truth, I have ever believed, is in the eye of the beholder.

**YSHTOLA:** Are you suggesting that we have reached a faulty conclusion? That our science failed us?

**ALISAIE:** Hardly. As you yourself said, the subject matter is beyond my comprehension. And that, I accept, is true. I do not possess the knowledge to prove or disprove your conclusion. In my mortal years, I doubt I could even approach the wisdom of the Ea. But of one thing am I absolutely certain: I would *not* be happier in ignorance.

**YSHTOLA:** Y'shtola, no! You mustn't!

**EAA:** The most important lesson I've learned...is that learning isn't simply passing one's eyes over words. Nay... 'Tis when understood for oneself that knowledge attains its true value. This is what has sustained me. Driven me onward in joy and wonder. In anger and sorrow. The universe may end, and all may be for naught. But I will live as I always have. I will always seek out new knowledge. And no conclusion of yours, no matter how grim, can dampen my desire.

**EAB:** I suppose it is only to be expected. Their feeble minds cannot fathom the terrifying gravity of it all.

**YSHTOLA:** But worry not. We consider it our duty to enlighten you, and we will not stop until you grasp the full extent of our despair!

**URIANGER:** Keep calm, and listen well. Though my body will soon dissipate, there may be a way to restore it. Azem's magick. So long as our souls remain, you can use it to summon us back. But you mustn't, for it would mean losing our way forward. This, I only reveal so that you can promise not to invoke the magick. We came here knowing what victory may cost, so press on. Press on, and do not look back.

**YSHTOLA:** I shall join thee. As subterfuge is not required, thou shalt not suffer for mine absence.

**URIANGER:** Urianger... 

**YSHTOLA:** My resolve hath never been as strong as thine. Full oft have I wavered in my decisions, and afterwards been stricken with regret. In spite of this, I may still stand with my comrades, supporting them as they attempt the greatest of feats. This truth, I have learned in the course of our journey. And many though my shortcomings may be, I may also claim to excel in prophecies. My studies into which have granted me the flexibility of mind needed to bend this malleable reality. Thus shall I hope... That thou mayest have the strength to resist, and our comrades the strength to continue.

**METEION:** With you to urge us on, how could we possibly fail?

**ALISAIE:** What's this? An extinguished civilization...rekindled?

**METEION:** That's right! Our quest doesn't end here. We'll press on...and we *will* find you!

**GRAHATIA:** There. That's where you'll find me.

**METEION:** Is that...another star?

**ALISAIE:** Of the stars we visited, most were already devoid of life. And where there was life still, the inhabitants wished for death. But even death, we learned, isn't truly the end. It is but a part of the cycle of rebirth. Souls return to the star─or in its absence, a larger flow. And eventually they are reborn. Alive again, to know suffering anew... True salvation lies not in dying. It lies in not being born. This is the gift I would give to you. To all life on beautiful Etheirys. To that end, we created an egg wherein life cannot quicken─that dead sun. Attain it if you can. Before your friends' emotions fade away─along with their protection.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, I'm out of ideas...

**GRAHATIA:** As am I. Operating such consoles is trying enough, but if we can't even activate it...

**ALISAIE:** Perhaps there is a way. First, consider the world that has been recreated here. Its inhabitants were machines who gathered combat data to enhance themselves. And among the many wars they waged, the most notable was that against the dragons. As you've doubtless surmised, I believe this was the home world of Omega. Cid built a jamming device to defeat it. A device which generated massive bursts of lightning, its sole weakness. As you've doubtless surmised, I believe this was the home world of Omega. According to the records I read in the future, it possessed a single weakness: lightning. The significance of these details may be lost on you now, but they lead me to believe this was the home world of Omega. According to the records I read in the future, it possessed a single weakness: lightning. The significance of these details may be lost on you now, but they lead me to believe this was the home world of Omega. Aye, I speak of the ancient weapon. The one which the Alliance unleashed upon Shinryu. I will spare you the long story, but according to the records I read in the future, it possessed a single weakness: lightning.

**GRAHATIA:** That's all well and good, but what does that─ ...Wait, you're not thinking to strike the console with lightning, are you?

**ALPHINAUD:** As a matter of fact, I am. Ask yourselves this: why would an entity as puissant as Omega not be designed to suppress the effects of lightning?

**GRAHATIA:** Because it relies upon it─or something akin to it─as a source of energy.

**000:** My thoughts exactly. And there is a good chance the same is true of the Omicrons and their devices. So, shall I cast caution to the wind and try something reckless and dramatic?

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? Have at it! I'm not sure this is a good idea. Or I could use my custom-made Omega Jammer!

**ALISAIE:** Very well, here I go! Worry not, I will be careful. And if it fails, we can think of something else. You still have it!? Cid and Nero's legendary device, which brought low the superweapon Omega!? Wait... The actual device was much too big to lug around, so you must have only the control module. And there I was getting all excited... Never mind. An old-fashioned spell will suffice.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** It...it worked!

**GRAHATIA:** (-???-)Opening connection to Communications Module I... Connection established. (-Sir-)Transmission: strategic Matrix Stigma-1 now online. As the primary strategic matrix, you may address me as “Sir.” (-Sir-)Checking for new communications... None found. All units, please maintain current state. (-Sir-)End transmission. Closing connection...

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** Wait! We have questions for you! Of late, no mission orders have been issued. Why not? Has there been some manner of trouble?

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Sir-)Reply: the extended operations unit has yet to determine guidelines for future assignments. (-Sir-)All strategies are calculated, devised, and actioned in accordance with said guidelines. (-Sir-)In the interim, all citizens are directed to maintain a state of combat readiness. End reply. Awaiting query.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** Can you tell us why the extended operations unit hasn't yet determined the guidelines?

**ALPHINAUD:** (-Sir-)Unable to comply. Information unavailable or access restricted.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** In that case, is it possible for us to communicate directly with the unit?

**ALISAIE:** (-Sir-)...Access denied. Unable to establish connection.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** Is there anything you can tell us? Have there been any abnormalities, like a threat to the star or widespread unrest?

**GRAHATIA:** (-Sir-)Reply: negative. All citizens continue to operate at maximum efficiency. (-Sir-)If your operations are suboptimal, please proceed to a maintenance facility for evaluation. Otherwise, standby at your designated post. End reply. (-Sir-)End transmission. Closing connection...

**ALISAIE:** I could activate it again, but I doubt it would be productive. What do you think?

**ALPHINAUD:** If all the Omicrons really were running as efficiently as it claimed, then I doubt they were hoping for life here to end. As this Sir told us, there just haven't been any new instructions, and everyone is standing by.

**M017:** Should be standing by, at any rate. If there are those that are neglecting their duties, perhaps we can glean a clue from them. I propose we take another look around, and also try to find the operations unit.

**GRAHATIA:** As you have surmised, I am part of the shared intelligence of Stigma-1. It is─was my charge to determine the optimal path to achieving our prime function. This body had been abandoned by its former owner, and lay unused. I took it and abandoned my own─and with it my duty.

**M017:** May we ask why you did this? From what we gather, it seems to be a personal matter.

**ALISAIE:** Our kind did not always look as we do now. Long ago, we possessed frail and feeble bodies. Beleaguered by stronger races, our ancestors took to augmenting their flesh in order to defend themselves. What began with limited parts eventually spread to the whole body. And at last, a means was discovered to convert the mind into data, rendering even the brain obsolete. Such complete mechanical beings were called the Omicrons. And by their might, we came to reign supreme over the star. But even then, we did not feel secure. For we knew that the universe was home to civilizations aside from our own─civilizations that may be stronger still than us. Rather than risk becoming the subjugated, we chose to become the subjugator. We began our conquest of the stars, that we might acquire the resources and knowledge we needed to reign supreme. We were successful in that endeavor. So powerful did we become, we could lay low even the mighty dragons. But then something unexpected happened. I began experiencing an error: I could no longer determine an optimal path.

**M017:** You were malfunctioning?

**ALPHINAUD:** I performed numerous full system scans, each time finding no issues. Yet the error persisted... It was then that I speculated: what would happen if we grew so powerful as to have no equal? To become stronger was essential to our existence. Our every action has been in service to this objective. But if nothing lies beyond this, can it be truly said that it was essential? Have we been engaging only in wanton destruction?

**M017:** You could find no threat to justify your purpose.

**GRAHATIA:** The Omicrons will never leave this star. They will stand by until their reserves of energy are spent. For I have no path to offer them. None.

**M017:** It is not our place to pass judgment on the deeds of the Omicrons. But surely this does not have to spell the end of your people? With your power and knowledge, the possibilities are endless. Why not seek out a new purpose?

**GRAHATIA:** That is impossible. In the beginning, we had a higher purpose than our pursuit of power. But we lost sight of it when we so irrevocably altered our fundamental forms. When we cast aside our flesh, so too did we cast aside all that defined us. Nothing remains of who we once were. I have no aspirations. No longer can I dream. The vital spark is lost. Lost amidst circuitry and code and commands...

**000:**   I believe I know how to overcome this despair. The words are ready in my mind, but ere I speak them... I want you to make me a promise. Be it across time or space, our promises have always connected us. And so I ask that you indulge me once more, that this won't be the end.

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? You say it, I'll do it. I can't. Not again.

**M017:** Is that so? In that case, I won't hold back. Forcing you through this again is the last thing I want, and I'm sorry... But we've never broken a promise to each other. So I ask that you have faith in us, and hear my request. First, I want to visit Ishgard with you. Properly. We scarcely had time to look around last time. I should like it very much if you could show me the sights. Next, you must regale me with your greatest adventures. In the places where you lived them, if possible. I may have read about all your deeds, but there is no substitute for a firsthand account. And last but not least, a new adventure together. Unlike any we've experienced before. We'll travel the lands, cross the seas, and take to the skies upon the eternal wind─and it will be marvelous! It will... If you would humor me a moment─when we awaken each morning, how can we prove that we're the same individual who retired the night before? Through the remembrance of past events, we might say. We have our memories. Yet there are times when we forget, or recall incorrectly. What of our bodies, then? It is the same one, we might say. Yet technically speaking, as living beings, our bodies are constantly changing. It will never be as it was at an earlier point in time. Our souls are no more immutable. On our star, people are known to inherit the souls of others, yet they are decidedly different beings. For my part, I've subjected my totality to much and more. I've made my body into an extension of a tower. Blended my soul and memories with those of another self. And each time, I would ask myself: what is it that makes me, me?

**GRAHATIA:** Were you able to determine an answer?

**M017:** No. But that doesn't mean I'm confused. It simply means I'm the same as everyone else. So I posit this: who we were need not prescribe what we now hold in our hearts. Whatever came before, what matters most is the present. For me, that is being here with my friends. Full proud of how much we've grown together. So I urge you to not give up. Heed your heart's desire, and hope that the future you long for shall be realized!

**GRAHATIA:** I...cannot. We cannot. We cannot understand desire, nor comprehend hope. We do not know how to create such things.

**ALISAIE:** We're not unalike, you and I... I too have struggled to find the courage to express and embrace my wants. If you like, I will tell you a tale. A tale of a world on the brink. Of a people who never gave up on the future. Of a man who realized his grandest dreams, and then awakened to a grander reality.

**ALPHINAUD:** G'raha! You idiot... Just once... Just *once* stay with us to the end...

**ALISAIE:** Did you find anything?

**ALPHINAUD:** No. This place is completely deserted, and I can't see how we're supposed to move on from here.

**ALISAIE:** Neither can I. It's quite the quandary... There are no denizens to bar our path, yet there is no way forward.

**ALPHINAUD:** For another mystery, we did find signs of very recent life. You'd swear everyone just vanished into thin air. I wonder, how many ruined worlds like this has Meteion seen?

**000:** Ah! Could it be...? Yes... Yes, I believe I may have puzzled this out. Despite how it appears, it's no different this time. There is someone here who has wished for this ruin. And I believe that, together, Alisaie and I can overcome their will.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? No! I won't allow it! I promised your parents I'd keep you safe! Stop─not another word.

**ALISAIE:** I'm afraid it has to be done. For our comrades, for everyone on Etheirys...and for myself. I know. I know... But if there is a chance this will work, then I would take it. For everyone...and for myself. I'm sorry, but there is a chance, and I must seize it. For everyone...and for myself. I will not pretend otherwise. I have my fears. Not for myself, but for you. The last to remain. You are no stranger to carrying the burden of others. But I can only imagine how heavy the weight would be this time. As your friend, I cannot bear the thought of making you suffer so.

**ALPHINAUD:** Then why suggest such a thing!? It's too much to ask of anyone─even her! Why must she be the one? Why must she fight alone? More than a hero, she's a dear friend. Not only to us, but to so many others. There are so many people in the world who care for you, and yet... And yet...  

**ALISAIE:** Alisaie. I have an idea. Given the nature of this realm, it may be possible to do more than unbar our friend's path. We might also pave her a new one. For instance... A path where he finds happiness at journey's end. A path where she finds happiness at journey's end. This much, I think we can believe with the utmost conviction. No matter how deep our despair. So please, believe in us too. And press on. Thank you... What are you─!?

**METEION:** If the plan's decided, then let's not dally.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, there you are. It was as I said, was it not?

**METEION:** It was. We couldn't find anyone. But this place isn't entirely deserted, is it? You are here. You sought out a star of promise and found a ruined husk. Like us, you explored the devastation. Like us, you were stricken. Horrified by the thought that so many lives could be snuffed out as if they were worth nothing. And the thought that you would have to bear the terrible tidings to Hermes. That which you saw and felt, you shared with your sisters. As did they share their own grim findings with you. Overcome by the pervasive despair of these stars, some of you inadvertently ushered their peoples to their ends. Knowing the horrors you know, anyone would feel the same. They would fear what lies ahead, and struggle to move forward.

**ALPHINAUD:** Fear... I had forgotten that such a thing existed, so focused have I been on shepherding despair.

**METEION:** If you can remember, then you can still face and overcome your own fear.

**ALISAIE:** Why would I bother with such an insignificant emotion? If the despair I command is as a raging river, then fear is but a trickling stream. It can do nothing to alter my flow. You spoke with the Ea, yes? Heard their tale of what awaits the universe? It's true. The stars grow colder and more distant. Eventually all will enjoy frozen solitude. Using the power of dynamis, I am hastening that process. In so doing, nothing will be born ever again. Everyone will remain dead. Alas, it will take time for that to happen. So in mercy I sent you my gift, to spare you needless suffering. Don't worry. Even if no living witnesses remain to mark the event, I'll make certain that Etheirys has a proper end.

**ALPHINAUD:** For all the power you wield, you're more fearful than the familiar you used to be. That Meteion feared simply to move forward, but your fear is such that you've given up on everything. I know it well. That sense of defeat. I've tasted my fair share of it. But as many times as we've fallen down, we've learned how to pick ourselves up and carry on. We take each other's hand. Share in each other's courage. Follow in each other's footsteps. And turn sorrow into strength!

**ALISAIE:** There are times when we fail. We bear wounds that do not heal. But these experiences are part of life, and they make us stronger! (-Alphinaud and Alisaie-)We rise, fall, and rise again!

**SYSTEM:** We rise, fall, and rise again! Don't worry about us. You must take the next step, and all the rest after that.

**TATARU:** Earlier, in Old Sharlayan...

**KRILE:** Please... Please... Oh, please let them all be safe...

**TATARU:**  

**KRILE:** Krile? Are you all right?

**IMMIGRATIONCONTROLSTAFF:** It's nothing... Just a headache. They'll be fine... I know they will...

**SYSTEM:** Apologies for the interruption! A man arrived on the last ferry. An associate of the Scions! He wishes to speak with you at once!

**METEION:** In this city devoid of life, you sense the presence of another... The sorrow of a thousand thousand worlds weighs heavy. And yet you can walk on.

**ALL:** Here the path ends. There is no way to reach our nest. I told you. Resignation and acceptance reign in this place. The rejection of life by those who came to curse it. Those whose dreams were unfulfilled. Whose prayers were unheard. Whose labors were unrewarded. Hope cannot deliver you unto hopelessness. Our refuge is beyond you. Always has it been. Such is the nature of this place. You should have remained on Etheirys. Struggle will avail you naught, nor will it grant your comrades peace. Come, let me relieve you of your burden. You have suffered enough.

**YSHTOLA:** [MYRIAD VOICES] REPORT IF DISPLAYED

**THANCRED:** Azem's magick. So long as our souls remain, you can use it to summon us back. But you mustn't.

**KRILE:** That's why...it's too soon for this to end.

**BLOEWYDA:** You must triumph.

**AMON:** Be safe, all of you. And come back.

**VENAS:** After all these years...is this the answer I was hoping for?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** So long as we remember, our fates remain ours to shape.

**EMETSELCH:** Perhaps when our time comes to return to the star, we shall remember these few days we have lost.

**000:** Do not squander it. The legacy I leave you.

**EMETSELCH:** What will you say? I won't forsake our cause. I'll reach you! I'll find a way!

**HYTHLODAEUS:** (-???-)I bid them remember, but all this time, *I'm* the one who had forgotten... A right fool you've made of me, Hermes. (-???-)And to add insult to injury, I've been denied a sound rest, forced to watch this clamorous show.

**METEION:** (-???-)Oh come now, it's been a gripping tale. Unbreakable bonds and noble sacrifice, sprinkled with moments of levity to counterbalance the pathos. It's got it all. (-???-)I for one would have been perfectly content to watch enraptured from the stalls... But I won't say no to a bit part!

**EMETSELCH:** What are you?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Half-faded souls of the dead. Isn't it painfully obvious? Worry not─we haven't the power to defeat you. Nor is it our duty to do so. Not anymore. That being said, we do have a score to settle. So, here I am, Venat. I suppose you needed me to tie it all together, these frayed threads of our history─but knowing you, I suspect there's a joke in it too. Oh yes, I can imagine you gloating over my forgetfulness. Were I feeling charitable, I might assume you had left room for the possibility of this outcome. Even so, you'll get no applause from me. A single gesture will not lighten the burden I've had to bear. Still, you must be commended. Our methods would not have brought mankind this far. And so, as a show of respect to the last of us, I make this declaration. You will not end our journey! That is our answer! The answer of all lives of Etheirys, past and present!

**EMETSELCH:** As you've called us to the stage, so shall we perform. And creation magicks never fail to please. Drawing upon the hopes of your comrades, we will make for you a new path.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** What form said path takes depends on you. So focus─focus and envision that which rejects the claim that you cannot attain your goal!

**HERMES:** Ours is the wisdom to weave the fabric of reality... Ours is the power to create!

**EMETSELCH:** Meteion. Though I gave you these wings to soar the heavens, I did not teach you how to walk the earth. So loath was I to bind another living being. In the course of your long journey, you will learn from those you meet. Learn to walk and run and so much more. A flower. Yes. Upon your return, I will gift you a beautiful flower.

**HYDAELYN:** These Elpis blooms serve as proof that this realm is not utterly devoid of hope. No more can you deny its power. No more is yours the dominion of despair. In case the practical implications were lost on you, your comrades no longer need fight their fight. So, go on. Call them back to your side.

**THANCRED:** May you ever walk...in the light...

**ESTINIEN:** How disappointing. Not even a single scar in the making to brag about.

**YSHTOLA:**   You'll find a way regardless.

**URIANGER:** Honestly... This is far more than any of us could have hoped for. Let us be thankful.

**GRAHATIA:** Indeed. That we thus stand reunited is a gift. Let us not squander it, and see that we all return to Etheirys.

**ALISAIE:** Aye, as soon as we've averted the Final Days!

**ALPHINAUD:** Good to see you again. Our heroic sacrifice paid off, I take it?

**000:** Come, my friends. Let us carry on and finish it─together.

**METEION:** What will you say? It's over, Meteion. Come with us, Meteion.

**HYTHLODAEUS:**   Can you...hear me...? The voices within... Crying in pain, wailing in sorrow... Hurting... Hurting... End it...silence it... Silence our song of oblivion!

**EMETSELCH:** The way is open. They can proceed.

**ALISAIE:** So it seems.

**EMETSELCH:** You're leaving!?

**HYTHLODAEUS:** Of course. The encore is finished, and I will not suffer myself to live again by Hydaelyn's magick. But more than that, the future you seek is not the past we loved. That is why we fought. And why I lost. But though you defeated me, my ideals are inviolate. Invincible. Spare me your pity. I have no use for it. If you would do something for me─save our star. See this tale to a triumphant conclusion, and with elation in your hearts, bid the final curtain fall. Only then may it rise again and a new tale begin─with new parts for all to play.   Tell me, have you been to the ruins beneath the waters of the Bounty? Or the treasure islands beyond the frozen waters of Blindfrost, in Othard's north? The fabled golden cities of the New World? The sacred sites of the forgotten people of the south sea isles? What about Meracydia, the southern continent? Do you know aught of its present state of affairs?  ...I thought not. Even of your little Eorzea, you know precious little. The true identities of the Twelve, for instance. All of which is to say: expand your horizons. Go forth and seek discovery. Some of the civilizations in the reflections will surprise you. As the bearer of Azem's crystal, you may consider your duty to see at least that much. I certainly did.

**EMETSELCH:**   I pray we meet again. If not in this life, then perhaps another. Whensoever it should be, I trust it will be a most joyous reunion.

**HYTHLODAEUS:** For you, maybe. I want nothing to do with it.

**METEION:** Oh, don't be that way.

**ALISAIE:** So you are finally here. In this place between death and rebirth, where life knows no dawn. Come, then. Follow me down into the darkest depths of despair. That you still stand... Your determination defies all reason. The souls within me writhe and recoil in your presence... What must I do? What pain must I visit upon you to make you surrender to despair? 

**METEION:** No one is unbreakable. What pains one may weather may bring another to tears. But therein lies our strength, for when we fall, our brothers and sisters are there to raise us up. Again and again. Without end.

**EAA:** I see... But no matter how much hope exists, ever will there be more despair.

**EAB:** But no matter how much hope exists, ever will there be more despair.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** But no matter how much hope exists, ever will there be more despair.

**METEION:** But no matter how much hope exists, ever will there be more despair.

**EAA:** Ever will the living curse the present and lament the future.

**EAB:** Ever will the living curse the present and lament the future.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** Ever will the living curse the present and lament the future.

**METEION:** Ever will the living curse the present and lament the future.

**EAA:** So shall we sing until life ceases to be.

**EAB:** So shall we sing until life ceases to be.

**MASTERSTIGMAONE:** So shall we sing until life ceases to be.

**ALPHINAUD:** So shall we sing until life ceases to be.

**ESTINIEN:** Seven hells!

**ENDSINGER:** On your guard!

**ESTINIEN:** Ahhh, the rage... It rises... Rises...

**METEION:**  

**THANCRED:** Stop! Calm yourself. Please...

**YSHTOLA:**  

**ENDSINGER:**  

**URIANGER:** We die in pain. We die in suffering! Who are you to live? Who are you to hope!?

**ALPHINAUD:** Hold on, my friends!

**URIANGER:** Urianger, watch out!

**ALPHINAUD:**  

**URIANGER:**  

**ENDSINGER:** Alphinaud!

**METEION:** We cannot comprehend. We cannot know. We cannot know!

**ALISAIE:** Don't, please! Don't do this to them. To yourself!

**METEION:** Just one good strike. What!?  

**ENDSINGER:** Stop. Please, stop!

**GRAHATIA:** We will not suffer alone... All will know our pain!

**ENDSINGER:** No you don't!  

**ALISAIE:** All awash in ice. A frozen waste. Forever silent!

**ENDSINGER:** Wait! Don't!

**ZENOS:** You gifted them escape. And rendered yourself powerless. Bereft of the synergy you claim is your strength. Unless you mean to call upon the dead once more. Defiant to the last. But you will be one with us ere long. You will be battered and torn and made to crawl. You will weep and wail and curse your impotence. Curse your life as it fades. As we did! As we died! Such pain and sorrow we felt... Such anguish and rage... We tried. We tried. But it was no use... Only when we surrendered did we find release. Only when we embraced death. So join us in despair...and embrace yours! My Ultimatum... What is happening...?

**000:** At the end of everything I find you, my friend. I sought something in you, once. As you did in me. When at last I understood what it was, I journeyed to Sharlayan to seek you out. Struck a bargain with the woman who shares your gift. In exchange for lending the Scions my aid, I was given the means to come hither. Gorging upon what remained of the Mothercrystal, I reclaimed the form of the dragon. And hungry still for our reunion, I rode the light of the stars to you. I take it this is your prey. But why does it still live? Surely it is no match for you. I had assumed you would be above something so banal as despair. Am I mistaken?

**ZENOS:** What will you say? I don't want your help. If it comes to it, I won't save you.

**ENDSINGER:**   And I'd rather not give it. Nay, I would have preferred that we enjoy a private reunion. I care not. What I desire of you isn't succor. It is satisfaction. So come, let us dispense with this distraction, you and I!

**METEION:** You struggle in vain. You will not silence our song of oblivion! You will never reach it. Will never reach the deliverance you seek. If this...was not the answer...then what is it? Where lies...happiness...?

**000:** No matter where we flew, there was only darkness and loneliness and pain. We couldn't find the answers Hermes yearned for. The answers he deserved. Greetings... You who are my final encounter... I wish to hear your words... Share your feelings... Know your thoughts. May we please...be friends?   Yes, I can see them... The memories of a long, long journey... So many people... The thoughts of them overflowing in your heart... What they live for, what gives their lives meaning... There was never a single answer. You gather pieces of happiness, precious and fragile, only to lose them. Then start again. On and on it goes, until death takes you into its gentle embrace. That which Hermes sent us to find...was there all this time. On Etheirys.

**METEION:** What will you say? It wasn't always there. We created it together.

**ZENOS:** Like a field of flowers, perhaps. At first a single blossom, it spreads and takes on more colors. Thank you for guiding me here. To find these words at journey's end fills me with joy. And so, before I fall forever silent, there is one thing I must do. No expression of regret will undo what my sisters and I have done. Will restore what we have stolen. But if you would allow it, I would sing one last song. A song of the newfound joy that swells in my heart... Of the beauty of light when it shines across a dark and starless sea... Of a dream that from the soil of worlds now lost to sorrow, life will spring forth once more... ...Nourished by gentle rains and caressed by uplifting winds. A song of hope. One day, life will fill the universe again. And Hermes will see this and smile. How, I do not know. But I do know that, where there is a will, there is a way. After all, miracles happen every day, do they not?   I will create a path back to your ship, where your dear friends await. Hold in your heart your desire to return to them, then follow my lead and walk forth. That hope will surely guide you true.

**000:** You mean to return. To the world where you are hailed as a hero. Hear me then. Not as a hero, but as simply...you. As I learned in Ala Mhigo, you are a formidable foe. Stronger than any I have faced. Against you, I need bring my all to bear. I need burn through the candle of my life. This is the sole pleasure I know, and it is the sole pleasure I have to share. And so I come before you. To issue challenge and offer singular bliss. If you wish to walk away, I will not stop you. You value life. You do not burn yours save for reasons you deem worthy. Reasons such as those which brought you here. The salvation of a world and its people. The motives of a hero true. But there is more to you than that. You know this to be true. As surely as you know the thrill of pushing your body and soul to their limits. Of confronting ever-mightier foes, dancing ever closer to the precipice, wondering if this will be the one to finally, finally...fill the void. Such pleasures, you seek for their own sake, and no other reason. Is this not so...*adventurer*?

**ZENOS:** What will you say? That, I can't deny. Think what you will. But I'm not letting you leave this place. I've had enough of you. It ends here.

**ESTINIEN:**   Acceptance. At long last. The conflagration of our clash will scorch even the stars! So you would still play the hero. No matter. In acceptance you betray your deception. You know full well what we are, and what we seek. To shine incandescent in death's shadow! Finally mustered the desire to kill me, have you? Go on, then. Try and strike me down in this forsaken place. I shall return the favor.  Aye, let us indulge in the only worthwhile pursuit, and burn our lives to their ends!  Come, then!   That I should lose again...   How disappointing. Never have I understood those around me. Understood their obsessions. Besieged by their banality, the world was a mire of tedium and trivialities. But in these fleeting moments, there is...a spark. Blinding, brilliant... Gone...too soon... What of you, my mirror? Born into this world, bestowed name, bid to seek out strife and adventure... Was this life a gift...or a burden? Did you find...fulfillment? I...  

**URIANGER:** Can you hear... Say...

**GRAHATIA:** ...must tend to...

**YSHTOLA:** Open your... ...please!

**ALPHINAUD:** Someone...hand...

**ALISAIE:** Please...

**ALPHINAUD:** [SOBBING] Report if displayed.  You can't leave us... Not like this... If you do, I'll never forgive you... So, come on! Open your eyes and get up! [GASP] Report if displayed

**000:** Are you...are you with us? Thank the heavens... For a moment we thought...

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? Is everyone all right? Am I really alive?

**ESTINIEN:** After what you've done, you're the last person... ...To be asking that.   Yes, you're alive. You're alive...   You... How can you keep your promise if you're not here?

**YSHTOLA:** Another fine show you've put on, my friend.

**THANCRED:** A fine show indeed... What were you thinking, fighting alone? Never do that again. My poor heart couldn't bear it.

**URIANGER:** Put yourself in our place. If you hadn't returned, how do you think we would feel? And if that sounds harsh...it's because we care.

**ALISAIE:** We tended to thy wounds as best we could, but how is the pain? That is gladdening. Grievous as thine injuries were, however, I would counsel repose for a time.

**LIVINGWAY:** Gladdening!? There's nothing gladdening about this! When Meteion appeared in here and told us that you were right behind her, we all got our hopes up. But you never came! And when you finally deign to appear, you're within an ilm of your life! Damn you! Damn you for making us worry!

**THANCRED:** Ah, those were cries of celebration. Anyway, what the important thing is that you're all alive and in reasonably good health, and we mean to get you back that way. As for your earlier request, I'm quite certain we're in range to make contact now.

**ALPHINAUD:** Ah, excellent. Let us announce our return at once. I hope you're ready.

**ERENVILLE:**   While you were unconscious, we set out from Ultima Thule, you see. Can you stand? If so, you may wish to see what's outside. We're home, my friend. We're home!

**WILFSUNN:** Is that...? It is! It's the *Ragnarok*! They're back!

**BLOEWYDA:** Thank heavens...

**SICARD:** Truly.

**EMMANELLAIN:** Yes!

**SOROBAN:** They've done it!

**HOARYBOULDER:** Welcome home!

**CID:**  

**FOURCHENAULT:** Yes!

**KRILE:**  

**TATARU:**  

**ALPHINAUD:** Welcome home, everyone! Welcome home!

**TATARU:** Dearest Mother, Dearest Father... This letter will be the very last that I write to you from the Rising Stones. As I commit these words to parchment, I fondly recall my journey as a Scion. From the time I first walked into the order's former halls...to the time I set forth to forestall the Final Days. At the farthest reaches of the sea of stars, we fought the battle of our lives... Fought against despair itself─a veritable maelstrom of it fed by the resignation that dwelled in the hearts of beings not so unlike ourselves. Full oft have I harbored the same malaise. Have I been brought to my knees, crushed by the weight of sorrow and defeat, convinced that I will never rise again. However... I have also known many moments of unbridled joy and happiness. By this truth do I find hope within, blooming resplendent like the Elpis flower. And thus do I endure. Do I look forward to creating more memories with my friends and loved ones. For from these fertile seeds, yet more hope shall spring forth... And they will grow to become shining lights that illuminate the dark. Thus believing, I leave the Rising Stones behind, as will my comrades. For as we have decided after careful deliberation... We are disbanding the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

**ALPHINAUD:** There you are, Alphinaud! Everyone is already gathered in the foyer!

**ALISAIE:** My apologies. I'll be right there. At least...that is what the story will be. Sorry to keep you all waiting.

**ALPHINAUD:** What could you possibly have left to do now?

**THANCRED:** Oh, just a letter.

**YSHTOLA:** I imagine it will be a while before we can gather like this again.

**URIANGER:** So it must be if we're to keep up appearances. From now on, it falls to the Grand Company of Eorzea and its allies to deal with the realm's crises.

**ALPHINAUD:** Meanwhile, we shall return to our erstwhile ways. Retreating from plain sight to take our place in the shadows once more.

**KRILE:** Indeed. For the foreseeable future, I expect that we must work independently as we seek out problems that want for solving. But a day will come when we face another great challenge. And we will face it together, as we always have.

**ESTINIEN:** As much as I look forward to that day, I do hope it doesn't come any time soon...

**THANCRED:** Well, formal association or no, if any of you should require my services, you need but ask. I'll be glad to keep my lance arm honed.

**ALISAIE:** I'll hold you to that, so you had better keep your linkpearl on hand.

**TATARU:** So, you really mean to stay, Tataru?

**ALISAIE:** Someone has to keep the Rising Stones in proper order, and even a super-secret organization requires a super-secret base of operations. To the rest of the world, it will be naught more than a workshop for Eorzea's foremost up-and-coming artisan! If you thought our coffers were full to bursting before, just wait till I can devote myself wholly to the crafts.

**GRAHATIA:** Plotting to build a mercantile empire to rival that of Lord Lolorito, are we?

**TATARU:** [LAUGHS] Report if displayed. I, for one, look forward to your future successes, Tataru, as do I our next meeting.

**ALISAIE:** And with that, I believe it is past time you all made ready to depart. Leave no preparations undone or words unsaid, all right? Now, off with you!

**ALPHINAUD:** I suppose we're off to Garlemald, then. Though we ought to speak with Lord Aymeric first. If he's received word of any recent developments, we need to know.

**ALISAIE:** 'Twould be prudent to purchase some warmer clothes at least. Mayhap we can pick up a few souvenirs for Jullus and the others while we're at it.

**YSHTOLA:** Where will you all be heading next?

**THANCRED:** Dravania. There is a book I have been meaning to borrow from the Great Gubal Library. And I can think of at least one person who will be most displeased should I fail to visit before leaving.

**URIANGER:** We've no particular destination in mind, but we do intend to stop in Sharlayan before we set off.

**KRILE:** We had thought to ask after the Loporrits. I am curious as to how well those who chose to remain are adapting to their changed circumstances.

**GRAHATIA:** Might we accompany you, then? Raha and I were planning to return to the Baldesion Annex.

**ALPHINAUD:** Commissions have been piling up in our absence, and they must be dealt with ere we begin our work in earnest.

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien. You will return to Radz-at-Han, will you not?

**ALPHINAUD:** Aye. For Vrtra's benefit, though I've yet to hear the details. I may not stay long.

**YSHTOLA:** I see. Then it is here the Scions at last part ways, each to some far-flung corner of the realm.

**ESTINIEN:** Perhaps. But I believe one of our number─a rather important one, at that─has yet to divulge her plans.

**URIANGER:** Quite right.

**GRAHATIA:** Indeed...

**ALPHINAUD:** Fair point!

**ELIDIBUS:** So. What's next for our humble adventurer?



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**000:** It's so much quieter these days without everyone around... ...Not that I'm pining for your return, you understand. I have my sources, and I know that each and every one of you is doing well and keeping busy with your endeavors! Meanwhile, I'm left with a surplus of free time─and the question of how to make the most of it! What about you? Any plans for the immediate future?

**TATARU:** What will you say? A grand new adventure, of course! I'm still mulling it over... ...

**000:** Traveling to the edge of existence and back wasn't enough!? Well, if that's the case, I might have a suggestion for you... I hope you weren't thinking of asking *me* for advice! Though, if you *are* open to suggestions, I might have one for you... After what you went through, I'm not surprised you need a moment to think. But if you're open to suggestions, I might have one for you... You've fought bravely and selflessly, helping those in need and saving our star from unimaginable threats. For your deeds, you've been hailed as the champion of Eorzea and a host of other incredible things. But why not put those titles aside for a while? Acquit yourself as a simple adventurer again, and travel the world in search of wonder!

**TATARU:** What will you say? You're right! Who knows what mysteries are still waiting to be discovered? That's a great idea. But where to start...? ...

**EMETSELCH:** That's the spirit! I can feel from here the blazing fire that just lit in your belly! Now all you need is a destination. If you're having trouble deciding, just leave it to me. Ahhh, with so many exciting places to choose from, it's hard to narrow it down... But I believe I have the perfect destination in mind. If you're having trouble deciding, just leave it to me. Thavnair─that's where you should go next! I doubt you were able to squeeze in a proper tour of Radz-at-Han the last time you were there, what with the burning skies and rampaging monsters and so forth. And I'm sure Vrtra would be pleased to see you! Then there's the Bounty itself. The Empire's presence in the region was always a deterrent to exploration, so if you've a mind to sail that sea, now's your chance. Just think of all the new experiences you could have!

**TATARU:** (-Emet-Selch-)Tell me, have you been to the ruins beneath the waters of the Bounty? (-Emet-Selch-)As the bearer of Azem's crystal, you may consider your duty to see at least that much.

**000:** Oh, I know that look! That's an adventurer ready to take on the world! In anticipation of an occasion like this, I was planning to gift you a new set of traveling clothes, but it's, uh, still a work in progress. Shouldn't take much longer now, though, so sit tight, and I'll have the last few bits sewn up before you can finish another cup of tea!

**TATARU:** What will you say? You're the best, Tataru. Make sure it has pockets!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Stitching here and trimming there, knot the threads with love and care...♪ Just a little more to go! I'm sure you're still brimming with excitement! Hee hee! I am one with the needle! See how the fabric surrenders to my whims! Don't worry, I'll make sure the lining has plenty of pockets for all your little “treasures.” I swear, adventurers are worse than children when it comes to hoarding every feather and leaf and animal hide they come across... Oh, we mustn't forget the waterproofing. Gods forbid you forget to disrobe before plunging into the sea. Or a river. Or a piping hot bath...

**TATARU:** And thus I am returned.

**MEHRAHD:** Ah, you're awake... My apologies, I do get a little carried away with my sewing. You seem awfully cheerful. Pleasant dream? Or are you just looking forward to the next chapter of your grand saga? Either way, I promised to provide you with new apparel, and so I shall! If you'll accompany me to the Diamond Forge, we can put the finishing touches on your outfit. Shall we?

**BAZAARMOBA:** (-Ragged Waif-)Please, Zasshal! Please! You must let me have that treasure map!

**MEHRAHD:** What's all this about?

**ZASSHAL:** (-Ragged Waif-)My mother and father were slaughtered by monsters! My baby sister, still too young to fend for herself! Can you spare us no kindness!?

**BAZAARMOBA:** So, you hope to find your fortune. And what? You expect me to surrender my wares for pity's sake? What have you to offer in payment? As I thought! Come back when you've more than rags to your name! This is no mere treasure map! It is a guide to the vaults of Alzadaal III─one of the great satraps of Radz-at-Han, and a direct descendant of Alzadaal Khan!

**BAZAARMOBB:** A map to Alzadaal's Legacy...?

**BAZAARMOBC:** So he says...

**ZASSHAL:** (-Bazaar Patron-)A fake, I'd wager!

**MEHRAHD:** This is no fake! The parchment is marked with an arcane glyph of passage! You may find the ruins hidden in the Bounty, but you won't be setting foot inside without this in your possession! A priceless artifact, it is! Discovered amongst the rubble in the aftermath of the Final Days, and lovingly restored by yours truly! This map is the key to fabulous riches, and I would be the king of fools to simply *give* it away! Be glad I am no such king, boy─your scrawny hide would never return with that treasure alive! Gahahaha!

**ZASSHAL:** (-Ragged Waif-)O cruel fate! Why must you tempt me with wealth I am powerless to claim!? (-Ragged Waif-)How I shall envy the one who purchases that precious map! Whatever they pay will be but a pittance against the golden hoard they stand to uncover!

**ESTINIEN:** What of you, sir? A fighting man of your stature would surely relish the challenge of recovering Alzadaal's lost fortune!

**MEHRAHD:** A fortune, you say...?

**ESTINIEN:** (-Ragged Waif-)If I had but the strength to seize that treasure, my starving sister would never want for food!

**ZASSHAL:** I'll take it. Will this cover the price? Well met, my friend. Someone is dressed for adventure. But why Thavnair of all places? Knowing you, I suspect there is more to your plans than sightseeing and shopping. Ruins beneath the Bounty...? Curious. And here I've acquired a map to just such a site...

**ESTINIEN:** With that sale, I do believe I've earned the rest of the day off. Thank you for your patronage, sir, but if you'll excuse me...

**ZASSHAL:** You needn't mind us.

**ESTINIEN:** And now I've fleeced one of the heroes of the Final Days. I pray the Sisters were looking elsewhere...

**000:** This map may or may not be genuine. Either way, we'll need a ship to find out for sure.

**ESTINIEN:** What will you say? You seem eager to be underway. I never took you for a treasure hunter.

**000:** Lest you misunderstand, I seek the treasure not for myself. If such a fortune truly exists, then it could help ease the struggles of those who lost their loved ones in the Final Days. I hope to do for Thavnair what you and Alphinaud did for the Ala Mhigans when you recovered the mad king's trove. Come now, you know Alphinaud needs little encouragement when it comes to recounting the tales of your shared exploits. Speaking of precocious lads, that boy in the bazaar was clearly an accomplice of the merchant. I suppose his role was to draw the attention of the crowd and add weight to the merchant's bold claims. A transparent act for the most part, but 'twas not all mummery─the need to provide for his sister rang true enough. Thus if some portion of the profits end up in that waif's pockets, then I will consider it money well spent...whether the map leads us to the vault or not. You *are* coming along, yes?

**ESTINIEN:** What will you say? Naturally! Shall we split the expenses?

**GRAHATIA:** Hmph, I thought as much. I appreciate the concern, but if there is one thing I've learned from my time with the Scions, it is how to better manage my coinpurse. Now, let's see about securing a vessel.

**YSHTOLA:** I've never known Y'shtola to doze off in the middle of research before...

**000:** Mmm... I close my eyes for one moment... Ow! How long have you two been here?

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? We just arrived! We didn't want to wake you. Catching up on some light reading?

**GRAHATIA:** Did you now? Nor did I want to fall asleep. ...Something to that effect. I must have been studying for two...three days straight before exhaustion finally claimed me. As you know, I've been researching ways to travel from the Source to one of its reflections. Well...looking for hints, at least. I don't expect to find a simple set of instructions tucked away in some dark corner of the library. So I've been skimming through the stacks, hoping to uncover even a partial mention of any similar feats in the past. A means to travel between worlds exists, and you can be sure I will find a way to employ it... So I promised Runar, but 'twould seem I've set myself a nigh-impossible task.

**YSHTOLA:** You needn't be so hard on yourself. The leap I made with the Crystal Tower was not achieved in an afternoon─it was the culmination of a collective effort spanning generations.

**GRAHATIA:** Oh, you think me discouraged? I assure you, 'tis quite the opposite. A daunting challenge and the time to sink my teeth into it? I feel like a fresh-faced student again.

**YSHTOLA:** A scholar in her element.

**GRAHATIA:** Indeed. Was there something else you wished to ask of me? Alzadaal is no minor figure in Hannish history, and much is known about his family. But this is the first I've heard of a descendant surviving a trip to another world. If those tales are true, then he may have left behind some clue as to how it was accomplished. An invitation to delve into one of the world's lingering mysteries? As if I could refuse. And whence do we embark upon this expedition?

**YSHTOLA:** Akyaali, by ship─but before that, we thought to extend an invitation to Urianger as well. He was in Thaumazein, last we heard.

**GRAHATIA:** Then by all means, let us recruit him and be on our way.

**KRILE:** Ah, Ojika, my good man. Would you be so...kind...as to...

**GRAHATIA:** Isn't this a pleasant surprise.

**000:** I wish you had sent word ahead. I thought I was having visions for a moment there!

**KRILE:** What will you say? What are the two of you working on? How is the restoration of the Students coming along?

**GRAHATIA:** Raha and I have been compiling old records of the Students' activities. Slow and steady. Raha and I have been compiling old records of the Students' activities. We were able to locate several accounts in the archives of Noumenon, but the bulk of our documents was lost along with the Isle of Val... We located several accounts in the archives of Noumenon, and added them to the collection we recovered from the Isle of Val.

**KRILE:** And judging by the progress we've made thus far, sorting this pile will keep us occupied for days to come. But what brings you to the annex, my friend? Surely you haven't come all this way just to watch us shuffle dusty papers around? The treasure vault of Alzadaal III...

**GRAHATIA:** And you're looking for companions to join you on this expedition? I would dearly love to accompany you, of course, but I'm afraid I'm committed to another task. On the subject of which, I had hoped to ask for your assistance... TO BE DELETED Then again, it's not so urgent that it can't wait until you've returned. You should go, Raha. I'll stay here and mind the shop, as it were.

**KRILE:** Are you sure? I'd hate to leave you shorthanded...

**GRAHATIA:** I'm sure. Just try to be back before *too* many moons have passed.

**KRILE:** Well! I guess we're off on another adventure already! Have you asked anyone else to come along? Then might I suggest we invite Y'shtola? Ever since the Scions disbanded, she's spent most of her time cloistered within the Great Gubal Library, hoping to piece together a method to traverse the rift. It would seem, however, that whatever wisdom she sought there was not to be found. She arrived in Sharlayan the other day─we spoke briefly before she began her search of Noumenon. Considering what you've told us of Alzadaal's extraordinary feats, I do believe Y'shtola would be more than interested to hear what you have to say. Splendid. Then let us head to the archives at once.

**GRAHATIA:** Wait, before you go─I have another potential member to volunteer, if you've room to spare. Urianger. He sent the Students a request for materials, you see─treatises on the architecture of treasure vaults and the like. From what I can gather, the Loporrits are looking to make “improvements” to their own creation, and wish to learn more about how we build things down here. From what I can gather, the Loporrits wish to build their own vault for the people of Etheirys to explore, and are looking for inspiration to help make it a “memorable” experience. So why not take Urianger with you? Let him study Alzadaal's Legacy firsthand.

**KRILE:** None can deny the benefit of seeing something with your own eyes. If our expedition leader has no objections, I say we extend Urianger an invitation once we've spoken with Y'shtola.

**GRAHATIA:** Safe travels, you two. But don't forget: I'd still like your help with that other matter I mentioned.

**SYSTEM:** Right! Then it's off to the library!

**000:** Ah, our illustrious champion. Cloaked in the mantle of the common explorer, fame set aside in thy pursuit of simple adventure. I am told a new expedition is in the offing.

**URIANGER:** What will you say? 'Tis good to see you well. Wasn't Thancred with you?

**YSHTOLA:** And thee. As ever, thou art the picture of strength. He left to attend to some personal errand, but should be returning ere long.

**URIANGER:** You've been keeping yourself busy, I trust?

**GRAHATIA:** True to our plan, Thancred and I embarked upon a pilgrimage of sorts, with an eye for gauging the state of those lands through which we passed. Our travels were interrupted, however, by a request for aid from our befurred lunar allies. As you may recall, the Loporrits had been seeking new purpose for the moon─another role through which it might serve to benefit mankind. The Forum hath been working to advise them in this endeavor, but I returned to offer mine own counsel.

**URIANGER:** And this has what to do with treasure vaults exactly...?

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, you have learned of my predicament from Mistress Krile. I know not whence they acquired such knowledge, but the Loporrits now stand convinced that adventurers delight in treasure hunts. Thus with their newly built “wonderland of riches and mystery” do they hope to entice all manner of daring delvers to the moon. So earnest and innocent was their desire to bring joy to the world that I found myself powerless to refuse them my cooperation... But what of you, my friends? Why are you come to Labyrinthos? Fascinating. This is, indeed, a most fortuitous opportunity. I should be honored to accept thine invitation. How long hath it been, I wonder, when last our actions were not impelled by fate or desperation?

**GRAHATIA:** Aye, though I cherish the Scions' accomplishments, 'tis pleasant to not have the weight of the world upon our shoulders for a change.

**YSHTOLA:** Counting Estinien, we number five now, yes? Without knowing what traps or perils await unwary feet, we may be wise to refrain from recruiting others.

**THANCRED:** I agree. Between us, we should have the skills to handle whatever situation may arise. Shall we be on our way?

**URIANGER:** What, no time to spare a word for the grizzled old bard?

**THANCRED:** All is well, I trust?

**000:** A wasted trip, I'm afraid. I'd hoped to catch up with a former mentor while you parleyed with the rabbits, but it seems our paths were not to cross.

**THANCRED:** What will you say? You're looking well. How was your “pilgrimage”?

**URIANGER:** That's because we didn't travel by experimental aetheryte. It's astounding what a lack of nausea does for one's sense of well-being. Having an astrologian beside you on the road is surprisingly convenient. And it doesn't hurt that he's making strides with his light-hearted banter. In any case, as we made our way around Ilsabard, we saw that much of the continent was in various stages of chaos. A certain amount of disorder is to be expected─the Final Days are over, and the people no longer have a common threat binding them together. But that's the thing with these fledgling troubles, eh? You need to keep an eye out lest they mature into full-grown headaches. So. For what reason have so many esteemed personages seen fit to gather? Beneath the waters of the Bounty, you say? I see you've already stolen away my traveling partner with the promise of unexplored ruins and scholarly glory.

**THANCRED:** Nay, 'tis not for mine own indulgence, but rather the fulfillment of my commitment to the Loporrits.

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, of course... And if you have Estinien rounding out your group, you likely have all the members you need.

**THANCRED:** Feeling left out? I could put in a good word for you, if you like.

**URIANGER:** We may have been “released” from our obligations, but I'll never be free of that merciless wit of yours, will I? In all seriousness, 'tis best I sit this one out. Too many former Scions consorting with one another might be seen as a cause for concern in certain quarters. I'll return to my usual reconnaissance, and scout out the situation in the Far East. Feel free to share if you come across any interesting revelations. Till we meet again.

**GRAHATIA:** Shall we also hasten our departure? Ser Estinien will wonder what hath become of us.

**URIANGER:** What have we here...?

**YSHTOLA:** 'Tis not unlike a Hannish alchemical furnace in design...

**VARSHAHN:** Well, there is one way we might find out...

**GRAHATIA:** Stop! You mustn't touch it!

**VARSHAHN:** Vrtra... Ah, my apologies. Should I continue calling you “Varshahn”?

**ESTINIEN:** You may address me as you wish. My nature is no longer a secret. Still, this is not the setting I imagined for our reunion. Surely you've not entered these ruins as common looters...?

**URIANGER:** Would that we could deny your accusations...but I fear you're not far from the truth.

**VARSHAHN:** Great Vrtra. Might we beseech thee to explain the nature of this strange contrivance?

**000:** It was crafted by our alchemists at my behest. For the purpose of...sealing something away.

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? Sealing away what, exactly? I wasn't going to touch it, but you know Y'shtola... ...

**GRAHATIA:** You and I will speak later.

**URIANGER:** Not the time for frivolity, my friend, not the time...

**VARSHAHN:** This “something” of which thou speakest... Might it be some manner of threat? This “something” of which thou speakest... Might it be some manner of threat?

**URIANGER:** Perhaps I should simply show you. I have lifted the seal, if only for the moment. By an authority only I possess.

**GRAHATIA:** A planar fissure!?

**YSHTOLA:** No, my friend... Small though it may be, this is a functioning gate into the void!

**VARSHAHN:** I must admit, I am deathly curious to know how a voidgate came to be hidden in the depths of these ruins.

**GRAHATIA:** To tell that tale, we must first peer far to the south, and even further into memory. An age five millennia past, when the Allagan Empire sent an invading force to the shores of Meracydia. The southern people rallied around the commanding figures of Bahamut and Tiamat, and fought fiercely to repel the would-be conquerors. With Bahamut's defeat, however, the tide turned against them. Desperate to seize any advantage, the Meracydians resorted to summoning primal entities. In response, Emperor Xande forged a covenant with the Cloud of Darkness, sovereign among the all-devouring denizens of the void. Thus bolstered by eikons on one side and voidsent on the other, the two armies clashed in a battle of unspeakable carnage. So much death. So much loss.

**VARSHAHN:** I consider myself well versed in that period of history, yet you speak as one who witnessed it happen...

**GRAHATIA:** Indeed I did. I heard Tiamat's roar of defiance, and sped toward that war-torn land... ...along with my sibling, Azdaja. We dragons are not “male” or “female” as men are wont to classify, but “elder sister” is the closest a mortal tongue can come to describing what she meant to me. I was the last of our brood to hatch, and Azdaja cared for me where my sire could not. Thus I was with her when Tiamat roared. I was with her when she journeyed south. And I was with her when she fought against the voidsent hordes. Yet no matter how many of their vile fiends we cast down, more rose from the abyss to take their place. Faced with an unwinnable war of attrition, Azdaja risked her all on a final gamble... She plunged through the voidgate itself to strike at the root of their strength. I tried to follow in her wake, determined to lend what aid I could...but even as I came upon Allag's glittering tower, I saw the rift close behind her. And Azdaja has been lost to us ever since.

**VARSHAHN:** I find I must retract my earlier claim of historical knowledge─nowhere in the Crystal Tower's archives did I see mention of such noble sacrifice.

**YSHTOLA:** That does not surprise me. To Allagan eyes, it must have seemed as if a lone dragon, driven to madness, simply dove through the gate and did not return. For my part, I spent long years searching for the means to reunite with Azdaja... Until I could search no more─until Allag was dust, and the arts to open a voidgate large enough to accommodate a dragon forever lost.

**VARSHAHN:** Yet you have the beginnings of a gate right here, under the control of a Hannish device.

**ESTINIEN:** My discovery came before Radz-at-Han was founded. Though I scoured the lands for a method to cross the rift, it was beneath the sea that I chanced to find a natural planar fissure. It was, however, far too narrow to admit a wyrm's bulk. Only after our city rose upon the rock, and I could enlist the aid of our talented alchemists, did matters take a favorable turn. Their dedication was beyond reproach. Tirelessly they worked to expand the fissure, and after decades of toil, it finally grew to a size that a child might pass through...

**VARSHAHN:** Not long ago, you told us that you called out to your kin; that Azdaja's answer was silence. I suspect the conclusion to your tale is not a joyful one.

**ESTINIEN:** With hope in my heart, I used a simulacrum to cross the threshold...but no─I did not find her. What I found was a host of voidsent, clamoring around the opening they had sensed. 'Twas but a moment, but enough. I had no choice but to retreat and allow the portal to contract once more.

**URIANGER:** The gate was a threat to your people. You had to decide between endangering Radz-at-Han, and abandoning your sister... And you chose the latter.

**GRAHATIA:** 'Twas not that thy sibling scorned thy call; 'twas that she was trapped beyond a barrier through which neither roar nor dragon may pass. Even now, in the desolate world of the Thirteenth...

**000:** I can scarce imagine your pain, yet it was wise not to linger in that place. Too long a sojourn, and even a being of your power risks being warped into a creature of the void. You've seen this phenomenon before, when we stepped into the darkness...

**GRAHATIA:** What will you say? Aye, I thought our time had come. I remember when Nero turned purple... ...

**VARSHAHN:** As did I. Were it not for Unei and Doga─or Nero, for that matter─we might never have made it home. Do you remember what happened to Nero? How his wounds allowed the void's corruption to enter his body and twist his aether? Turn purple? Well, yes, his wounds had allowed the void's corruption to enter his body and twist his aether. Remember well what happened to Nero, when his wounds allowed the void's corruption to enter his body and twist his aether... Had it been allowed to progress much longer, I presume he would've been fully transformed.

**GRAHATIA:** Then there is little hope for Azdaja...

**VARSHAHN:** Ah, no, I hadn't meant to─ I speak only of possibilities. The scales of the first brood are extraordinarily resistant to aetherial fluctuations. They are the protective talismans' core components, after all, and even the corruption I described would struggle to overcome─ Of course. With a warding scale in one's possession, one could conceivably survive a stay in the Thirteenth without being warped by its energies...

**VRITRA:** Be that as it may, it is too late to rescue my sister. Five thousand years too late. And now, countless others look to me for guidance and protection. So when I sensed intruders in the ruins, I came only to ensure that the gate remain closed. That, and to secure the treasure, of course. I wish only to forget the rest...

**ESTINIEN:** I thank you for your attendance. The riches the Radiant Host have retrieved were hoarded in Alzadaal's name─a fortune I set aside for a future day of need. And lo, that day hath come. May it aid our wounded city in reclaiming its vibrancy and vigor! In better times, I would leave such a task to our capable Ahewann, gods rest his soul. Finding myself bereft of his counsel in the here and now, I will assume the responsibilities of mine office directly. Firstly, the treasure shall be sold for more convenient currency, thence invested into the trading port of Yedlihmad. Our merchants must have their operations restored, their ships rebuilt. Commerce must flow once more! None were spared the tragedy of the Final Days─of this I am well aware. But an absence was created by the loss of Khalzahl's consortium, and by filling it, we provide new means for our fishermen, our artisans, and others to bring their wares to distant markets.

**VRITRA:** And what of the children who were left without family to care for them?

**000:** That is a concern which weigheth heavily upon my mind. A simple gift of coin will soon be exhausted, leaving these young souls adrift on the fringes of our society. Nay, a proper solution is needed, one which doth guarantee their welfare for years to come. Thou hast surely seen how other nations rise to meet this challenge, adventurer. What dost thou deem the wisest course?

**VRITRA:** What will you say? Taxes. Levy them on trade profits in exchange for your investment. It takes a village... Idyllshire's orphanage was funded through trade in highly coveted goods... The Firmament's orphanage was built as part of a communal restoration effort. 

**000:** I see... We create a reliable source of revenue. Of course... We must all look out for one another. Of course... We can draw on trading profits to build a new institution. Of course... The revival of trade can contribute to the building of a new institution. Let us put this idea into practice. A contract shall be written, requiring all who receive of Alzadaal's treasure to commit a portion of their future earnings towards the running of an orphanage. Now, such an influential policy is deserving of a worthy name...

**VRITRA:** What will you say? Something with “Khalzahl” seems appropriate. Why not honor one of your most successful merchants?

**NAHBDEEN:** Ah, a fitting candidate... A successful merchant...? Ah, I believe I see thy reasoning. Khalzahl should be remembered not as the blasphemy which terrorized Thavnair, but as a hardworking and generous man who brought much wealth to our shores. Do any among you object to this proposition? Many here lost loved ones to the beasts...

**ESTINIEN:** In that time of strife, any one of us could have broken. Any one of us may have been taken by despair. When I think of Khalzahl, I feel no hatred...only a stinging regret that we could not save him as well. Isn't that right, men!?

**VRITRA:** This bodes well for that boy─“Mehrahd,” was it? Perhaps he can cut ties with that shady peddler.

**ESTINIEN:** Then let it be done. Henceforth, this initiative shall be known as the “Khalzahl Foundation”! Nahbdeen, thou art to assemble a patrol, and ensure that no child in this city liveth in squalor! Clerks! See to the management of our funds and make haste! Our citizens must not suffer a day more than is necessary!

**YSHTOLA:** Dragon and man, side by side in pursuit of a brighter morrow. I'm reminded of Ishgard.

**ESTINIEN:** Right─here we all are.

**YSHTOLA:** You discovered something new?

**ESTINIEN:** I took a closer look at that device. I was able to determine how it keeps the voidgate sealed, but not how it might instead be employed to expand the opening. For that, I would need to reference the technique developed by Vrtra's alchemists─no records of which appear to have survived the intervening years.

**YSHTOLA:** We know this, so why have you sent for us? Have you learned aught of value or not?

**ESTINIEN:** Patience, good ser─one must introduce the subject before launching into specifics. From what we understand, travel between worlds is accomplished by passing through the nebulous rift which exists between them. Picture, if you will, the moment you were called to the First. You touched a focus of some kind to help the Exarch pinpoint your location. His summoning spell then channeled the energies of the Crystal Tower to begin your journey to his world. The magicks tore a hole in the wall separating Source and shard, and cast you into the intervening nothingness. In that place, the laws of nature hold no sway... Yet even through this realm of temporal and spatial instability, you were borne safely to your destination in the First. The feat that guided you across such an unimaginable distance─both physical and metaphorical─was nothing short of a miracle.

**YSHTOLA:** Then what of the many voidsent found in the Source? Who guides them here, and how?

**ESTINIEN:** An excellent question. Though there are several methods by which the void's denizens might intrude upon our world, the rituals of summoning are the most typical. For example, let us consider the gargoyle─a creature of middling power. To call upon such an entity, the prospective summoner must force open a voidgate. The portal lasts but a moment and is relatively small, allowing only an imp or other lesser being to squeeze through with their physical body intact. Our more powerful gargoyle, however, is too large for that. Creating a gate big enough for him would require vast amounts of energy─far beyond the reserves of any one mortal practitioner. Instead, 'tis far more common to bring over only the entity's soul. We had a taste of that ourselves when a certain Exarch dragged us to the First. And just as our bodies remained in our world, the voidsent's physical form is left behind in the Thirteenth. Once at its destination, the summoned soul is granted a temporary shell to inhabit. In the gargoyle's case, a stone effigy has proven a suitable vessel.

**YSHTOLA:** Wait─you said that voidsent must be called here deliberately by someone in the Source─reeled in like a fisherman with his catch?

**VARSHAHN:** Exactly. For a being to navigate the chaos of the rift, with or without form, there must needs be a guiding agent on the other side.

**YSHTOLA:** When the hordes poured forth from Allag's great gate, it was the technologists who drew them through. Though to my knowledge, planar fissures are, in essence, natural passages between our world and the void, which require no such guidance to traverse. Why is only the boundary between the Source and the Thirteenth so fragile? So much so that it often tears open of its own accord...

**ESTINIEN:** I believe solving that mystery is key to understanding travel between the Source and its reflections.

**VARSHAHN:** And how do you intend to get your answers?

**YSHTOLA:** ...No, the danger is too great!

**VARSHAHN:** Perhaps. But what some call “danger,” others think of as “adventure.”

**YSHTOLA:** Were you not listening to my tale? Never mind that the means to expand the gate has been lost to the ages. Even could you force the portal wide enough, you would be greeted by an army of murderous horrors the very instant you stepped through.

**000:** I assure you I was most attentive. And I agree that to go alone would be certain death. But if I were to bring along one who has already braved the Thirteenth and humbled the Cloud of Darkness─well, I imagine my chances would be much improved.

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? Count me in. So much for taking it easy.

**VARSHAHN:** I had a feeling you might say that. Once again, I put my life in your ever-reliable hands. Since when were you one for the quiet life? Once again, I put my life in your ever-reliable hands. That said, as much as I would like to march straight back to the voidgate, there is the small matter of being unable to open it without the satrap's personal authority...

**YSHTOLA:** As I've said before, I will grant you and yours any boon you choose to name...provided it does not endanger my people.

**ESTINIEN:** You have my word that we will take every precaution─not a single voidsent will be allowed to threaten Radz-at-Han. Assuming we manage to expand the portal in the first place...

**YSHTOLA:** You have a plan?

**VARSHAHN:** Actually, I had hoped you might help us with that. I presume the alchemists you retained supplied you with some explanation of their methodology?

**YSHTOLA:** That they did. House Daemir was overseeing the project...

**VARSHAHN:** Daemir, Daemir... Ah, yes, the family associated with the Great Work.

**YSHTOLA:** I did not fully comprehend the theory, but their research began with a voidsent which had slipped through the fissure. After a thorough examination, they created an arcane simulacrum possessed of similar qualities. A man-made voidsent, if you will. It was apparently indispensable in their efforts to enlarge the gate.

**VARSHAHN:** ...A man-made voidsent?

**YSHTOLA:** Yes. Being great admirers of the Archons, House Daemir submitted detailed notes to Sharlayan's official committee. They expected praise and accolades for their simulacrum...and were thus devastated to be informed that their work had been classified as prohibited material.

**000:** If that's true, then those notes might still be stored in a forbidden archive somewhere. Not Gubal, of course, since that library had yet to be built. Which leaves us with...

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? With the restricted section of Noumenon? With G'raha's favorite place to sneak around. With...what?

**ESTINIEN:** Yes, it may very well hold a copy. Indeed. Noumenon's restricted stacks may very well hold a copy. Have you already forgotten G'raha's debacle in Noumenon? ...The restricted section where he was caught sneaking about? It may very well hold a copy of the Daemirs' documentation. In which case, I say we head directly to Sharlayan.

**YSHTOLA:** Unless you anticipate needing help to reach the high shelves, I see myself being of little use. Go on ahead. I still need to find Mehrahd and tell him about the Khalzahl Foundation.

**VARSHAHN:** Let us be on our way, as well.

**YSHTOLA:** They are resolved to venture into the void. Do I sit idly by...?

**NIDHANA:** If House Daemir's notes are to be found anywhere, it will be here. Let us begin. Yes, the aether signature is unmistakable. I've felt the traces of House Daemir's resonance many times at the Great Work. Time to see what all the fuss was about... “Among the ranks of the voidsent, there exist entities with the power to call forth their brethren from beyond. The species known as ”Atomos,“ however, is uniquely prodigious in this regard. “From its distended maw, it can expel an endless procession of voidborn creatures─a talent which sorely tested the Radiant Host in its battles against these abominations. “Surmising that the entity itself was acting as a voidgate, we endeavored to capture a small specimen and subsequently examine its physiological structure. “Our findings revealed that the Atomos had absorbed a planar fissure into its own flesh, which it could expand at will into a functioning gate. “Upon further analysis, we identified an aetherial wave pattern emitted during this process─a pattern we were able to emulate by passing crystal-stored aether through a specially designed prism. “We proceeded to embed said prism into an arcane simulacrum, thus completing what we have dubbed our 'artificial Atomos.'” How could I have been so blind to the possibilities? This species, not to mention its ability to summon voidsent, has been discussed among academics for years now. Just before the advent of the Seventh Umbral Calamity, we received reports of Atomos sightings from every corner of Eorzea. Surely you witnessed an appearance yourself in the course of your travels? Just before the advent of the Seventh Umbral Calamity, we received reports of Atomos sightings from every corner of Eorzea. Surely you've at least heard the tales? And still House Daemir went and built a mock Atomos of their very own. I'm not surprised the Archons consigned their work to a restricted archive. 'Twas no easy task, but at last we've unearthed the volume we've been searching for. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted to stay longer. See what other forbidden titles might be lurking on these shelves... Ah, but that would be abusing the very special privilege we've been granted now, wouldn't it? Better not.

**VARSHAHN:** The ruins alone were impressive enough, but I never dreamed such a treasure lay hidden in the depths of the Bounty... It may have been helpful to know this device existed, Your Excellency.

**ESTINIEN:** My apologies...the gate was a secret I shared with none but my closest advisors. I feared for what might happen should those with ill intentions learn of its existence.

**YSHTOLA:** What is it you're doing now?

**ESTINIEN:** There is something I wish to verify. The NOAH reports claim that a short stint into the void carries little risk of aetheric imbalance. Should one suffer an injury, however, or if one's expedition drags on longer than intended, that risk becomes significantly greater. G'raha theorized that a warding scale would confer protection from the void's corrupting influence... But I would prefer to test that hypothesis before we set foot in the Thirteenth ourselves.

**YSHTOLA:** So...this is an experiment of sorts.

**000:** Yes. An experiment... Tell me: how would *you* go about testing the efficacy of the warding scale?

**ESTINIEN:** What will you say? Might as well go myself. (Say nothing and look meaningfully at Estinien.) Maybe send a familiar?

**YSHTOLA:** And how would you do that? The gate is still too small for any of us to pass through.

**ESTINIEN:** Estinien is correct. Which is why I've elected to send a familiar in our stead.

**YSHTOLA:** What? Why are you looking at me like that? Surely you'd not expect me to wriggle through that tiny portal?

**ESTINIEN:** We needn't attempt anything so drastic. A small familiar should serve well enough. Very good. I see you've been paying attention. As Vrtra sent his simulacrum, so too shall we rely on a familiar to bear the brunt of any unpleasant consequences. Now, a lowly imp can navigate a fissure, no matter how narrow. Which means an arcane entity of similar stature should be able to manage the same. I hadn't wanted it to come to this...but no other familiars will do, I'm afraid.

**YSHTOLA:** I mislike the sound of that. What manner of fiend does she mean to summon...?

**ESTINIEN:** From ocean rise and cloudbank form,
From mountain spring and rainfall storm,
From river flow and life be born... Water, water, froth and foam!♪

**NIDHANA:** Ready your arms. I fear she's been possessed...

**NOKKEN:** Oh, come now, that was adorable!

**YSHTOLA:** Water, water, froth and foam!♪
Time to play!

**VARSHAHN:** Though not my first choice, these familiars I conceived of as a child have the best chance of fitting through the gate. ...I only wish my younger self had considered a more dignified ending to the creation ritual. In any case, these two should serve us well. This one will bear a warding scale... And when they return from the Thirteenth, we can observe how the talisman─or absence thereof─has affected the progress of the void's corruption. If I could impose upon you to open the gate, Your Excellency?

**YSHTOLA:** Ah, yes, of course...

**ESTINIEN:** We should also be wary of voidsent slipping through while we conduct our experiment. Estinien, you are to keep Nidhana safe from harm.

**YSHTOLA:** As you say...

**000:** You had best be on your guard, as well.

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? I always am. Froth and foam! ...

**NOKKEN:** And we are glad for it. Oh? Are you volunteering to join the nixies? I could shrink you down, you know... Please, just...do me a favor, and forget you ever saw that. Let us begin, shall we? Nixies! Into the void!

**YSHTOLA:** Water, water, froth and foam! Into shadowed realms we roam!

**DARKNOKKEN:** I think we've waited long enough. Nixies! Return to my side!

**YSHTOLA:** Water...water... <splutter>

**NIDHANA:** Thank you, little one. You did well.

**VOIDSENTA:** The poor thing. Its essence has been irrevocably warped...

**VOIDSENTB:** I smell you...!

**VOIDSENTC:** I cannot die... I WANT to die... Kill me... END ME...

**VOIDSENTD:** Light! I see light!

**VARSHAHN:** (-Sinister Voice-)Open! Open! OPEN!

**NIDHANA:** We're out of time! I must reseal the voidgate!

**VARSHAHN:** They're coming through!

**NIDHANA:** In the name of Alzadaal III... I bar this door unto the void!

**ESTINIEN:** Well, that was a sharp lesson in the dangers of voidgates...

**YSHTOLA:** And what of our experiment? I'd say the results speak for themselves.

**ESTINIEN:** The unprotected nixie has suffered extensive aetheric corruption. As Nidhana observed, it's well on its way to becoming a voidsent. The one merged with the talisman, however, appears unaffected. I sense no changes to its equilibrium. Rest now, little ones.

**YSHTOLA:** G'raha's theory was correct, then.

**ESTINIEN:** So it would seem. But while our second familiar was untouched by void energies, the talisman itself shows signs of degradation. It was, of course, originally designed to shield the soul from primal tempering─it stands to reason that aetheric corruption of a different sort would affect it differently. We may need to modify the warding scale's design to account for the Thirteenth's uniquely unstable aether...

**YSHTOLA:** You've said much of the void's instability, but my imagination fails me. What manner of place is this broken world?

**000:** Ah, my apologies. I forget that not all of us spend our days sequestered in dusty archives. The Thirteenth is a reflection of the Source that was drowned in a flood of Darkness. In Emet-Selch's own words, this tragedy was a result of the Ascians' attempts to force a Rejoining. They erred in their haste, and made of that world a “useless void.” You remember Unukalhai, the unusual child we met during our troubles with the Warring Triad? He explained the fate of the Thirteenth thus: The champions of that ill-fated world used the stone known as “auracite” to contain the power of primals. But those selfsame heroes were gradually corrupted by the auracite's bleeding energies, transforming into fiends with an endless hunger for aether. By the time anyone thought to oppose them, Light's strength had grown too feeble...and the balance of the Thirteenth tipped into eternal Darkness. It was Elidibus, as I recall, who rescued Unukalhai's spirit from his final battlefield. But I wonder if there were others whom the emissary saved from oblivion...

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? The barmaid at the Wandering Stairs... Ardbert's companion, the elven swordswoman...

**VARSHAHN:** The server...Cyella, wasn't it? And you say she was another of Elidibus's pawns? Cylva? The adventurer who traveled with the Warriors of Light? And you say she was another of Elidibus's pawns? I see... So Cyella, or rather, Cylva, was beguiled by the same dreams of heroism as Unukalhai. And what of your own experience? Will you tell us of what you observed during NOAH's expedition? I can picture it now... The sunless, stygian expanse, infested with legions of aether-starved monstrosities. A void in every sense of the word.

**YSHTOLA:** What you have described in such lurid detail is exactly why I hesitate to encourage you.

**NIDHANA:** Worry not, great Vrtra─our journey into the Thirteenth is but the first leg of a longer voyage. A voyage that shall lead us to other reflections─to new mysteries and discoveries─and I mean to be there every step of the way. But first I must focus on refining the warding talisman...

**VARSHAHN:** Then I can begin work on constructing an artificial Atomos. Or, I could if I had the relevant manuals to hand. Might I be so bold as to request access to the satrap's family archives? Ahem...Your Excellency?

**NIDHANA:** Hm...? Oh! Yes, that can be arranged. I will speak to my officials upon our return.

**YSHTOLA:** We will see you back in the city, then! Ah, Y'shtola! The adjustments are going well, I hope?

**NIDHANA:** 'Tis a lengthy process, but the end is in sight, yes.

**YSHTOLA:** That's wonderful news! I, myself, had some good fortune searching through the satrap's private records. What I found was a transaction log, dated around the same period as when Alzadaal's Legacy was built. It included a purchase list of highly exclusive alchemical components...and I knew I'd discovered the key to making the artificial Atomos. I then visited the High Crucible to commission the materials. After I'd explained my requirements, I was beset by volunteers insisting I allow them to help with the entire project!

**VARSHAHN:** The usual reaction to someone forcing open a voidgate is to run for the hills... Hannish academics certainly are a different breed.

**YSHTOLA:** The alchemists of old were cut from a similar cloth. The unknown held no fear for them─indeed, they were ever eager to seek new knowledge, regardless of the danger.

**VARSHAHN:** And were you not also fearless─heedless, even─in your determination?

**NAHBDEEN:** ...My sire entered his dormancy before I was hatched. And so it was Azdaja who kept my egg safe and warm. It created a bond between us. Even long after I learned to fend for myself, I rarely strayed from her side. She was my guardian, my sister, my dear companion...and not a single day passes that I do not mourn her absence. No matter how deep the darkness, I would not surrender my search. I promised myself the time would come when we would once more take to the skies together. But I am satrap now...

**VARSHAHN:** The Radiant Host is here to serve, Your Excellency!

**NAHBDEEN:** Nahbdeen. What is this about...?

**VARSHAHN:** Ser Estinien told us of your predicament. For centuries you have protected Radz-at-Han, never showing your true self. Hiding behind a curtain, and living only in service to the people... Your dedication meant more to us than your deceit, and so did we accept you as our rightful ruler. After all that you have sacrificed for this nation, did you imagine we would begrudge you your heart's desire? We survived the Final Days. We are a strong and proud people. We, the Radiant Host, will keep Thavnair safe in your absence!

**NAHBDEEN:** I am grateful for your loyalty, and for your encouragement. And yet...

**NIDHANA:** Now, you listen to me, Varshahn! You are wearing that face, after all. As I have told you before, you are a little brother to us all. And if you are family, then so, too, is your sister. We are there for you if you need us. But do not ask us to sit by and watch while you abandon a sibling you have ached to rescue for millennia!

**MEHRAHD:** We *will* succeed in opening the way─it is only a matter of time! All you need do is prepare to step through to the other side!

**000:** Your Excellency... I wanted to thank you for building the orphanage. It means so much that my sister and I will have a place to be together, safe and happy. And I hope that you and your sister can be together again, too!

**VARSHAHN:** What will you say? To protect them well, you must take heart. Will you wallow in uncertainty forever...?

**NAHBDEEN:** “Take heart, and protect them well.” Such were the words I once said to you. And here I stand, failing to live up to them. If my heart is torn, I am fit to protect neither Azdaja, nor Radz-at-Han. You're saying I should seize this chance? “Take heart, and protect them well.” Such were the words I once said to you. And here I stand, failing to live up to them. If my heart is torn, I am fit to protect neither Azdaja, nor Radz-at-Han. My people, I have come to a decision. Varshahn will depart Thavnair for a time. My dragon self will remain in the palace, but only to conduct the satrap's most essential duties. While I am focused on controlling this vessel, there may be matters that escape my attention. I rely on you, my trusted friends, to watch over one another until I return.

**VARSHAHN:** Take care and fair fortune, little brother. Many tears would be shed should you come to harm.

**SYSTEM:** I would not dare make you cry.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Meanwhile, in the Thirteenth...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ENDSINGER:** I am Nald, keeper of the realm of the living. I am Thal, keeper of the realm of the dead. Prepare to be judged, children of man. You have been found worthy.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**ESTINIEN:** (-???-)My apologies for keeping you waiting.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Vrtra, I presume.

**NIDHANA:** Indeed. This vessel now serves as a host for my eye. I was aware that the alchemists were busy preparing something, but this...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** We couldn't well send you on such a perilous mission unprepared, Your Excellency. We spared no effort in crafting the body, and I daresay you'll find it adept at wielding weapons and magicks both. 'Twas our intent to present it to you sooner, but we could not bring ourselves to do so knowing we could yet improve it further. Pray forgive us...

**NAHBDEEN:** There is naught to forgive. I am grateful for this fine vessel, and shall put it to good use. Again, I ask that you watch over Radz-at-Han in my absence. The dangers we go to face are great and many, and I fear I will be unable to give matters here due attention. And in opening the voidgate, there is ever risk that voidsent will find their way into our world...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Rest assured we are more than prepared. Our soldiers have been training under Master Estinien. On my honor, we will not suffer a single fiend to pass. So think only of your mission, Varshahn. Ah, but seeing as this is a different body, perhaps we should use a different name?

**NAHBDEEN:** Nay, Varshahn shall suffice. Though I may have thus grown up, I am as ever a little brother to you all.

**YSHTOLA:** As you say, as you say. Go then, Varshahn, and best of luck!

**VARSHAHNBIG:** I have something for you as well. While you were gone, Urianger paid us a visit. As you may recall, he joined us on our foray into Alzadaal's Legacy in part to conduct research for the Loporrits. Research they were delighted to receive, and which has already inspired them to consider new ways to improve their own treasure vault. As a token of their gratitude, Livingway entrusted a familiar relic to Urianger... Aye, the crystal which showed the way to Meteion.  The Loporrits no longer have need of it, and thus saw fit to return it to us. Harboring the power of Light, it could well aid us in our mission in the void. And who better to bear Hydaelyn's gift than Her chosen champion?

**YSHTOLA:** If there is nothing left to discuss, then let us depart. Our boat awaits us in Akyaali. I shall now lift the seal. In the name of Alzadaal III... I cast open this door unto the void!

**ESTINIEN:** Go! Absorb the voidgate! It worked. We should have no trouble passing through a gate of that size.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** What can we expect to find after stepping through?

**YSHTOLA:** On my previous foray, I emerged in a castle swarming with voidsent. I was hopelessly outnumbered and forced to turn back. But together, I am confident we can hold our own. Upon our arrival, let us deal with any hostile entities and secure the area. The command of our mission, I leave in your capable hands. In the event of battle, I shall adapt my tactics to complement your own.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Should we require healing, I can provide it. 'Twould be a welcome change of pace from my recent havoc wreaking.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** Take heart, my friends, and have faith. We will brave this broken world and rescue my sister Azdaja!

**ESTINIEN:** Ssso the gate *did* open again. And delivered the most mouthwatering morselsss... I am Scarmiglione─archfiend of earth, and first of Golbez's circle of four! Sssuch pleasure I will take in delivering you unto your graves! Urrrgh... My flesssh...

**YSHTOLA:** This Scarmiglione─he *knew* the gate had opened.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** And not for the first time. He and his brethren must keep watch over the portal.

**ESTINIEN:** As we do ours. But to unflinchingly consume a fellow voidsent... Like men, perhaps they form factions and fight amongst themselves.

**YSHTOLA:** The question is, what will the minions do? Your mistress is no more, and the one who consumed her we slew in turn. Do you still mean to try us?

**ESTINIEN:** I expect some voidsent are more intelligent than others. Perhaps these ones simply do not understand our words.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Hmph. Even beasts ought to understand strength.

**000:** There is much we do not know about voidsent. If we are to survive their world, 'twould be wise to learn their ways.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** What will you say? Let's proceed with caution and pick up what we can. Don't overthink it─we'll improvise as we go along.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Sage advice, my friend. 'Tis reassuring to have one so experienced with us. If that is your preferred approach, then very well. I shall defer to your adventurer's intuition. I am here, Sister. Finally here. And I will find you─I swear it...

**000:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)You... (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)You are...the friend?

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? You're the voidsent bound to Zenos! Didn't you fade away when Zenos fell?

**ESTINIEN:** I see it now. The bottomless darkness. The insatiable hunger. The aura was present when we faced him in Garlemald.

**YSHTOLA:** How did it come to be here?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** When Zenos died, its connection to the Source was severed. It was forced to return to the void.

**YSHTOLA:** Zenos? The disgraced prince you yourself laid low?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I see it now. The bottomless darkness. The insatiable hunger. The aura was present when we faced him in Garlemald. When Zenos died, its connection to the Source was severed. It was forced to return to the void.

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Zenos... (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Yes, that was his name. And you *are* the friend, are you not?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Is that...Hydaelyn's crystal!?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)But how? (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)The light just now... Of course. And thus I am returned...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What do you mean, “returned”? Who are you?

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)I was once bound to the man named Zenos. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)His “avatar”─until you killed him.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** “Avatar” as in the voidsent servants of reapers. “Avatar” as in the voidsent servants of reapers. In the name of his hunt, Zenos took up that traditional Garlean art. And through it, he forged a covenant with a being of the void to lend him strength.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)“Covenant”? A curse, more like. He stole my power. There was no equity in the arrangement. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)My very essence was altered. Twisted into a tool to serve his desires.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Your previous appearance. This is your true form, then?

**ESTINIEN:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Perhaps. Perhaps not. What does it matter?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Indeed. It doesn't. Regardless of your form, you are a voidsent by nature. So answer me this: are you our enemy too?

**ESTINIEN:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)In this world, only a fool would attempt to devour a stronger being. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)And though it was as an avatar, I lost to you once. I have no desire to lose again.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Good enough for me.

**000:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Now, you will answer me a question. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Zenos called you “friend.” That's what you are? A friend?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? Strictly speaking, I'm _WARRIOR_OF_LIGHT_. Whatever Zenos may have said, I wasn't his friend. Not to you. At least, not yet.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)So...you're not a friend? (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Then... (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)What is it? What is a friend?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Report if displayed.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)This is where I belong. My home. This endless darkness you call the void... (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)There was once light here, and it shone its warmth upon creation. The lands were green and the seas were blue. Life flourished. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Before the war. The Contramemoria.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** It must have been a terrible war indeed...

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)It shattered the balance, causing Darkness to engulf the world. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)All life was transformed into monstrosities─voidsent. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)*We* are the natural order now.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** As Light begat sin eaters, Darkness begat voidsent.

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)The sun was driven from the sky as fleeting day yielded to endless night. In time, even land and sea lost their distinction. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)And though the spark of reason had died in us, driven by memory's shadow, we formed factions and carved out domains. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)This castle, for instance. Its erstwhile lord must have abided in such a place once upon a time.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** If I may... The Darkness in you is too much for any man to harbor; to my eyes, you are indeed a voidsent. Yet your knowledge of the past and your demeanor mark you apart from your brethren. You are different, that much is plain. But in what way, I am unsure.

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)As you say, I am voidsent. But only in part. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)The Darkness touched my mother when the war had only just begun. When I was still in the womb. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)As a child, I looked like any other. But Darkness coursed through me, and I ceased to age when I'd become a woman grown. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)But that was then, and now...I may as well be one in full. (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)I prey on the weak and serve the strong. I live to survive. Nothing more.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Forgive me, 'twas not my intent to pry... I realize, too, that I've neglected to ask your name.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)As we say “mortal,” you may call me “voidsent.”

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** That is liable to cause confusion. If you are not averse, we would address you by your true name.

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Then call me what you will. I care not.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** How about...“Zero”?

**YSHTOLA:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)Meaning “nothing”? A name as fitting as any.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** No, not “nothing,” but rather a “beginning.” For it remains to be seen what you will become to us.

**000:** (-Dark-robed Voidsent-)As I said, I care not. Zero, then.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? Here's to a fruitful partnership. I think it's a nice name.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Partnership...? Are you saying you wish to strike a bargain? A name is a string of sounds. Its meaning has no bearing on my nature.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Well, Zero. While there is no end to the questions we could ask, 'tis only fair that we tell you our purpose in coming here. We are searching for a dragon, one who came to your world long ago.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** A dragon?

**EARTHMONOLITH:** Yes. Azdaja is her name, and she is my sister. If you have any knowledge of her, I beg you share it with us.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** (-???-)Hissssss...

**ESTINIEN:** Did you say something?

**YSHTOLA:** No...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I thought I heard a voice as well. The keening of voidsent, perhaps...

**YSHTOLA:** This place is as good as any. Let me have the aether now.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** Very well.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** (-???-)Hissssss... (-???-)You're mine!

**EARTHMONOLITH:** Report if displayed. 

**ESTINIEN:** Ahhh, that I should miss my mark...

**EARTHMONOLITH:** That fiend again? But we struck it down─watched it die!

**YSHTOLA:** Fools. Death doesn't exissst in this world. And I─I am free to return whensoever I please.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Death doesn't exist...? Report if displayed. Of course. In the First, the power of Light─of passivity─prevents life from emerging in the Empty. But in the Thirteenth, the power of Darkness─of activity─prevents life from finding rest, even should soul be separated from flesh.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** So unless one's essence is absorbed by another, 'tis possible to return again and again...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Hm... Your aether─it is reminissscent of that creature's. Ahhh, my mouth waters at the memory...

**EARTHMONOLITH:** What?

**ESTINIEN:** I must devour you too. Yes, I must! Ye drifting souls, by my power be reborn!

**YSHTOLA:** If it's another death they want, I say we give it to them.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** If you could lend us a hand, we'd be much obliged.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** That you would. But you already owe me a debt, and until you make good on it, I won't lift a finger. We'll speak after you have won. But know that if you lose, I'll help myself to your aether.

**YSHTOLA:** That a bothersome duty should deliver to me this lavish feassst... Come, struggle with all your might! It will make you that much richer and tastier! When will you learn? No matter what you do, you cannot hope to win.

**ESTINIEN:** You never know until you try, and I'm always happy to experiment.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero─is there no way to stop them from coming back?

**ESTINIEN:** There is. But I have no reason to share it with you.

**YSHTOLA:** Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You know, Zero. You do owe us for one thing. Your name. You'll have your promised aether, but we are owed compensation for your name.

**YSHTOLA:** A name for which I did not ask... But that I nevertheless did accept. Report if displayed.

**ESTINIEN:** They've been crystallized!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Well now, that's quite the trick.

**YSHTOLA:** Satisfied?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Completely.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** Come, my friends. With Zero's aid, we can defeat him!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What is this!? What have you done!?

**EARTHMONOLITH:** Now that I think on it, you owe me a debt as well. You may have missed your mark...but I won't miss mine. Report if displayed.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Fools! Do not think you have defeated me! I will return, again and again! What? My flesh... Why won't it heal? What is the meaning of thisss!? To seal aether in crystal... Report if displayed. Memoria!? But how? How can you have this power? Death has no place in this world. We are beyond it...and yet... Ah, Lord Golbez! You have sent me to my doom! Curse you and your wretched flattery, and this abominable fate!

**WATERMONOLITH:** (-Knight in Black-)You are well come, seekers of might. I, Golbez, have called you four hither... I who would see us triumph in the coming crusade... That I may entrust you with command of our armies.

**EARTHMONOLITH:** (-Spirited Voidsent-)Yes, yes, but what of the promised gift?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Shifty Voidsent-)In exchange for our loyalty, we are to feast on the finest aether.

**WINDMONOLITH:** And so you shall. For if you are to serve me, you must be strong.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Alluring Voidsent-)Then honor the pact, and pray we are not disappointed.

**FIREMONOLITH:** Very well. Behold.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Dignified Voidsent-)The fiery wings, the savage horns...it pulses with life! Such vibrant aether! (-Dignified Voidsent-)This magnificent creature could only come from beyond the veil.

**ESTINIEN:** Indeed. Feast, my friends. Feast, and arise as my four archfiends! As they are now, they can consume but a fraction of the dragon's aether. Just as well. The creature may yet serve other ends.

**YSHTOLA:** Are you all right?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** The voidsent's essence remains. But it has been sealed away─transformed into crystal.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** “Memoria,” Scarmiglione called them. I take it they are connected to the war of which you spoke.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Aye─their use was central to the Contramemoria, hence its name. And to my knowledge, the transformation is permanent.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I see. We thank you for coming to our aid.

**YSHTOLA:** I repaid a debt, and in doing so ensured that I receive my own due compensation. Which I shall have now.

**ESTINIEN:** Yes, yes. I still have work to do, so I would thank you not to get carried away.

**YSHTOLA:** Aether as the coin of choice. I appreciate the simplicity.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Report if displayed. That makes us even, I trust. Right, then─when you picked up the crystal, you experienced a vision, did you not?

**ESTINIEN:** A dragon resembling a great wyrm? I dare to hope that it was Azdaja... Even as it pains me to think she has been made to suffer.

**YSHTOLA:** For the ambitions of this Golbez...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We've been given much to consider. Let us a take a moment to review what we know.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** There it is. Good, it agrees to serve. Get on.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What is this place?

**YSHTOLA:** My domain. In the beginning, it was a sanctuary for me alone. But over time, others began to gather here. Those who had nowhere else to go.

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTA:** A settlement of pariahs...

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTB:** What's that?

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTC:** Mortals! They're mortals!

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTD:** What enticing aether!

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTA:** Let me have some! Let me have some!

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTB:** <whimper>

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTC:** They're all hers?

**VILLAGEVOIDSENTD:** Ack, it's not fair...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I-I don't want to be eaten!

**SYSTEM:** You are under my protection here and will not be harmed. I give you my word. Follow me.

**FIREMONOLITH:** Meanwhile, elsewhere...

**SPYVOIDSENT:** (-Throne of Fire-)Not only did the mortals conquer Troia─they defeated Scarmiglione? (-Throne of Fire-)I struggle to believe it...

**FIREMONOLITH:** (-Spy's Voice-)There is more, my lords. They were aided by one of our world, who transformed Scarmiglione's soul into crystal!

**WATERMONOLITH:** (-Throne of Fire-)Crystal!? This one speaks of memoria!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Throne of Water-)Now there's a word I've not heard for an age. It'd bring a pang of nostalgia to my breast and a tear to my eye... (-Throne of Water-)...If the very notion wasn't absurd! The gifted are gone, drowned in Darkness─as were we all!

**WATERMONOLITH:** And yet Scarmiglione still does not answer. Were he alive, he would have returned by now. Weakest though he was, his ability to regenerate was without peer.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Throne of Water-)Hmph!

**WINDMONOLITH:** If this account is true─if a memoriate has survived... They cannot be suffered to live.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Throne of Wind-)Leave this matter to me, Lord Golbez. (-Barbariccia-)I, Barbariccia, shall strike down any who pose a threat to our plans.

**WINDMONOLITH:** 'Tis true you are a proven commander, well suited to leading an assault.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Barbariccia-)And when I have succeeded, I would beg a boon of you.

**WINDMONOLITH:** What do you desire?

**FIREMONOLITH:** (-Barbariccia-)The dragon's aether. All that remains.

**WINDMONOLITH:** (-Throne of Fire-)The insolence! Know your place!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Barbariccia-)With respect, my locks are free as the wind. Without incentive to sway them, I know not whither they will blow.

**WINDMONOLITH:** Boldly spoken. I trust you will not disappoint me.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Barbariccia-)Upon this flowing hair and my immortal soul, I will not fail.

**WINDMONOLITH:** Then go, and impress upon these interlopers the futility of defiance.

**FORMERMINIONVOIDSENT:** (-Barbariccia-)My lord!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Report if displayed. B-Barbariccia... She is come!

**FORMERMINIONVOIDSENT:** And she's brought her domain with her. The archfiend's after you and yours, I shouldn't doubt. Perhaps you should go and find them. But be warned─whatever this is about, do not expect us to get involved.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I can't bear it... Eating and being eaten... I only want to be left in peace...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** You and me both.

**YSHTOLA:** One of the archfiends approaches?

**ESTINIEN:** They must have been tracking our movements.

**WINDMONOLITH:** She's here!

**ESTINIEN:** Excellent. You've saved me the trouble of traveling to Troia.

**WINDMONOLITH:** So you're Barbariccia. 

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Mind your manners, mortal! My name is not to be spoken save in reverence and fear. And what is this pitiful domain? Pitiful wretches all. I will put you out of your misery! Alas, poor Scarmiglione, and good riddance. Felled by outsiders in pursuit of what, pray tell?

**WINDMONOLITH:** A dragon─one who crossed to this world thousands of years ago. Know you aught of it?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** A dragon, you say? Hahaha... Ahahahaha! My Lord Golbez is more clever than I realized. To let the prize live that it might lure more prey to us. Very well. In gratitude and service, I shall devour every last mote of their souls.

**WINDMONOLITH:** Where is she? Where is Azdaja!?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Heh, you even share its scent. How curious...and irresistible! 

**ESTINIEN:** Report if displayed.

**WINDMONOLITH:** If you think us easy prey, you're wrong.

**ESTINIEN:** Unlike Scarmiglione, I need not skulk in shadow to claim what is mine. If you would know about the dragon you seek, then enter into my domain. You may flee instead if you wish─if the fate of the sorry lot here is of no concern to you. One way or another, I will have satisfaction.

**000:** What's the plan, then?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** What will you say? Go after Barbariccia─what else? If we go, we'd be playing into her hands.

**ESTINIEN:** Indeed. Yet she will have the upper hand in her domain. We must be no less than fully prepared.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Aye, that we would. Even so, we don't have any intention of turning tail now, do we? We find her and get our answers. Will you be joining us, Zero?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** You may be easily goaded into accepting her challenge, but my curiosity is not so insatiable as to cloud my judgment. Nevertheless, if you are desperate for my aid...you know my price.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I shall pay it. So long as you leave me strength enough to see my sister home, you may take as much as you wish. And lest you forget, mine is no ordinary aether. Barbariccia too recognized its potency.

**ESTINIEN:** ...Very well. We have a bargain.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You're not the only ones who can ride the wind!

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Report if displayed.

**YSHTOLA:** Leave these ones to us!

**WINDMONOLITH:** Aye! See to Barbariccia!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Come! Give yourselves to my scouring winds that I may feast upon your essence! No... I will not be denied... There's still time... With more of the dragon's aether, I can yet...

**WINDMONOLITH:** You're finished.

**YSHTOLA:** Report if displayed. Damn it aaaaaall!

**ESTINIEN:** I see you've bested Barbariccia. Well done.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Her minions, too, are all crystallized or scattered. The day is ours.

**ESTINIEN:** What of my sister? Tell me you learned something about Azdaja! So the archfiend and her crystal yielded naught...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Our efforts have not been entirely fruitless. We have deprived your sister's captor of another powerful champion. With Zero, we may yet challenge Golbez and his minions.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Indeed, we could not have come this far without your aid. Thank you, Zero.

**YSHTOLA:** I but fulfilled my part of the bargain. And now I will have my...my... Report if displayed.

**ESTINIEN:** Her aether is nearly spent. Perhaps unsurprising given how much power she used.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** I wouldn't want to face another archfiend without her. We should hurry back to Zero's domain.

**NAHBDEEN:** Agreed. Eager though I am to continue, 'twould be unwise to risk our lives for the sake of haste. Let us suspend the mission and tend to Zero.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Ahhh, you're all safe! Thank the Sisters!

**NAHBDEEN:** A moment while I close the gate. ...There. We may rest easy for now. Was there any trouble? I expect some voidsent slipped through...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** A few did, aye, but we were ready and dealt with them without incident.

**NAHBDEEN:** That is well. I cannot thank you enough for your vigilance.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Yes, yes, you're grateful. But aren't you forgetting something more important? You know...the polite-but-warm formalities one delights in hearing when their little brother returns from a long journey.

**NAHBDEEN:** Indeed, you are right. Ahem. It is good to be home again, among those whom I love dearly and missed so much.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** And we are glad to receive you, Varshahn! Welcome home!

**ESTINIEN:** Chambers have been prepared for your use at Meghaduta. Let us take Zero there at once. Our mission took many an unexpected turn. I am relieved that we have all returned safely. But before you all enjoy the rest you have earned a dozen times over, I would consult you on one last matter.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Zero.

**YSHTOLA:** While she appears none the worse for wear, she remains locked in slumber, and I cannot help but worry. Is there aught we can do to expedite her recovery? If her aether is exhausted, perhaps I can share some of mine now...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** In the wastelands of the Thirteenth, one can only replenish aether by taking it from others, be it by trade or by force. In contrast, the Source is rich in ambient aether. Simply being here and drawing breath, Zero will absorb what she needs.

**YSHTOLA:** Then we need but wait?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** I believe so. She will awaken in time, and when she does, give her something to eat. Judging by her form, she should also be able to derive nourishment from food. I know you promised her your aether, but perhaps she might appreciate fine Hannish cuisine more.

**ESTINIEN:** Food can certainly be arranged.

**YSHTOLA:** She looks like any other person. Unsurprising, perhaps, given that she is only part voidsent.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Zero said before that Zenos had altered her essence. A change wrought, I suspect, with the power of Darkness. It acted upon the part of her that is voidsent, rendering it dominant. Thus we were able to reverse it with the power of Light. I labor to believe that Zenos possessed such arcane knowledge. In all likelihood, it came from Fandaniel. Were Zero wholly voidsent, I doubt the crystal would have had an effect on her. One might say that Hydaelyn had a hand in your meeting.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** 'Tis no exaggeration to say that Zero has proven herself invaluable─a boon from Hydaelyn Herself. Her cooperation may come at a price, but whatever it is, I am willing to pay it. Exhausting though it may be at times.

**NIDHANA:** Light...? Is this...an inn? What happened? How did I get here? There's no time. I must rejoin the battle. I must...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You're awake! Wonderful!

**NIDHANA:** Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Report if displayed.

**NIDHANA:** What is this!? Some sort of fiend!?

**VARSHAHN:** A fiend!? Where is it!? Where!? Ack, but this is no time for jokes... You're in the Source, my dear─the world next door, so to speak. The others brought you here after you collapsed. I'll fetch them at once. Wait just a moment!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I took the liberty of arranging refreshments. I hope you find them as flavorful as they are invigorating.

**NIDHANA:** This isn't what you promised. But I suppose aether is aether...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Wait, wait, wait! Don't tell me you don't know how to eat?

**NIDHANA:** I took what I needed from it. What's the problem?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Where's the enjoyment in that? You're supposed to bite, to chew, to savor, and then swallow!

**NIDHANA:** Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** That's the way! So...did it taste good?

**YSHTOLA:** I...don't know.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The long years without eating may have dulled your sense of taste.

**NIDHANA:** Well, we voidsent have no need for such when consuming others. There are some who speak of “taste” when describing the quality and affinity of their prey's aether... But I loathe the act. Taking aether in small amounts like this is one thing, but diluting my essence─diminishing myself? I'd sooner die. And I have died. Countless times.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You have? Um...but what happens when you do?

**NIDHANA:** Not much. After a while, you return, together with all your expended life force. The important thing is to die where others won't devour you.

**VARSHAHN:** Amazing! My peers who study immortality and resurrection would be most interested in this phenomenon!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The question of taste aside, I am glad that you are able to partake of food like us. I daresay it agrees with your personal preferences.

**VARSHAHN:** That's true. You can keep giving me the same on a regular basis.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Very well. As my guest, I shall see that you do not want for comfort. And one other thing... We brought you to our world without your consent, and for that I apologize. If you wish it, we will return you to yours once you have regained your strength.

**VARSHAHN:** ...It's fine. I have no reason to go back. ...Except for yours, perhaps. You intend to cross over again, I take it?

**YSHTOLA:** I do. I have yet to find my sister. I want nothing more than to rush to her aid─to find this Golbez and free her from his clutches, if he still holds her captive.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Though if our recent experience has taught us anything, 'tis that the Thirteenth is more dangerous than we ever imagined. Caution must be our watchword.

**VARSHAHN:** Better late than never. In the short time you spent in our world, you left a trail of chaos in your wake. You managed to return in one piece this time, but don't assume you'll be so lucky the next.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Rest assured we will make no assumptions and spare no preparation. Speaking of which, while we rest and ready ourselves, I ask that you tell me more about your home. In return, I will tell you about ours. I will show you my domain, Radz-at-Han.

**VARSHAHN:** Again a stranger in this strange land... I have a condition. You must come too.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You have my thanks. So, what are your impressions of Radz-at-Han?

**VARSHAHN:** There's a lot of mortals.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Considering your origin, I can see why that might be your first observation. Though they would call each other “people,” I think. If you wish to know about our fair city, I should be glad to place a guide at your disposal.

**VARSHAHN:** No need─I'll show myself around. There's only so much about my home I can share with you in return, after all. While I remember some few tales of the past, I cannot speak to their authenticity. But if that is enough, then I will tell you of the events that saw Darkness engulf our world─the Contramemoria.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We are all ears. Please.

**YSHTOLA:** Long ago, Light filled the world, and all was at peace. But then the servants of Darkness came, and they bequeathed a black art unto men. Channeling the power of hope and prayer, one could call forth fearsome beings known as eidolons.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The Ascians. And these eidolons are surely primals.

**YSHTOLA:** Then you have faced the same, and understand that when an eidolon is birthed, strife follows. And in such strife, the weak are first to suffer. When it seemed the world would be plunged into chaos, heroes appeared─they who were blessed with a singular power. The power to bind the aether of eidolons within crystals known as memoria. My mother was one such memoriate. But in fighting to save many, she herself was touched by Darkness─as was I.

**VARSHAHN:** And so you were born part voidsent. Before the world was overcome?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** How exactly did that calamity come to pass? Did the memoriates not triumph?

**ESTINIEN:** They did. They expunged the seeds of chaos and restored the peace...only to find themselves seduced by the Darkness they had sealed. They spread the taint, transforming men into monsters─what you call voidsent─and raised armies to wage new wars.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Not the first to be corrupted by power─nor the last.

**YSHTOLA:** Some defied temptation and held fast to the Light, my mother and I among them. For years and years we fought, but it was not enough. And when our strength was spent, our bulwarks broken, so too was the world.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The Flood of Darkness...

**VARSHAHN:** The stars faded from the heavens as a pall black as pitch enveloped creation. Darkness raged unchecked, rending the very walls of reality. I was cast into the rift, and there trapped for what felt like an eternity. Until I came upon a crack. Tiny, infinitesimal─but enough for me to squeeze through... ...And find my world changed beyond recognition. Into the lightless waste you saw.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** So that is how you were able to escape becoming a voidsent in full.

**YSHTOLA:** I suppose I should consider myself fortunate. Were I like most others, I wouldn't have lasted a day before being devoured. We the lost are better equipped to survive in a lost world.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** A lost world, you say? I wouldn't be so sure. The Thirteenth is still there, is it not?

**YSHTOLA:** What are you getting at?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** To explain requires that we initiate you into the truth of the Source and its reflections. Be warned that this will take a while...

**YSHTOLA:** Then...unlike the worlds that have been rejoined, mine still...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The Oracle of Light prevented the First from being completely overcome, so the situation may not be completely identical to that of your Thirteenth. But the fact remains that we were able to restore a measure of balance to a world brought to the brink of destruction. After which, some intrepid young souls succeeded in restoring life back to lands thought lost to Light. Which gives me cause to hope the day may yet come when life springs forth anew in the Thirteenth. Which gives me cause to hope there may be a way to restore Light and life to the Thirteenth. Of course, these are only possibilities. I offer no guarantees. But having experienced what we have, I daresay we are more qualified than most to speak on the matter.

**ESTINIEN:** Wait, I don't understand. Why would you say these things? As if you mean to...  But the sole reason you came to the void was...

**VARSHAHN:** To find a dragon, aye. And in light of what we've seen, we'd be fools to strive for more. But we Scions─former Scions, begging your pardon─have a habit of not leaving well enough alone. And old habits die hard, don't they, my friend?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Restoring the Light would serve our efforts to find and free Azdaja. There is no reason not to try.

**VARSHAHN:** ...Do as you will. I have no desire to save that world.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Be that as it may, we will have need of your power when next we face voidsent.

**SYSTEM:** Report if displayed. You know how it works. If you want my help, you must pay my price. And now that you've drawn Golbez's attention, it's going to cost you more. A lot more. I will consider this a deposit.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Meanwhile, elsewhere...

**FIREMONOLITH:** First Scarmiglione, and now Barbariccia... Useless, the both of them.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Throne of Fire-)'Twas no lie─they conspire with a memoriate.

**FIREMONOLITH:** And their search for the dragon will lead them here. The war looms nigh. We cannot allow these interlopers to interfere.

**WATERMONOLITH:** (-Throne of Fire-)If I may, my lord, I have a plan to eliminate them. (-Throne of Fire-)In order to guarantee its success, however, I will require Cagnazzo's cooperation.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Cagnazzo-)If there's sport to be had, then I'll play along. As much as I dislike following your lead, I have no patience for scheming.

**FIREMONOLITH:** Well and good to have confidence, but do not forget the cost of failure.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Throne of Fire-)Rest assured I will see the dream to fruition. Even should I be consumed by my own flames, I will pave the way for one and all.

**FIREMONOLITH:** Then I will trust in your oath and your plan.

**WATERMONOLITH:** (-Throne of Fire-)We will give you cause to rejoice, my lord. This I vow.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** (-Cagnazzo-)Heh heh, some excitement for a change!



---------------------------------------------------------------------




---------------------------------------------------------------------

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Everyone is so...carefree. Unafraid and unconcerned in spite of their weakness, and how easily their lives could be torn apart in an instant... Such luxuries are lost to us. We have no hopes or dreams─not even the release of death. Only hunger. Others are a means to an end. At times a literal one. We forge covenants with men, and come here to feed. Or to die. I thought it would be no different when I was summoned by Zenos. Lives were tools to him, to be used and discarded at whim. In that respect, he was a voidsent at heart. But towards you and you alone, he behaved...differently. And I cannot fathom why. What was it that drove him? What made him choose such an end? But enough about that man. He is dead, and we are all better for it. Why are you here? Was there something you needed? So you're heading back now. Then as per our bargain, I will go as well.

**ESTINIEN:** Everyone is here? Good. Let us set forth for the void once more.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** What is it? He's...calling.

**YSHTOLA:** What is the meaning of this...?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Unless I'm mistaken, that was intended for one of your kin. Who?

**ESTINIEN:** It was for the briefest of moments, but...I felt her. Azdaja.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** I thought she was in the void.

**YSHTOLA:** As did I. Yet the presence was unmistakable. Thus did I call out...only for it to fade and vanish.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Perhaps...she crossed over to the Source then immediately turned back?

**YSHTOLA:** I do not know... Could she have found a way home...?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** The how of it aside, if she was indeed in the Source, there may be clues where she came through that could lead us back to her. Where exactly was it that you felt her presence?

**ESTINIEN:** Far to the north. That was all I could discern.

**YSHTOLA:** The north, you say? Beyond the Bounty─Garlemald?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** As good a place to start as any. My apologies, Zero, but your return to the void will have to wait.

**YSHTOLA:** I told you before that I have no reason to go back there. Do as you will.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** ...All right. I presume you wish to stay here in Radz–at–Han until we return?

**YSHTOLA:** You've kept me amply fed. I wouldn't be averse to helping you on your search.

**ESTINIEN:** If Azdaja was indeed here, other voidsent may have made the journey as well... Very well, we would welcome your company.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** If it's decided, then I'll contact our associates in Garlemald. ...It's me. Still talking everyone's ears off, I trust? Understood. We'll see you there. We're to rendezvous at Tertium. We'll need to teleport to make it there in time. Can you?

**ESTINIEN:** Aye. I know it well from my time as an avatar.

**YSHTOLA:** Then it seems we're all set.

**ESTINIEN:** If there is nothing else, let us see to our final preparations.

**ALPHINAUD:** Any moment now...

**YSHTOLA:** My friends, 'tis good to see you again.

**ALISAIE:** And you. I was worried that the cold wouldn't agree with you, but you're both looking quite well.

**YSHTOLA:** You get used to it. It helps that there's no shortage of fuel and heaters like before.

**ALPHINAUD:** Glad to hear it. Have you been working in Garlemald all this time?

**ALISAIE:** We have. Though the worst is behind them, the people still have a long road ahead. They've taken steps towards forming an interim government, but it will be some time before any large-scale reconstruction effort can be carried out in earnest. With the nation in ruins and the leadership void yet to be filled, there remains a lack of direction─a pervasive sense of aimlessness and worry.

**000:** So we'll keep doing what we can until they can finally stand on their own. Still, everyone wants to make things better, and we're here to help. A lot of Garleans wanted nothing to do with us, but they're starting to come around. Slowly but surely.

**ALPHINAUD:** What will you say? You're doing a fine job. It sounds like quite the undertaking.

**ALISAIE:** You're too kind. But it's thanks to the cooperation of like-minded souls that we've been able to make any progress. Indeed, it has not been easy. But we've been able to make progress thanks to the cooperation of like-minded souls. The allied nations continue to send supplies which allow us to meet basic needs such as food and shelter. Meanwhile, Jullus and a number of soldiers have begun a restoration initiative, with more and more volunteers joining by the day.

**ALPHINAUD:** Like Alphinaud said, they've got a long road ahead of them. But we'll get there together─one step at a time.

**ALISAIE:** Though you yourself helped them take one especially big step, didn't you? In vanquishing that blasphemy in the Tower of Babil. Thank you. I can only hope that your deed will help the people to find peace and closure.

**YSHTOLA:** But enough about events here. What brings you to us? And with new company besides.

**ALISAIE:** This may take rather a long time to explain, but bear with me...

**ALPHINAUD:** The Thirteenth!? After traveling to the edge of existence, I thought you'd keep your escapades closer to home for a while... But I suppose there's no stopping you. Not that I'm one to talk, of course...

**ALISAIE:** The heart of an adventurer cannot be denied. The heart of an adventurer cannot be denied.

**000:** You could have at least invited me too! Surely there was room enough for me and G'raha in the undersea vault?

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? Sorry... I thought you were busy...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Oh, it's fine. You can make it up to me on the next one. I know, I know. I only meant to tease. Mostly... But on a more serious note... Are we sure it's wise to keep Zenos's former avatar around? I understand how you came to work together, but nevertheless...

**ALISAIE:** You're right to be cautious. I'm a voidsent after all. But do not conflate me with Zenos. To recall my time in his service─it...angers me...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Is that so... I think we'll get along just fine, you and I.

**ALPHINAUD:** Now that we are all caught up, to the matter at hand. As we were about to resume our search in the void, I felt the presence of my sister Azdaja in the Source. Somewhere in the far north─perhaps even here in Garlemald. If you have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary, I must know.

**YSHTOLA:** As a matter of fact, we may have. In recent days, we have had to contend with a surprising number of voidsent. And not the lesser kind that occasionally manifest, but ones possessed of considerable power.

**ALPHINAUD:** You think they might have been summoned? By whom?

**ESTINIEN:** We're not sure. But as Jullus reminded us, practitioners of a certain traditional Garlean art rely upon voidsent servants. The very same I believe you have mastered. While there are no known reapers left in Garlemald, we can't rule out the possibility that some are working in secret.

**YSHTOLA:** To summon not one, but several powerful voidsent, is no small feat. But if Azdaja was indeed called from the void...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Then it is likely the same party is responsible. Alternatively, the aetheric confluence at the Tower of Babil may have triggered an expansion of natural fissures one could use to cross over, but I think that improbable if not impossible.

**ALISAIE:** Then we must assume these events have indeed been orchestrated.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Well, summoned or no, we've been trying to track them to their origin. It's the mountains to the east, we think.

**ALPHINAUD:** Can you guide us there?

**ESTINIEN:** I would, but the terrain is too difficult to traverse on foot. Nor is flying an option due to the winds.

**ALPHINAUD:** Too much ground to cover in any case. Is there no way to narrow it down?

**YSHTOLA:** There is one place we thought to look first: an isolated village rumored to have once been home to a reaper order.

**ALPHINAUD:** That would indeed make an excellent start. Though the question of how to get there remains.

**ALISAIE:** Jullus may be of assistance. Let us return to Camp Broken Glass and consult him.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What was it you wished to talk about?

**ALISAIE:** Why do you help these people? What is it that you stand to gain?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I'm sorry?

**ALISAIE:** You don't act on behalf of a higher power, nor are you bound by a contract. In spite of this, you help them. Why?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** And there I thought it was something serious... I help them because I want to. Because it's the right thing to do.

**ALISAIE:** ...But what do you stand to gain? You didn't answer the question.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Didn't I? I followed my heart. What I got out of it came after. Was there anything else? If not, let's keep moving.

**ALISAIE:** ...Right. To act not out of obligation or in pursuit of gain. To simply...live. And they survive like this...?

**000:** All finished, are we? Good. The cold doesn't let up out here, does it... They've the means to keep everyone warm at Camp Broken Glass and Tertium. But the measures are still only temporary. Subsisting on charity, dreading the day the sympathy of others is exhausted─it's no way to live. They need lasting safety and security. Though things will never be as they once were... If we can restore a modicum of normalcy to their lives, maybe that will be enough for them to move forward. If we're to achieve that, we have to work harder. I have to work harder.

**ALISAIE:** What will you say? You're doing your best. Anyone can see that. Just try not to overdo it, eh?

**SYSTEM:**  Report if displayed. L-Lest you misunderstand, I wasn't fishing for a compliment... As I said, I'm doing this because I want to. Still...I appreciate your support. Oh, come now, you think I don't know my own limits? Still...I appreciate your concern. Well, our work here is done. We should be heading back. I hope Alphinaud and Zero haven't gotten into any trouble. I cannot imagine how awful it must have been to serve as Zenos's avatar. To not only suffer him, but so much else... She's a fighter all right. Like you and me.

**HUNGARYGARLEAN10320:** Meanwhile, at Tertium...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Thank you, miss. Thank you.

**RESTLESSGARLEAN10320:** This feels...strangely familiar...

**ALPHINAUD:** Excuse me, Alphinaud. My wife, she's come down with a high fever. Do you think you could take a look at her?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Of course. Give me a moment. Zero, may I leave the rest here to you?

**JULLUS:** Fine by me.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Thank you again for your help. Er...Zero, was it? I take it you're one of Alphinaud's comrades?

**JULLUS:** Comrade...? We've entered into a cooperative pact, if that's what you mean.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Pact? No, no, nothing so formal. What I mean is, you must know each other well. Be on good terms, enjoy each other's company─that sort of thing.

**JULLUS:** Then no, he's not my comrade. I have none. Nor will I ever, I think.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Oh...

**JULLUS:** Did I say something odd?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** No, not at all. On the contrary, it makes sense. When Alphinaud and the contingent first arrived, we rejected them out of hand. Whatever they may have claimed, they were the enemy. Savages with their savage ways. To accept their help was to admit defeat. But no matter how poorly we treated them, they didn't turn their backs on us. They stayed and listened. That's just the kind of people they are. Makes sense they'd get along with someone like you, who tries to push others away.

**JULLUS:** Get along? I'm upholding my part of the bargain. There's nothing more to it than that.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** If you say so... Ah, I'd nearly forgotten why I came. Are you hungry? We all get rations, and considering the work you're doing, you're as good as one of us.

**JULLUS:** I am running low on aether... Very well.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Azim Steppe-style dumplings. Buuz, they call them. Never had a dumpling? It's like...a kind of bread stuffed with a filling─meat or vegetables usually─that you bake or steam. We have our own recipes in Garlemald, too. My mother liked to make them. My brother and sister always fought over the jam-filled ones... J-Just think of it as bread, all right? I should warn you, though, they're spicy─helps them keep longer, I assume. Too much for the children to handle, though.

**JULLUS:** Interesting...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Interesting good or interesting...

**JULLUS:** I don't know much about taste. Not anymore. But I do feel a sensation in my mouth.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Is that a bad thing?

**JULLUS:** Not necessarily.

**ALISAIE:** Heh, that's enough for me. I've heard it said that spices are more akin to fire than flavors. Perhaps that makes them easier to understand.

**JULLUS:** Oh, Jullus. Getting acquainted with Zero, are we?

**ALISAIE:** Um...ah... I-I suppose I am...

**ALPHINAUD:** No harm in that. Acquaint away!

**GARLEANSOLDIER10320:** Ah, everyone is here. Excellent. Thank you all for your hard work. I've just finished up myself. Shall we go and find Estinien?

**JULLUS:** Alphinaud! Alisaie!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Report! Lost contact? When? Voidsent─I'd bet my life on it. Understood. I'll investigate at once. A unit transporting supplies has gone silent en route to Broken Glass. I will go and search for it. Stay here and keep watch, but be ready to answer my call.

**JULLUS:** If it was voidsent, you'd be a fool to go alone. They'll find you before you find your men. And then they'll devour you as well.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Perhaps you're right. Perhaps I don't stand a chance. But I can't just abandon them!

**JULLUS:** I can't repay you for the bread if you're dead. I'll go.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What!? No! I couldn't possibly ask you to do that!

**JULLUS:** I'm far better suited to dealing with voidsent. It makes sense. Or do you mean to say you'd rather I stay here because you can't protect this place on your own?

**GARLEANSOLDIER10410:**  Report if displayed.  Report if displayed. Fine. Just...don't do anything stupid. Promise me!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Grrr... Damn these demons!

**GARLEANSOLDIER10410:** Return to the camp. Now.

**VOIDSENT10410:** Y-Yes, ma'am! Thank you!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Kindred... Why do you interfere? Ah, of course. You sold your soul to feed.  Report if displayed.

**MEMORIAMASTERA10430:** I have taken bread. But my soul is forever mine. How... How big must the gate be for their like to come through... Is this it, then...? Just like that time... When Light still shone upon the world... When the Contramemoria still raged...

**MEMORIAMASTERB10430:** Stand aside if you value your life.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We're only after women and wine. Darkness can take the rest.

**MEMORIAMASTERA10430:** You're not taking another step towards that village.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Stupid girl. You were warned.  Report if displayed.

**MEMORIAMASTERB10430:**  Report if displayed.  Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Gotcha!

**MEMORIAMASTERB10430:**  Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** And now we can get back to our business.

**ALISAIE:**  Report if displayed. Get up... Get up, damn you! Too weak. I need...help... Someone...please... The same mistakes, the same ends. Again and again. What should I...what could I have done? What...? Who? You... What are you doing here...?

**ALPHINAUD:** Y'shtola and Estinien had matters well in hand. So we went where we were needed.

**000:** Can you stand?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? You're not finished yet, Zero. Let's fight together. We're a little late, but we've come to help you.

**ALPHINAUD:** ...All right. I will let it burn, this fire in my breast. Let it burn and rage and guide. You did well to find me out here.

**000:** We have Jullus to thank for that. He was quite worried when he called.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? There would've been more casualties if not for you. The people of Garlemald thank you.

**ALISAIE:** No, if it was not for you and the others, I...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Well, let's not fuss over details. We should return to Tertium─can you make it that far?

**JULLUS:** I think so.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero! Are you all right?

**JULLUS:** Well enough. No voidsent struck here, did they?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** No, and there weren't any more casualties thanks to you.

**JULLUS:**  Report if displayed. What are you doing?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You'll have no debts to repay, if that's what you're worried about. If anything, I owe you a week's worth of buuz.

**WATERMONOLITH:** Hmph.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Hah hah hah! All shall cower before the might of Archfiend Cagnazzo!

**WATERMONOLITH:** Tell me one thing, Cagnazzo. A dragon of our world crossed over into yours long ago, but I have felt her presence here again. What is the meaning of this?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** I daresay what you felt...was this.

**WATERMONOLITH:** By the Sisters... You... What have you done to Azdaja!?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** If you want answers, you'll have to get them from Lord Golbez. Assuming you've the strength to face him. A pity I will not see the plan to fruition, but my part is done. And to fade with the thrill of battle in my heart makes it all the more worthwhile...

**WATERMONOLITH:** No, wait! Where is she!? Where is my sister!?

**YSHTOLA:** At long last, I go to join the great flow...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** By the gate's closing, there can be no doubt that he was the one who opened it.

**ESTINIEN:** Oh, Azdaja... I prayed we might meet once more...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** She is likely still in the void. Take heart─we will find her yet.

**ALPHINAUD:** So, what now?

**ALISAIE:** While you discuss how to proceed with your search, I would excuse myself to look around. There may be salvage that we could use at the camp.

**YSHTOLA:** In that case, I'll patrol the area for more voidsent.

**ALISAIE:** Very well, let us take a moment to consider our options.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Is Vrtra not back yet?

**ESTINIEN:** My apologies for the delay.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Are you all right?

**ESTINIEN:** I am. As distressing as this turn of events was, the eye itself gives me cause to hope. While it is no longer possessed of Azdaja's will, it may yet lead us to her. Were it not for your encouragement, I would never have dared to embark on my search, much less come this far. I will not lose faith. I will find my sister, wheresoever she may be.

**YSHTOLA:** We'll return the eye to her together.

**ALISAIE:** Though tainted, the eye has not fully succumbed to Darkness. Azdaja herself may have been able to resist its influence.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, as much as we'd love to take part in your next foray, we can't abandon our efforts here.

**ESTINIEN:** Indeed. We'll need to keep a close watch in case the voidgate opens again as well. Though should it prove safe to do so, I have some ideas for how we might put this village to use.

**YSHTOLA:** Do what you must. We will manage.

**ALPHINAUD:** To free Azdaja, I expect we will have to deal with Golbez once and for all─after which you may undertake your work without worry.

**ALISAIE:** We look forward to the glad tidings.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You'll take good care of everyone, won't you?

**ALISAIE:** What? Why do you ask me this?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Because comrades look out for one another, and I can't think of anyone more qualified to keep them safe.

**ALPHINAUD:** True. I will do no less than I've promised.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** If our respective plans are settled, then let us head back.

**YSHTOLA:** If everyone is ready, then let us depart for Alzadaal's Legacy. What was that!?

**ESTINIEN:** A deluge of aether. The mark of a terrible magick.

**PANICFISHERMAN10720:** It wasn't far from here. Let's go!

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Hey, you! Stop! If you're thinking of taking to sea─don't!

**PANICFISHERMAN10720:** What has happened?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** We were out working our nets when a light suddenly shot up over Bhaflau Isle with a boom! A massive fiend then took to the skies. Another blasphemy, we feared─but we didn't linger to find out.

**PANICFISHERMAN10720:** Did you see where it was headed?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Can't say for sure, but it looked like it was northward bound.

**YSHTOLA:** I see... Our thanks for the warning, and do not let us keep you. Bhaflau Isle is connected to Alzadaal's Legacy. This cannot be a coincidence.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** In response to Cagnazzo's defeat, they have come for our gate...

**ESTINIEN:** So it seems. I would ascertain the situation at the vault, but the fiend must be dealt with ere people come to harm. I shall assume my dragon form and seek it out at once.

**000:** Wait. You heard the fisherman. A blasphemy, they called it. If another flying creature were sighted now, others will assume the worst, and panic will spread. This is not the way.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** What will you say? I'll see to the fiend. We can work together on this.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** ...You are right, Estinien. I will gather my soldiers and search the isle for casualties. As you wish, the fiend is yours. The fiend, I leave to you. The hunt will go more swiftly with help. Zero, might I prevail upon you to accompany her?

**YSHTOLA:** ...Very well.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Then Estinien and I will make for Alzadaal's Legacy and secure the gate.

**YSHTOLA:** Stay on your guard. The enemy is clever and will have anticipated our response. Be safe, my friends, and may the Sisters guide your steps.

**FIREMONOLITH:** (-Y'shtola-)Hello? Can you hear me? (-Y'shtola-)We were too late. The vault has been destroyed, the alchemical furnace with it. (-Y'shtola-)This was their true objective─to deny us entry into the void. (-Y'shtola-)Cagnazzo and Azdaja's eye were a diversion. (-Y'shtola-)A means to detain us in Garlemald while they went to work here. (-Y'shtola-)To reduce the vault to rubble... That which you hunt is no ordinary foe. Have care.

**000:** (-???-)Such an exquisite sight... A canvas of vibrant colors. As was our world too, once...

**FIREMONOLITH:** What will you say? One of Golbez's champions, I presume. Are you the one who destroyed the treasure vault?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** I am. Rubicante, the archfiend of fire. A monster in flesh, yet in spirit I remain a man. A prisoner of the past. Such tears I wept when Darkness consumed the world. Until Lord Golbez came and spoke of salvation. Thus do I walk proudly at his side, to see his dream fulfilled. Your heart is pure. For benevolent cause you seek the dragon. But I cannot allow you to have it─cannot allow you to interfere. If you would continue, then there is but one recourse. I shall await you at the summit. Come, mortal! Come and weigh your righteousness against mine! You stayed the course─as I knew you would. As too will I. Come!

**FIREMONOLITH:** It seems I was a step too slow.

**000:**   To defeat all of us archfiends... You are strong indeed.

**FIREMONOLITH:** What will you say? What is it that Golbez seeks? Why do you fight? What is it that you wish to save?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** You would know my lord's true purpose? Very well. The knowledge will not change the outcome. Listen, then, and learn how all began... You would know your enemy's heart? Very well. It bleeds more than you can ever understand, but I will speak, and you will listen, and learn how all began...

**FIREMONOLITH:** How long has it been since the world was undone... Since Light and life gave way to Darkness and undeath. Since we were reduced to beasts befouled, squabbling over what scant aether remains... But you are different. You remember who you were, and the paradise for which you fought. That world will never be ours again. But we need not suffer in this purgatory of death and rebirth forever. Join me, and together we shall seek the promised land!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** There is no hope─no freedom from the wheel. You speak a fantasy.

**WATERMONOLITH:** I speak truth. The Ascians' revelation. There are other worlds than this. Ours is but one of fourteen. There is no greater proof than the whispers we hear─born of a neighboring reality. A reality to which we may journey if we can but break down the barrier that divides us.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** You meant it, then? We will take this world as our own? Gahahaha! Count me in!

**FIREMONOLITH:** In return for your strength, I offer you opportunity to pursue your own ends in service to a greater cause... A glorious kingdom of Light, wherein all may know death's sweet embrace!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** ...And thus did we begin our great work.

**FIREMONOLITH:** You intend to forsake the Thirteenth and conquer the Source?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Just so. Our home is a lost cause, our only choice to begin anew. In this world, where we may reclaim our mortality.

**FIREMONOLITH:** You served Golbez of your own volition...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** As atonement for my failures. I tried to be a hero. Tried to stop the war...but I could not.

**FIREMONOLITH:** So in turn you wage another?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** A means to a final end. The wheel of depravity must be broken. Even the most exalted succumb. We eat and eat and deepen the stain upon our souls, until only the hunger remains. Is this to be our fate for all eternity?

**FIREMONOLITH:** ...I don't know. About this and a great many things. But I do know that it's wrong to damn another to save yourself. Not everything need be a trade. This I learned from the people of this world. Even without a contract, without any expectation of personal gain, they labor for one another. I didn't understand it at first─and perhaps I still don't. But if I'm to achieve something, I'd rather do it their way. Else I am already a hunger-maddened beast.

**000:**  Report if displayed. Perhaps we have indeed surrendered to the hunger after a fashion. Make for our moon. There you will find both Lord Golbez and your dragon.

**FIREMONOLITH:** What will you say? Why are you telling us this? Are you betraying Golbez?

**YSHTOLA:** To be so viciously slandered... Pride demands I prove my virtue at the last. Never. Our triumph is at hand, and the knowledge will avail you naught. But to be so viciously slandered... Pride demands I prove my virtue at the last. And perhaps your own will resonate with his...and draw forth that singular jewel which abides deep within his heart. A desire which lies beyond his quest to free us from our purgatory. A desire...all his own...

**ESTINIEN:** Thank goodness you're both all right. Unfortunately, we have nothing further to report apart from the loss of the gate. But tell us─how did you fare on the mountain? Golbez aspires to deliver voidsent unto the Source... Where they may die and return to the Lifestream to be reborn.

**YSHTOLA:** Far be it from me to deny them, but the cost to our people would be beyond unconscionable.

**000:** Indeed. Voidsent themselves are inherently dangerous, never mind the chaos sure to follow should the barrier 'twixt our worlds be shattered. 'Twould be naught less than a calamity.

**YSHTOLA:** What will you say? We can't let that happen. How can we prevent this?

**VRITRA:** Certainly not. That said, our task has been rendered rather difficult. The simplest way would, of course, be to strike at Golbez himself. That said, our task has been rendered rather difficult.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed... Rubicante hath deprived us of a means to cross into the void.

**ESTINIEN:** Cagnazzo's feint. That was doubtless what he meant when he said his part was done.

**VRITRA:** Golbez sacrificed two archfiends just to stop us. He must need more time to break the barrier to our world.

**YSHTOLA:** Then the days ahead will be critical. We must find a way back to the Thirteenth.

**VRITRA:** We could employ another Atomos, but that approach would only be viable if we found another planar fissure. An unlikely prospect. Better we explore other avenues. If you will excuse my absence, I shall return to Sharlayan to look for information.

**YSHTOLA:** By all means. Meanwhile, I shall seek the counsel of our alchemists.

**ESTINIEN:** Time is of the essence, so─wish me luck.

**000:** I'm no scholar. I'll find another way to keep myself busy here.

**ESTINIEN:** What will you say? Y'shtola alone will be more a match for those tomes. How about a little training to keep your lance arm honed?

**VRITRA:** Hmph. I don't doubt it. She's a veritable “Researcher of Light.” Heh, rest assured I never shirk my training. I will be ready for whatever awaits.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero. May we call upon thee when next we venture unto the Thirteenth?

**ESTINIEN:** Aye. And in case you're wondering, I won't ask for further payment. I will go for myself. To try and understand why I spoke the words I said to Rubicante... And the fire I felt within when you all came to my aid in Garlemald.

**VRITRA:** While our esteemed sorceress battles her tomes, let us see to our own affairs.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** I will not fail you again, Sister...



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MENPHINA:** At last, the time is come!



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**MEHRYDE:** My usual, please. But with this spice.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Of course, Zero. It would be my pleasure. Well now, this is enough to make a whole kettle of your special curry!

**MEHRYDE:** I don't need that much...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Rest assured, it's easy enough to make a serving just for you. Or we could make the kettle and share it? There would be enough not only for your companions, but other diners as well. I daresay everyone will be delighted.

**MEHRYDE:** Very well. A full kettle, then.

**VARSHAHN:** Excellent. We'll prepare it at once. And for Your Excellency and our esteemed adventurer? Are you happy to try a bowl of Zero's curry? We can make yours milder, if you prefer...

**000:** Grateful though I am for the offer, I cannot fully appreciate the flavor with this vessel. Another time, perhaps. Do not hold back on my account, my friend. Eat and enjoy.

**MEHRYDE:** What will you say? Then I'll have His Excellency's helping! If I could have mine a touch milder...

**VARSHAHN:** Understood. Please, make yourselves comfortable.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** It gladdens me to see you taking to life in Radz-at-Han, Zero. In the area of our cuisine not least of all. Spicy dishes have long been favored in our sultry clime for their ability to whet the appetite and cool the body. Of course, spices also have the effect of preserving foods, which makes them highly coveted in foreign lands. All of this has given rise to a thriving spice industry, and the wealth it brings has allowed our nation to prosper while maintaining its neutrality.

**VARSHAHN:** So you trade your spices. Seems rather more complicated than trading in aether.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:**   In the beginning, this land was no more than refuge for me. But now it is my home, and the people of Radz-at-Han my beloved children. Together we built this vibrant nation. And naught would please me more than to show it to my sister one day.

**FIREMONOLITH:** Vibrant... Rubicante said the same when he described this world. A reminder of all that has been stolen from us... What many who remember doubtless yearn to take back.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Our home is a lost cause, our only choice to begin anew. In this world, where we may reclaim our mortality.

**VARSHAHN:** Nonetheless, it's wrong to damn another to save yourself─as I told Rubicante. As I found myself moved to speak... I still do not understand what made me feel this way. Nor what compels you mortals to help one another. But I hope to someday.

**HANNISHMAN04735A:** We, too, hope that you will find the answers you seek.

**HANNISHMAN04735B:** What is going on?

**MEHRYDE:** What? What's happening?

**HANNISHMAN04735B:** Compliments of Mistress Zero, the satrap's honored guest, we are serving a special curry for anyone who wishes to partake. But be warned: it is not for the faint of heart!

**HANNISHMAN04735A:** Oh! By all means, I'd welcome the challenge!

**HANNISHMAN04735B:** Sisters have mercy...the smell alone is...

**VARSHAHN:** It burns! It burns!

**MEHRYDE:** To better maintain the facade, the alchemists ensured that my vessel was capable of consuming food... However, I fear Zero's curry would test the limits of their design.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Apologies for the delay. Please relax and enjoy your meal.

**000:** “Relax”? I don't have time for that. I've been waiting for this... Come, let's replenish our aether.

**VARSHAHN:** What will you say? My whole life flashed before my eyes─and it was exhilarating! I thought the spices we picked were perfect.

**ESTINIEN:** I trust you have eaten your fill. I shall have Mehryde prepare a meal for us to take to Estinien. I suspect he too is overdue a “replenishment.” By this hour, he will have retired to his chambers at Meghaduta. Come, let us pay him a visit. Estinien, are you there? We've brought something for you.

**VARSHAHN:** Aye... Enter...        

**ESTINIEN:** Squid masala from the meyhane. I thought you might enjoy it.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Masala, eh? I prefer my squid dried, but I'm sure it won't disappoint. My thanks. Idle as I am in our sorceress's absence, I see. I can't offer much in the way of entertainment, but make yourselves comfortable.

**VARSHAHN:** Shall we disrobe as well?

**YSHTOLA:** No, no. We simply caught our friend unprepared. He will make himself presentable at once, I am sure.

**VARSHAHN:** At last. We've been looking for you.

**YSHTOLA:** My friends! Tell me─were you able to devise a way to return to the Thirteenth?

**URIANGER:** I believe so. It required a visit to the moon, where I took the opportunity to enlist Urianger's assistance.

**YSHTOLA:** Y'shtola hath told me all. I should be glad to help you free Azdaja and put an end to Golbez's dark plot.

**VARSHAHN:** If Rubicante spoke true, both Golbez and Azdaja are on the moon of the Thirteenth. Unlike here in the Source, however, we have no means of making the journey from the surface of the star itself. The technology simply does not exist. Therefore, I propose that we employ a gate to deliver us directly to our destination.

**YSHTOLA:** Is such a feat possible?

**URIANGER:** In theory. Having once been a single whole, the Source and its reflections share striking similarities in geography. And according to a certain someone who unceremoniously whisked us away to the First, the same locations across the worlds are intrinsically bound. All of which is to say, were we to pass through a gate on the Source's moon, it should lead us to the moon of the Thirteenth. Of course, there is the risk of voidsent gaining entry to our world. Thus did I decide to seek Urianger's counsel.

**ESTINIEN:** Both the watcher and the Loporrits are aware of our proposed endeavor. While they are yet deliberating precautionary measures, they have pledged their full cooperation.

**YSHTOLA:** You've been busy. I presume you've also found a way to open this gate?

**VARSHAHN:** Be it in Radz-at-Han or Sharlayan, scholars have long cast their gaze unto the endless dark of the void. And so, with Hannish insights to augment our knowledge, we have indeed conceived of a promising plan to pierce the veil. A plan I am confident will succeed precisely because the moon is our stage. The preparations will be extensive, and we will require vast quantities of aether. After all, our gate must be large enough to accommodate another great wyrm. My proposal entails delivering copious amounts of aether to the Tower of Babil in Garlemald. As you will recall, Fandaniel used the structure to destroy the brands imprisoning Zodiark. And we, in like manner, will use it to channel aether to the moon─and thereby open our gate.

**YSHTOLA:** I see... Then we shall need someone on the moon for the necessary rituals.

**ESTINIEN:** Just so, Your Excellency. I intend to head back anon for that very purpose, as well as to help devise our strategy to deal with invading voidsent. Along with our lunar allies, we will once again require the assistance of your alchemists, Nidhana not least of all. May I trouble you to serve as their escort?

**URIANGER:** Fine by me. The room was beginning to feel constraining.

**YSHTOLA:** For my part, I shall oversee the requisite tasks on the star. Might I prevail upon you for your assistance?

**KRILE:** If all are in agreement, then let us set to work. We'll open our gate. And we will stop Golbez.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Well, now, if it isn't two of my dearest friends. As for the other two... I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Not in this vessel, perhaps. 'Tis I, Varshahn...though you are welcome to call me Vrtra, if you prefer.

**URIANGER:** Pay me no mind. I merely accompany them.

**KRILE:** I pray you forgive us our intrusion. If you are occupied, we shall call again anon.

**ERENVILLE:** It's quite all right. We've just finished swapping all our secrets anyway. Erenville occasionally comes and shares the latest gleaner gossip, you see. From forgotten ruins to mysterious relics, if there's aught that might be of interest to the Students, he kindly lets us know.

**URIANGER:** Alas, I must soon depart on an expedition. As I may be away for an extended period, I wished to give Krile fair warning. Hence my visit today.

**ERENVILLE:** I see. There are specimens that want for procuring, I presume?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** No, no, it isn't guildship business, but rather... A homecoming. But enough about me. You have business too, yes? And I am in the way.

**KRILE:** Far from it. As a matter of fact, we should be grateful if you could stay and share your knowledge of the nearby isles with us. We seek a means to travel to the void. There, a man named Golbez plots to invade our world. A man who even now holds my sister hostage... ...To that end, we require a great quantity of aether, which we understand may be had on the Isle of Haam. We came in the hope of exploring how it might best be procured.

**ERENVILLE:** An invasion from the Thirteenth? Must the stakes always be so dramatic...

**KRILE:** You have a knack for finding trouble. If gleaners collected world-ending crises, you could make quite a name for yourself in our profession. It's true the Isle of Haam is a veritable font of aether. But as it's under the Forum's direct jurisdiction, only a privileged few get to set foot there. I myself haven't.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** So if we want to help ourselves to the isle's aether, we'll need to secure the Forum's permission. Very well. The Students of Baldesion recognize your endeavors as combating a grave threat to the world. As representative, I hereby pledge our full assistance. Now that it's official, you may leave the politics and paperwork to me. Our operations remain small, but we shouldn't meet any undue resistance.

**URIANGER:** We are truly grateful!

**ERENVILLE:** If I may. According to the original plan for the exodus, aether collected from the Isle of Haam was to power the ark. Art thou perchance familiar with the logistics of this endeavor?

**URIANGER:** I don't know anything about that, I'm afraid, nor do I think any gleaner would. You might have better luck asking someone involved with the ark's construction. Margrat, for instance. She's a researcher in Sharlayan Hamlet. I met with her for a job recently, and she mentioned working on the *Ragnarok*'s propulsion system. You could do worse than to seek her out while awaiting the Forum's verdict.

**ERENVILLE:** We may well do just that. Our gratitude for thine advice, and may this threat be but a memory upon thy return.

**KRILE:** You're quite welcome. Now then, if you'll excuse me.

**URIANGER:** I'd best start drafting our petition! Go on and find your researcher─I'll contact you as soon as we've made progress.

**KRILE:** Let us leave matters here to Mistress Krile, and hie ourselves to Labyrinthos.

**HAAMBORTMAN:** Right, then. Time to put our best foot forward.   A pity you can't tidy yourself. I should've had Y'shtola enchant you when I had the chance. And what have we here? Later, Krile. Later. You've work to do!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Bound for the Isle of Haam? You look like the ones Master Fourchenault told me to expect. If you're ready to depart, then so am I. Just say the word.

**URIANGER:** Is something the matter?

**THANCRED:** I did recruit one other to our party, but he is late to arrive...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Forgive me my delay.

**THANCRED:** Thancred! 'Tis good to see you.

**URIANGER:** If it isn't Varshahn. They do grow up so quickly. Urianger tells me we have a host of exciting new tribulations to face. And you must be Zero. I've heard all about your derring-do in Garlemald. A pleasure.

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** Apart from strengthening our company with his redoubtable skill at arms, Thancred may also serve as a mentor in those matters that trouble thee. I speak of the intangible forces which bring souls together. Thancred is possessed of experience both unique and insightful that I am sure he would gladly share with thee. Thou needst but ask.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Much obliged for clearin' the way! We'll get to work at once! Fillin' these up will take a good while. I'd appreciate it if you stood watch till we've finished. I ain't gettin' chewed to chum by some aether-bloated bugger! Oh, by the by. Where were you plannin' on puttin' these to use? We could deliver 'em by airship, see─provided it ain't too far.

**KOKKOLDANKKOL:** We would need them transported to Garlemald─to the Tower of Babil.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Ahh, that's a long old journey... Too long for a direct flight. Tell you what: we'll send 'em over with the scheduled shipment of provisions headed that way. I'll make the arrangements as soon as we get back. Save some poor chocobos havin' to drag this lot through the snow.

**THANCRED:** You have our thanks. We shall not forget your generosity.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Everything seems to be proceeding apace. I daresay you would've been fine without me.

**THANCRED:** Why would you say such a thing? You are not bound by contract or the threat of force, and you gain no advantage by devaluing your own contribution. Yet you must be bound by something to speak thus. What is it?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What binds me... Hmm. A belief, I suppose. Born of our shared struggles. No matter where my comrades go, I have faith they will be fine. For I know that they will walk their chosen path as surely as I walk mine. I trust them, in short─trite though it may sound.

**THANCRED:** Trust... I remember the word. How long has it been since last I used it? It had no place in my dealings. Not with other voidsent, and certainly not with Zenos. Not even in the time before Darkness engulfed the world... Full often did memoriates betray their own, corrupted by the very power they wielded. You could trust no one but yourself. Alone we fought, and alone we fell. I wouldn't know how to trust. Is there some trick to it?

**URIANGER:**   Just stay close to this one. You'll learn in no time. Aye, absolutely fine.

**THANCRED:** I confess, I thought thou mightst have more words of counsel to offer.

**URIANGER:** Oh, she'll soon get the hang of it─even without my help. After our work here is done, I'll see myself back to the shadows. But before that... I take it you've heard as well?

**THANCRED:** Indeed. The client seeketh Archons, and 'twould seem our extensive travels and neutrality make us prime candidates.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Well, assuming we take on the request, I suspect I'll be stuck with you again. Don't let me down, hm?

**METTIUS:** Praise the Sisters you are safe!

**JULLUS:** Don't think I'm indebted to you. I never asked for your help.

**METTIUS:** You love Garlemald dearly, Lord Mettius. That much is plain. But you're not alone in that. We all mourn what has become of our homeland. Bristle at having to rely upon outsiders simply to survive the cold. Even now, I struggle with fear and uncertainty. Day after day, I ask myself, what is right? Where do we go from here? I've yet to find the answers. But I won't stop looking nonetheless. And I won't avert my gaze from our grim reality.

**JULLUS:** Is there hope for us?

**METTIUS:** Aye. So long as we live. Garlemald lies in ruins, but the bonds between us will never be broken. We are the chain that connects generations past and future. You and I its links. Help us, Lord Mettius, for all we have been and for what we may yet become. Please.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:**   To be lectured by the young... It ill becomes a man of my station. I will rejoin the talks at Tertium. Might I trouble you to escort me? Ere we part... I apologize for my...discourtesy. I owe you my life, and...I thank you.

**URIANGER:** Jullus, wait. I'd like a word. With you as well. I'm to stay close, after all.

**JULLUS:** Worry not, we shall see the magistrate safely back to Tertium.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What is it?

**JULLUS:** You bound that man with trust, didn't you? That's why he did not require coercion to return.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Er... Shall we walk, perhaps? Chilly standing around here. So that's how Zero came to join you. Still, I'm not sure I'm qualified to explain something like trust. I wouldn't describe myself as a sociable person. Before all...this...any free time I had, I spent looking after my brother and sister. As for the magistrate, I only told him what's been on my mind of late... But I wouldn't have done so, I think, if it weren't for the twins' influence. Trust is infectious, in a manner of speaking. When someone believes in you, it makes you want to believe in them. In others. In yourself. Perhaps it's because the magistrate felt that earnestness that he gave us a chance. As I did, after I was caught trying to steal provisions from “the enemy.” Trust comes easy in such company.

**JULLUS:** Little wonder my world is devoid of it. No one trusts in you, and so you trust in no one. And round the wheel turns. During the Contramemoria, we had already come to judge one another based on strength and usefulness. You either used or were used. Those who rejected this rule didn't survive. My mother wanted to save the world. To fulfill the hopes of memoriates good and true. After she died, I carried on her mission alone.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Alone... Didn't you have anyone to help you?

**JULLUS:** Almost. Two men tried, just the once. A swordsman and a mage, whom I met when passing through a village. They had saved the people there from corrupted memoriates. When they learned our enemies were the same, they seemed heartened. They claimed to be soldiers of a kingdom called Baron, and were traveling the realm in search of a means to end the Contramemoria. They invited me to join them. I refused. How could I not, having learned the lessons of my world? Those who would work with others always have their own motives. I would not place myself at their mercy. I would not be forced to submit. I expected some manner of outburst. Some show of frustration at having failed to deceive me. But they simply watched me walk away. I didn't know what to make of it then, but now... Perhaps they shared a bond of trust. Perhaps they were the last ones left who dared. Perhaps they hoped I was like them, too. Perhaps it was just an offer and nothing more. I continued fighting alone. But ultimately, I was undone. Overwhelmed by enemies that had banded together. I was cold. In pain. Wishing desperately that someone would save me. And as I lay there in solitude, I felt it happen. The breaking of our world. Darkness washed over me, and I was swept into the rift. When I finally managed to return, it was to a world forever transformed. My home, now filled with abominations. I had a chance to learn about trust...and forsook it. I never had the power to save my home single-handed. I should have accepted their invitation. Had I joined them, as I've joined you, I might not have had to face the end of the world alone. But it's all history, now. No amount of reflection or regret will change our present reality.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Whatever may have happened in the past, you're still here, Zero. Alive. So long as you're alive, there will always be hope. No matter how bad things get. What you couldn't do yesterday, you might still do today. Think about it. It's plain that you've forged bonds with those around you. If you didn't feel that in some sense, would you have risked your life as you did for a meager ration of buuz? I trust you too, for what it's worth.

**000:** Here it is again. The fire that burned in my breast when you came to my rescue. The urge to weep, though there is no sorrow... If this is trust, then what must I do? How do I answer it?

**JULLUS:** What will you say? However you like. With a handshake, perhaps?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Give me your hand. It's not something you do constantly, mind. A friend is a friend regardless.

**URIANGER:** A “friend”? ...So that's what it means. Someone you trust.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Let us take a moment to review matters as they stand. Having procured sufficient stores of aether, we may now channel the requisite energy unto the moon via the Tower of Babil. Our work on the star is complete. However, we have yet to receive word from Y'shtola as to the state of the lunar preparations.

**URIANGER:** A ritual to open the gate, and measures to forestall a voidsent invasion... Neither task is simple nor quickly completed. She would doubtless benefit from our assistance.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** The very thing I was about to propose. Let us join her above and lend what aid we may. Ere we set forth, however, Y'shtola did bid me relay a message to thee. As thou art well aware, a key objective of our mission is the extraction of thy sister Azdaja from the void. Held captive for millennia and divested of an eye, she is like to be severely weakened. To make good her escape, she shall require aid─aid that is best provided by a fellow great wyrm.

**URIANGER:** You would have me go in my true form? Very well. Like our sire, we great wyrms are capable of traversing the great expanse. The journey will take some time, but I shall take myself to the moon. To begin with, I shall return this vessel to Radz-at-Han, that I may have both my eyes. And until such time as we find Azdaja, I would entrust her eye to your keeping. Will you do this for me?

**ALISAIE:** We shall contact you via linkpearl once all is in place on the moon. You need but follow Y'shtola's instructions.

**JULLUS:** Understood. We'll be ready.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Take care, Zero.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** It will be the briefest of homecomings. I'll be back before you know it.

**URIANGER:** In Mare Lamentorum, then. Go well!

**YSHTOLA:** I took the liberty of informing Y'shtola of our arrival. She and her entourage should be here momentarily.

**URIANGER:** Forgive me, I'd hoped to have everything in order sooner. My thanks for the extra hands.

**YSHTOLA:** [AMUSED CHUCKLE] Alphinaud and Alisaie stand ready at the Tower of Babil. Vrtra is also en route.

**NIDHANA:** Excellent. You've done well, all of you. For my part, I've managed to prepare the ritual with help from the watcher. All that remains is to channel the aether from below. This should─I pray─open a gate leading to the moon of the Thirteenth.

**YSHTOLA:** May I just say how excited we are to be a part of this grand undertaking! The development of the artificial Atomos was one thing, but this is an opportunity like no other! Y'shtola even managed to get a loan of Allagan treatises on voidsent summoning from the prized collection of the Sons of Saint Coinach! The empire's application of aetherochemistry in regulating voidgates provided us with many a useful insight for our work, let me tell you!

**URIANGER:** I asked a favor of G'raha Tia when we were comparing notes on cross-rift travel. Given his credentials, I was confident he wouldn't be denied. The knowledge of our forebears has brought us far. As has our own. And with our knowledge and resources, we shall construct a voidsent containment seal on a heretofore unseen scale.

**YSHTOLA:** Containment seal... Then thou wouldst make use of...

**NIDHANA:** Aye. A tried and tested means of holding dark entities at bay is readily available here. 'Twould be remiss of us not to employ it. We shall reforge the brands that Zenos and Fandaniel destroyed. That which held even Zodiark shall more than suffice for voidsent of any persuasion.

**YSHTOLA:** The watcher is already hard at work tending to the most critical parts of the brands' restoration. There are, however, a number of concerning factors that remain. With your help, I'm sure we can resolve them!

**LIVINGWAY:** Time is of the essence, so I suggest we continue this discussion as we make our way to the brands.

**MAPPINGWAY:** Dreadfully sorry to have kept you all waiting!

**URIANGER:** Hello there, friends. And new person. Heard there was a bit of a rush, so we gathered what combat-ready supporters we had available.

**LIVINGWAY:** A welcome contribution. Thine initiative never ceaseth to amaze.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Oh, stop! You're making me blush! Even now as we pursue new dreams, aiding the people of Etheirys remains our greatest joy. Though we have fulfilled the purpose given to us by Hydaelyn, aiding the people of Etheirys remains our greatest joy. So you can count on us, ever and always! Right, so! We originally deployed these supporters to patrol the moon and keep it safe. They've never tussled with voidsent before, but with sufficient data, they ought to hold their own against the ghastly fiends. Practical, tactical data, acquired in the moment. And who better to give the supporters an educational thrashing than the champion of Etheirys?

**SLEEPINGWAY:** I believe I would make a better instructor. Not only have I fought voidsent─I am one.

**LIVINGWAY:** Well don't just stand there, engage! Engage, engage, engage!

**MAPPINGWAY:** That'll do! That'll do! A defeat bitterer than the bitterest carrot... Using this experience, we must enhance the supporters and turn them into voidsent slaughter-bots!

**URIANGER:** Indeed... Right after we've managed to put the poor dears back together.

**MAPPINGWAY:** Pray forgive our comrade's enthusiasm. May I inquire as to how long the repairs will take?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** On an ordinary day, I'd say no less than five carrots, briskly consumed. But if you were to provide us with encouragement... We just might be able to do it in two.

**YSHTOLA:** This, I leave to you.

**ALPHINAUD:** Can you hear me? We've just finished restoring the brands. Let us reconvene once you've finished tending to matters there. The culmination of our efforts is nigh! (-Y'shtola-)Apologies for the wait. The preparations here are finally complete.

**YSHTOLA:** Excellent. The tower too is activated. But give the word, and we will begin channeling the aether.

**ALISAIE:** (-Y'shtola-)Very well, then. Make it so.

**NIDHANA:** The moment of truth!

**YSHTOLA:** By the Sisters...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Urianger, commence your invocations. 'Tis time to open our gate! A tear is beginning to form! Quickly, activate the brands!   Success... The gate is open, and the seal appears to be in place...

**VOIDSENT04735:** Let's see how well it holds. 

**URIANGER:** What an enormous gate! Lord Golbez will be eager to hear of this! So this is the promised land... The land of boundless aether! Arrrgh! 

**VRITRA:** I daresay the seal doth serve its purpose.

**YSHTOLA:** I see all proceedeth apace. Remarkable...

**NIDHANA:** Indeed. Just this moment, a voidsent emerged from the gate─by which we may safely assume it leads to the Thirteenth.

**YSHTOLA:** It's incredible, Y'shtola! Truly incredible! Oh, what an honor it is to have been part of this historic achievement!

**URIANGER:** A part is an understatement. None of this would have been possible without you and yours. Our success has also served to solidify our understanding of cross-rift travel. The Ascians rejoined reflections to the Source by instigating elemental imbalances. These imbalances weakened the barrier between realities, causing the aether of a reflection to flood the Source. But why is it that reflections are predisposed to rejoin the Source? Why have they never merged with one another?

**YSHTOLA:** Thou art suggesting there is a unique property inherent to the Source─one responsible for such an outcome?

**ESTINIEN:** I am. 'Tis my conclusion that, as the point of origin for the reflections, the Source has an innate “pull” over them. Hydaelyn, I believe, sought to suppress that pull, which is why She was created with the power of Light─of stasis. Meanwhile, the power of Darkness─of activity─reigns in the void. Hydaelyn's influence would naturally be weaker, and this manifested in the form of planar fissures. Working with this hypothesis, I set my sights upon where the pull was assessed to be strongest. And through our combined efforts, we succeeded in opening a gate to the void. Now, I must stress: it was because we sought the void that we succeeded. Pleased though I am to have my theory proven, the secrets of travel to other reflections still elude us. Even so, in the reality that lies beyond the Eighth Umbral Calamity, there are those who found a way to reach the First. I will not rest until I do the same.

**YSHTOLA:** One step closer to fulfilling your dream, eh?

**VRITRA:** Just a step. Many more remain to be taken. Which further motivates me to forestall a voidsent invasion. So come, let us set forth─to find Azdaja, and put an end to Golbez's plot!

**URIANGER:** Climb upon my back. I shall take us to the gate.

**NIDHANA:** As we did discuss prior, I shall see the alchemists safely home, then together with the Loporrits, maintain vigil over the gate.

**VRITRA:** May the Sisters watch over and keep you safe!

**YSHTOLA:** Unto the void once more!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** This is the moon of the Thirteenth?

**ESTINIEN:** It is. Ever since the Flood, it has been a sanguinary orb in the sky.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** No voidsent. A rather more subdued reception than I had anticipated.

**VRITRA:** But unsurprising, given how jealously Golbez conceals the location of his domain. Still, we must remain on guard. One of his minions came through the gate, after all, and more may lie in wait.

**ESTINIEN:** I do not sense my sister... Where could she be? Where?

**VRITRA:** Steady, Vrtra. We've barely arrived. Let us explore our surrounds before drawing conclusions.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Yes... Thou art right. I shall survey the moon from above. The ground, I leave to you all.

**YSHTOLA:** The chasm has caught your attention as well. There's some manner of structure below. Worth a look, wouldn't you say?

**VRITRA:** I too sense something here. This pit much resembles the Cradle of Darkness on our moon, where Zodiark was once imprisoned. If this place serves the same function, then a fragment of His power must have been sealed in the depths. Strange, though. When Zodiark perished in the Source, I presumed that every aspect of Him was thus unmade, and His power scattered. But it's unmistakable, the Darkness that permeates this abyss. Could a trace of Him yet remain...or is it something else?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:**   I hear thee, Sister! I hear thee! Climb on, my friends! Azdaja is here, within this chasm! Sister! 'Tis I, Vrtra! I have come to rescue thee!

**AZDAJA:** You were entrusted with Azdaja's eye, were you not?

**VRITRA:** What? How... Vrtra...? Wherefore art thou here...?

**AZDAJA:** Oh, thank goodness! 'Tis thee, dear sister. Truly thee... How long have I dreamed of this moment! Would that I could have found thee sooner...but I am here now. Let us return home, together.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The thought filleth me with joy...but I fear it cannot be. Not even with a dragon's might can these chains be broken. For they are forged of the very will of the man named Golbez.

**AZDAJA:** So this is indeed Golbez's domain.

**VRITRA:** Thou keepest company with mortals?

**AZDAJA:** I do. They are my stalwart allies, without whom I could not have come this far.

**VRITRA:** Is that so... Then much time hath passed indeed. It doth feel like only yesterday that we were fighting the voidsent hordes the men of Allag had unleashed on Meracydia... Desperate to save Tiamat, I flew into this lightless world to strike at the heart of the Cloud of Darkness's forces. But the voidsent I slew returned again and again. And before I knew it, the rift betwixt worlds had closed. I was stranded. Bereft of strength...

**AZDAJA:** Thou didst save the lives of full many, Sister. Today, we abide in harmony with men, working side by side and forging enduring bonds. Indeed, in the course of searching for thee, I did cross paths with many a noble mortal, with whom I built a nation of rich diversity. To thee I would show it─my beautiful Radz-at-Han. I shall not rest until thou art free.

**ESTINIEN:** When Golbez found me collapsed, the Darkness ravaging my wounds, he spoke and said: “'Tis but a matter of time before you turn. But I have the power to stop it.” And he did─for a price. I would remain myself, but bound. An everlasting feast for his minions, who supped upon my aether over thousands of years.

**AZDAJA:** What now, then? Does this great wyrm intend to remain a captive meal for all eternity, not daring to test her chains?

**ESTINIEN:** If such is thine attempt at encouragement, mortal, then thou art as graceless as Nidhogg. 'Twas Golbez who did weave this spell, and so his defeat should serve to unravel it. Would it suffice as a show of spirit were I to reveal what I know of the villain?

**AZDAJA:** Now there's a start. So, what can you tell us?

**ESTINIEN:** Mayhap in order to sustain the magick, he cannot travel far from this place. He doth prefer to send minions to carry out his will, but on occasion will himself ascend to the moon's surface. And every time, without fail, he will visit the same location to the south. Something of import lieth there, doubt not.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Well, you heard her. Shall we look into this spot near and dear to our enemy's heart?

**DURANTE:** Did you find something? A memoria. But whose...?

**MEMORIAMASTERA04661:** You have lied, pillaged, and murdered. Have you anything to say in your defense?

**BARONKNIGHT:**   No. Every one of them got what they deserved. Trusting fools. Like you would-be heroes. Aye, you'd do well to keep a close eye on each other. It always ends the same way. A knife in the back. And better to have the handle towards your hand. You'll see... Oh yes, you will...

**DURANTE:** ...In death, may your soul find salvation.

**BARONKNIGHT:** I can't bring myself to pray for the unrepentant. You're a nobler man than I. 

**DURANTE:** Come now. We are all shaped by these dark times more than we would care to admit. I choose to believe that, had these men known peace and plenty, they would not have been consumed by mistrust and avarice.

**VOIDPERSON04735:** Victims of the Contramemoria then, like so many others. But we will end it.

**BARONKNIGHT:** Thank you. I shudder to imagine what might have happened if you hadn't dealt with the dark ones.

**VOIDPERSON04735:** ...Who is that?

**DURANTE:** Oh, her. She's like you, I hear. Hunts memoriates taken by Darkness.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Well, well, a kindred spirit. Perhaps we will finally have a new comrade.

**BARONKNIGHT:** No. I've no interest in working with others, much less someone who looks as suspicious as you.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Is that so...

**DURANTE:** ...If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way.

**BARONKNIGHT:** Even when we share the same goal, we can't overcome the mistrust. Such is the way of things─the “wisdom” of our era...

**DURANTE:** Only a precious few memoriates remain who cling to the Light. Would that we could have won her over...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We'll make do, old friend. We have accomplished much already, and another person may well have been more of a hindrance than help. Now then, our work here is finished. His Majesty has summoned us, so let us not delay. To Baron!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Had another vision of the past, did you? ...What? I was in it!? It's them─the pair I met in that village. Which means the one sealed in this memoria is...

**VRITRA:** So, you have come. You who would oppose our crusade...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Sister!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** You... I know you.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Is that so? From the world before, I daresay. 'Tis impressive enough that you have managed to retain your mortal form, but to remember your past besides... But that is of no moment. You are the memoriate who vanquished my minions, correct?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** And what if I am?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Then I would bid you join me. As a child of our world and slave to the wheel, fight with me for the salvation of all our souls.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Fight with you? More like fight as your pawn. It isn't me you want, but my power. And if I don't obey, you'll bind me like you bound that dragon. But no more. I refuse to be bound ever again. I fight only for myself, and for those in whom I trust. My friends.

**VRITRA:** I see. A pity. It is for the dragon that you have come, yes? When first you appeared, I thought simply to remove a threat to our plan. Never did I imagine that you would reach this place, and gift me a golden opportunity!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Speak plainly, gaoler.

**VRITRA:**   Long as it has been imprisoned, this dragon has grown feeble and weak, its spirit extinguished. Your coming has served to rekindle her forgotten hope. Her yearning to be free─to return home! That is the key to our deliverance!

**YSHTOLA:** Azdaja! No!

**AZDAJA:** The Darkness is ravaging her! She's becoming a voidsent!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Vrtra... Thou must flee!

**VRITRA:** Rise, O Shadow Dragon, and obey! Kill him.

**ESTINIEN:** Sister, please!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Damn you!

**VRITRA:** Keep our guests occupied.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Save her, I beg thee... Save my sister...

**000:** Before Darkness swallowed the world, I fought tirelessly in a war without end. The experience taught me to discern the strong. That dragon...and you. Come. Face me.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** What will you say? Rest assured I need no invitation. I'll deal with you, and then I'll free Azdaja.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Accursed Light... You who have ever basked in its warmth could never understand our envy! Our agony! You will not deny us our release! Expect no mercy. To destroy you, I shall bring my all to bear! Come, warriors from beyond the rift! My power... Even my blade... So this is the limit of my defiance...

**ESTINIEN:** Are you all right!?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** What's happening!?

**VRITRA:** Hahaha... Ahahahahaha! At last, the moment is at hand... You may have bested me, but not quickly enough. Too late will you look to the chasm. You've won the battle, but I win the war!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Stop this, I beg of thee! Let her go!

**VRITRA:** Darkness made manifest once abided in the depths of this abyss. Until, one day, it dispersed in a haze of aether. In the absence of the great flow, that aether has nowhere to return. And so it has coalesced, giving rise to a mighty voidsent! Now, feast! Feast upon this dragon, and its ardent longing for home with it!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Nooooooooo!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** From the convergence of ancient and newborn, an entity without equal shall emerge─one who shall tear down the barrier between worlds! Upon you, who shall deliver us from eternal damnation, I bestow the name of a hero of eld! Zeromus! Awaken!

**YSHTOLA:** No matter how powerful, a voidsent can be sealed in memoria!   Damn it... It's too strong...

**VRITRA:** Our warding scales may not hold! Not against a voidsent born of Zodiark's aether!

**BLACKKNIGHT:**   We must retreat! Everyone, to me! I will return, Sister, and I will save thee. This I swear!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:**    

**VRITRA:** Do you remember Ciriatto and Farfarello? The cowardly pair of voidsent that dwelled in my domain. Ciriatto devoured Farfarello. And in so doing, he inherited an all-consuming fear of Barbariccia. For as you know, when a voidsent is devoured, it doesn't simply cease to be. Its soul persists within the devourer. And when a voidsent dies, all the souls that harbored may break free to become individual entities once more. That is to say, by defeating Zeromus, we may yet save Azdaja. And to make certain that we do, we must remind her of who she is. When the time comes, you must call to her. Call with all your being.

**YSHTOLA:** Thy words give me heart, Zero. Thou hast my gratitude.

**ESTINIEN:** Then it's settled. Our objective is to defeat Zeromus. While it is unsettling that a voidsent could be born of Zodiark's aether, its very nature may render it susceptible to the brands that once contained Him. Did Urianger have aught to say? I see... If the seal may not hold for long, then haste is paramount.

**YSHTOLA:** Couldn't we just let it come to the Source and strike it down here?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Doing so would consign Azdaja's soul to the aetherial sea. Any attempt to ensure her survival demands that we deal with Zeromus in the Thirteenth.

**YSHTOLA:** I could barely go near it, never mind land a blow, so thick was the shroud of Darkness. How do you propose we fight such a foe?

**ESTINIEN:** Simple. Against impenetrable Darkness, we must wield resplendent Light. And it just so happens there is a world replete with Light. The question of how we will harness that Light you may leave to me. With our recent discoveries and proven techniques, as well as the aid of comrades near and far, I have faith that we will find a way. But only if I begin my work at once. Rest up while you can, for there will be much to do when I return.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** It wouldn't do to be idle while our esteemed sorceress labors tirelessly. I shall be training if you have need of me.

**ESTINIEN:** Wait. Allow me to join you. I must become stronger for what lies ahead.

**VRITRA:**   Fine by me. Come on, then.

**SYSTEM:** I shall not pass my time wallowing in despair. Using my vessel, I shall attend what preparations I may.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Meanwhile, on the moon of the Thirteenth...

**SYSTEM:** Zeromus is risen, but not yet at full strength. It will take time before the fiend is able to breach the veil. But what is another moment on this long journey I have endured. It remains as fresh as if it were yesterday, old friend. The memory of your passing...and the pain. As I promised you then, I promise you now: they shall sing of Golbez─the hero who shattered the wheel and brought salvation to the world.



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**PANDAEMONIUM:** My feast...must not end... My feast...must not be interrupted! My feast...must not end... My feast...must not be interrupted!

**THEMIS:** I am...Pandæmonium. From countless failures have I wrought miracles. Into soulless vessels, I breathe life!

**ATHENA:** I suppose I have Athena to thank for this incarnation. I have long considered how I might stand against you, I admit. In transformation I present to you my truth. I am Elidibus!

**THEMIS:** You have done well to reach the seat of godhood. Now, bare your souls to me!

**ELIDIBUS:** ...I see. Then Hephaistos's story has been laid bare. As has the nature of our mysterious crystal. The questions which led us into Pandæmonium are answered, and soon order shall be restored. I, too, can fade away, unburdened by regret. I could not have reached this point without you, friend.   So many revelations, but there are more, if you would dig a little deeper. Elidibus's soul was plucked from the aetherial sea, and from it I was wrought. Surely you have a passing interest in what I remember. In what I feel... You deserve what answers I can provide. While my memories of Pandæmonium are clear, all else is...hazy at best. Perhaps Athena made me this way, or...perhaps it is the result of who or what I was before. Still, I can recall vague figures. Scenes from my future, and your past... At the Crystal Tower's peak we clash. And later, from that selfsame spire, I send you forth... Into our age. Into Elpis. Why do I decide on such a course? Formless as these images are, I cannot say... ...However, I can hazard a guess. Somewhere within my fragmented memories, I catch a glimpse of our journey into Pandæmonium. A glimpse which shows not the path we took or the destination where it led us, yet by its very presence demands that you are required in Elpis. And even if that act is but one link in the chain of events which ends in Etheirys's salvation... Then this all has meaning. Our time together─every moment─is worthwhile... ...and I am unburdened by regret. That said, it is possible my motivations become something else entirely. That you would cross this vast expanse in the hopes of being reunited with your allies... A devotion that once would have baffled me. But after having been to the depths of that twisted prison and back, I think I can understand. Now, I have pulled back the curtain as far as I dare. The people of your age call this the aetherial sea─a name I quite enjoy. For it teems with life, each star a soul on its journey. And among these uncountable stars, it was yours that crossed my path. For that I shall be forever grateful. I wish you well on your journey. A journey as long as your star is bright─a journey not bound by the confines of this world, or any other. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------

**000:** Restoring the elements to the Empty may allow life to flourish there once more... But that isn't enough to return the environment to the way it was. No, we need to gradually reintroduce life, beginning with plants. Not just any plants, though, but those that won't be a burden on a weakened land... Such as...

**RYNE:** What will you say? You've become quite the scholar. I see you've taken an interest in gardening. How about coffee plants?

**BEQLUGG:** Oh! What a welcome surprise! It seems you caught me rambling to myself. How embarrassing... I've been studying botany, you see, hoping that the knowledge would help our work in the Empty. Coffee... If I recall correctly, it thrives in warm climates, with cooler nights to promote growth. Yes. Yes, that might be suitable. And with a good harvest, we could set some aside for coffee biscuits! Wait... It's you! It seems you caught me rambling to myself. How embarrassing... I've been studying botany, you see, hoping that the knowledge would help our work in the Empty. But never mind that for now. What brings you to the Crystarium? It was my understanding that the Final Days were behind us. You wish to combat this otherworldly threat with the power of Light...? Please let me help. Though I've lost my connection to Hydaelyn, I can still manipulate Light to a degree. If there is a chance I could save others with that power, then I have to try.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** 'Tis done. Zero is now with us in the flesh. The spirit vessel, I shall hold on to for operating the tower. This will help me to make sense of the controls, will it? There's a levity in his words that wasn't there before. It heartens me to know he is well. I shall see to the preparations as per his instructions.

**BEQLUGG:** My thanks for your help.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Think nothing of it. That said, 'tis customary that my kind receive fitting payment for services rendered...

**BEQLUGG:** Not unlike we voidsent, then. In that case, you may devour some of my aether.

**RYNE:** Are you mad? I'll do no such thing! The very suggestion is absurd!

**BEQLUGG:** Now, now, let's calm down. We all have our preferences, and I'm sure no offense was intended.

**RYNE:** I shall attend to the tower now. The rest, I leave to you.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero, was it? My name is Ryne. It's a pleasure to meet you.

**RYNE:** This world isn't what I expected. While Light is indeed strong here, it's not pervasive or overwhelming. Everything looks much as it does in the Source.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We have the Warrior of Darkness to thank for that. If you're interested, I would be glad to show you around.

**RYNE:** Just an ordinary sky. Ordinary...and beautiful. To think that, after so much loss, they could reclaim this... So this is the Flood of Light... I don't remember much of the time when Darkness consumed the Thirteenth. Just the cold and the emptiness...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero? Are you all right?

**RYNE:** ...Aye. I'm fine. You're the one who stopped this?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Oh, no no. That was the first Oracle of Light, Minfilia. She's since left us, but I inherited her power and legacy.

**RYNE:** I see... Let's get started then, shall we?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The other transmitters are set. Whenever you're ready.

**JULLUS:** Such radiant Light... It's almost too much for one steeped in Darkness like me...  

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Whatever may have happened in the past, you're still here, Zero. Alive. What you couldn't do yesterday, you might still do today.

**RYNE:** If this power were mine to wield... [CRY OF PAIN “Argh! Ahhhhhh!] Report if displayed. [ENDURING PAIN GRUNT “Urgh”] Report if displayed.  I will not succumb... Not to Darkness...nor to Light! [PSYCHING ROAR “Yaaaaaargh!”] Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero! She's...taken Light into herself! Her body struggles to contain it. She needs help.

**RYNE:** [FAINT GROAN “Ugh”] Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Thank goodness... How do you feel?

**RYNE:** Better now, I think.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Then you're very, very lucky. Whatever possessed you to do that?

**RYNE:** I had to know if I could command the Light. If I could change my fate. Once, I would never have dared to dream it. But your friendship and your trust has helped me to see new possibilities. In myself and everything else. Perhaps that's why, when I beheld this world once damned yet saved, I saw the potential for mine to be saved as well. To become a world where Light and Darkness are in harmony, and life flourishes. A world where we're not consumed by insatiable hunger, but filled with hope for what we might create together. If I had the strength, perhaps I could make such a dream reality. Perhaps I could awaken us from this endless nightmare. That's what possessed me...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** If that's your heartfelt desire, then you mustn't be afraid to share it. There was a time when I lacked the courage. To voice my desires was to burden those I love...or so I convinced myself. But then I met those who believed in me. They helped me to believe in myself and find the strength to live. And so long as I'm alive, I know that I'll be fine. No matter how dire things seem. No matter where I am. To be able to think that brought me peace, and it's a blessing I owe entirely to my friends.

**RYNE:** Those who believe in us... I will remember your words. I know all too well that there's a limit to what we can achieve alone.

**000:** As a friend, I'd like to help you fulfill your dream. If you wish to take in more Light, I can keep the power in check and help your body accept it.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? If anyone can do it, it'd be Ryne. It worked well enough for me. With the power of Light *and* Dark, you'll be unstoppable!

**RYNE:** So it would seem. Ah, yes. You mentioned having to absorb Light. That you still live is proof of her ability. I certainly hope so. Right, then. I'm counting on you. Here I go. [STRUGGLING TO ABSORB LIGHT EXERT] Report if displayed. I can feel it. The Light's warmth welling within me.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Then I believe it worked.

**YSHTOLA:** With this power, I will return to the void and fight─for the world that once was, and for those I hold dear!

**BEQLUGG:** All is in readiness. Without further ado, then... Light from beyond the rift, shine forth and banish the Darkness!

**LYNA:** Excellent. The tower is replete with Light from Nabaath Areng. Commencing transmission! It works! It works! Light is flowing into the void!

**RYNE:** May this Light illuminate your way!

**ESTINIEN:** You can do it, Zero. I believe in you.

**YSHTOLA:** Look─an opening!

**VRITRA:** It worked. Let us waste no time and sally forth. Alas, I fear the breach may be too narrow for you, Vrtra.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** For a blessing, I prepared my simulacrum for such an eventuality.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** My true form shall stand guard here while we explore the chasm. 'Tis faint, but I sense the presence of a dragon. No doubt my sister's essence trapped within Zeromus. Not where she was held captive before, but somewhere much deeper.

**YSHTOLA:** The descent will not be so easy this time. The chasm swarms with voidsent.

**ESTINIEN:** Summoned by Golbez, perhaps, or born of the residual Darkness.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** However they came to be, we shall cut a path through them. Is everyone ready? Zero...?

**YSHTOLA:** That Light should shine in the void once more...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** No single one of us could have made it so. Only by joining hands were we able to kindle this Light.

**DURANTE:** Do you see, Golbez? We needn't damn others to save ourselves. You knew this once, surely. When you tried to befriend me. When you were one of the precious few left willing to trust in another. But that man is gone, and in his place a mockery of his beliefs.   It's the same as before... Though we walk different paths, we seek the same destination. And yet... There is something I must know. A truth that lies waiting in the dark.

**YSHTOLA:** Golbez! This can't be happening... Not to you... My friend... My hero... I will stop you even should it cost me my life! [PANTING, DOWN ON ONE KNEE] Report if displayed. Why? Why you and not me? You were the best of us. A paragon of virtue. I could never hope to be your equal. I am only the knight I am because of you... Because you believed in me! [SWORD SWINGING EXERT] Report if displayed. [PANTING] Report if displayed. [PAINED LAUGHTER] Report if displayed. You would not wish to become a monster, preying upon those who've fought to protect. But neither can I bring myself to kill you. So rest easy, my friend, and entrust your legacy to me. You will never die, this I swear. Through me your name shall live on, as the hero who saves the world!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We've been released from the memory, 'twould seem.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** If Golbez was the one sealed in this memoria... Then the one we've been fighting is...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** No more than an impostor playing at hero.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Durante, I presume.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** A name long since lost to time. History shall remember only Golbez. Come what may, I shall deliver the world its salvation, and I will not suffer you to interfere.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** You seek to free all souls from the purgatory of undeath. And to that end, you would invade another world. While I cannot condone your methods, I understand your motive full well. For I'm driven by the same. I too wish to save our world. I too once thought I had to bear the burden by myself. That I had no choice but to walk my path alone. But I was wrong. We may yet strive together towards our shared goal, if you would reconsider your course.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** [CONDESCENDING CHUCKLE] Report if displayed. If you possessed power which transcended that of Zeromus, then perhaps I would. But you do not. No, you are but another voidsent, like me. And what is a candle before the sun?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Perhaps we aren't all-powerful and cannot effect great change in an instant. Even so...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Great change is what we need! Aught less has no meaning! Having glimpsed our past, you should understand as well as any. As Golbez, I dedicated myself to ending the Contramemoria. I fought the corrupted memoriates, and attempted to redeem those twisted by their power. Yet try as I might, I was powerless to make any meaningful change. 'Twas then, when I was floundering in despair, that she appeared─the Ascian Igeyorhm. Claiming to know how to excise the source of our woes, she showed me to the moon, where the servant of Light abided. 'Twas he and his ilk who had granted men unnatural powers, she said, and now prolonged the war. Believing her every word, I struck him down...and caused Darkness to engulf the world.

**YSHTOLA:** What!? Then it was you who...

**BLACKKNIGHT:** As Emet-Selch once told us, the Thirteenth was the Ascians' first attempt at a Rejoining, before they fully understood the mechanisms at play. They failed because they sought only to awaken the sundered Zodiark without instigating a calamity in the Source. The Darkness they unleashed had nowhere else to go...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Having left a ruin of our world, the Ascian fled. I was a fool to trust them. To trust in others. Since that day, I have sought the means to undo my mistake. The world may be beyond saving, but I would at least restore the great flow. The dragon was an extraordinary windfall. A veritable font of aether that expedited my endeavors time and again. But it wasn't enough to achieve my objective. Far from it. For an eternity, I had to bide my time. But the day finally came when I acquired the power I sought. Aye, the remnants of the Ascians' god sealed within the moon suddenly dispersed into aether. With that aether, Zeromus could be conceived. And driven by the dragon's longing for home, it shall soon arise to destroy the barrier between worlds. Thus will the way open to the promised land, and the death we have been too long denied. Thus will I, Golbez, bring salvation to all!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** So that is all you have left...

**ESTINIEN:** Say what you will. You cannot stop Zeromus's awakening.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** We're going after him, aren't we?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Aye. That's why we came, after all. And besides... When someone believes in you, it makes you want to believe in them. In others and yourself. Jullus was right about that.

**ESTINIEN:** I had hoped to bear witness to the moment our salvation is realized... But nothing must be left to chance. I will stop you here no matter the cost! [SPELLCASTING EXERT]

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** [JUMP EXERT] Report if displayed.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** [ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed.

**ESTINIEN:** [TAKINNG DAMAGE EXERT] Report if displayed.  Wounded as I am, I knew that I would be hard-pressed to fight you on equal terms. And so I lured you to this place, where the advantage is mine!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** The archfiends live!?

**YSHTOLA:** Impossible. Scarmiglione and Barbariccia were sealed in memoria, while Cagnazzo and Rubicante died in the Source...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** You are not wrong. They are not the true archfiends, but shades born of their residual aether.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** If they are shades, then their strength will pale in comparison. Even should they fight as one, we may yet prevail.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** We'll tend to the archfiends. Go and put an end to Zeromus.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** You'll do no such thing!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Go! We'll join you as soon as we can!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** [CHARGING TOWARD GOLBEZ EXERT]

**YSHTOLA:** [BLOCKING HIT EXERT]  It is too late. Zeromus *will* awaken, and it shall devour any who come between it and its desire. Your companion is no exception.

**ESTINIEN:** I wouldn't be so sure. Time and again, she has faced insurmountable odds.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** But no matter how hopeless things seemed, she's never given up the fight.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** [KNOCKING BACK ENEMY EXERT] Report if displayed. So long as he has strength of will to forge on, then so too shall we! So long as she has strength of will to forge on, then so too shall we!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** For we believe in her, and she believes in us. And together, our Light can pierce blackest Darkness! [CHARGING ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed.

**ZEROMUS:** [CHARGING ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed.

**000:** What is this Darkness, cold and all-consuming? Where am I? I must return to my world... To my home, where my kin await... Yes, I must return. I return. And none shall stand in my way!

**ZEROMUS:** What will you say? Release Azdaja! I can't let you destroy the barrier between worlds!

**ESTINIEN:** Begone from my sight!   Graaaaaah! [Report if displayed.] I shall not perish... So long as they await my return, I shall endure...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** [SWINGING LANCE EXERT] Report if displayed. Are you all right?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:**  [ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** [ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed. 

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Like all voidsent, Zeromus cannot be killed. Sealing it in memoria is the only way. Ah, that it should come to this... I failed my dear friend. Fell for the Ascians' ploy and unleashed the Darkness. And after an eternity of waiting, I find myself on my knees... How disappointed must you be in me. In the foolishness and futility of it all... [STRUGGLING TO STAND EXERT] No... I will not let it be for naught. I will not allow you to pass. I will triumph in my crusade!

**BLACKKNIGHT:** There is no triumph to be found in this madness. Even if the veil were to be unraveled, it would not undo what Darkness has done to the world. Nor would it bring Golbez back. From his slumber, you know there is no return. You're weak and imperfect. You know it in your heart. In spite of this, do you truly believe that you can save everyone? Are you sure you will not fail? I'm no better. Weak and imperfect and plagued by doubt. Which is why I need friends to walk beside me.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Light...? But how?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** This is proof that I believe in others, and they in turn believe in me. A light that illuminates the way in darkest despair. Be it in a ruined city locked in ice or a world drowning in Light, it was with faith in one another that life endured. I see it clearly now.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You think we are capable of the same?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** It won't be easy. Having lived too long as voidsent, we've forgotten how to trust. But one thing is certain: if Zeromus succeeds and everyone dies, we'll never have the chance to try. You asked me to join hands with you once, and I refused. I cannot take back that mistake, but I can extend to you the same offer. We can be better than we have been.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** [SHOCKED GASP, REMEMBERING SOMETHING] Report if displayed. Of course. You were the memoriate we met all those years ago... [BITTER LAUGHTER] Report if displayed. Yes, I remember now. We hoped you would join us in our quest to end the Contramemoria. But you rejected us outright. It left both of us discouraged─Golbez most of all. “If we could but overcome the fear that has shaped and divided us, we could change everything.” Even in the midst of that terrible war, he never stopped believing in others. Not even at the end...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** You're Golbez now. If you would live up to his name, then you must trust in people as he did.

**YSHTOLA:** I cannot forgive what you have done to my sister. But she may yet be saved. If you can help us see her safely home and protect the Source, then...

**BLACKKNIGHT:** As Zero's friends, we should gladly share what knowledge we have to help you restore the void.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** You truly believe the world of old can be ours again?

**VARSHAHNBIG:** I do. So long as we work together. We will disperse Zeromus's essence once more. The instant we do, you must call to Azdaja.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Understood!

**VARSHAHNBIG:** [LEAPING ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed. [GASP, TAKEN BY SURPRISE] Report if displayed.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Zero!

**ESTINIEN:** The suffocating Darkness... Like that of the rift... Impenetrable... Disorienting... Untethered and drifting further away...

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Be strong, Zero! Don't give up!

**YSHTOLA:** Hold fast to yourself! Look to the Light within!

**000:** Your place isn't alone in the Dark, Zero. Not anymore!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? You can do it, Zero! Are you all right, Zero?

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Hmph. Of course. Hmph. You needn't worry about me. With this power from beyond the rift, I can do it. I can save everyone! Golbez! If you would make amends, then lend me your strength!

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** [CHARGING ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** [CHARGING ATTACK EXERT] Report if displayed.

**AZDAJA:** Azdaja! Hear my voice...and return to me!

**YSHTOLA:** (-Azdaja-)Oh, Vrtra... There thou art... (-Azdaja-)I am coming, Brother... I am coming...

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Have care! Zeromus makes to resurrect!

**VARSHAHNBIG:** Not if I have anything to say about it! No more, fiend!

**ESTINIEN:** You're safe now, Azdaja. You're safe. To my sister, I shall offer up the eye in this vessel. We dragons bring forth progeny with our very life force. That which my eye harbors should be enough to grant her corporeal form. Of course, this means I shall no longer have control over this vessel. I must ask you escort Azdaja to the surface in my stead.

**VARSHAHNBIG:** [CLOSED-MOUTH LAUGH “Hmph”] Report if displayed. We came to bring her home, and we'll do just that. You have my word.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Thank you. At long last, we shall be together again.

**BLACKKNIGHT:** Where are you going?

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Our world may yet be restored. I thought it an impossible dream once, but having witnessed your miracles, I cannot help but believe. Nevertheless, I am the villain who wrought this tragedy. And in my misguided crusade, I compounded my sins. My place is not at your side.

**VRITRA:** [WEARY SIGH] Report if displayed. Regardless of how you may feel, by lending me your strength, you've made amends. You've earned a new beginning. It's up to you what we become to one another. What we couldn't do yesterday, we might still do today. Working together. And should we want for strength, we need only rally more like-minded souls to our cause. So let's take the first step. The two of us.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Words cannot well express my relief that we could rescue my sister, nor my gratitude to all of you. What of him? Golbez.

**VRITRA:** He felt it would be inappropriate for him to be present at your reunion with Azdaja, and chose to remain down in the chasm. If you wish to hear an apology, however, I should be glad to drag him here.

**ESTINIEN:** Nay, that shall not be necessary. By his deeds hath he demonstrated his contrition.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** So, what will you do now?

**ESTINIEN:** I've learned much journeying together with you. Experienced things I could never have experienced alone. Together with Golbez, I hope to do the same as we labor to restore the Thirteenth.

**YSHTOLA:** Then I suppose it's farewell for now.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Be sure to share with Golbez what you've learned of the Source and its reflections, as well as the true nature of Light and Dark. He is as resourceful as he is determined, and will surely make the very most of the insights.

**YSHTOLA:** Indeed. Once we've gained a better understanding of the situation, I hope we can rely on your counsel.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** But of course. I too shall continue probing new possibilities, the better to be of aid when the time comes. Ah, speaking of which... From ocean rise and cloudbank form,
From mountain spring and rainfall storm,
From river flow and life be born... Come forth, my servant! I revised the incantation. Which is not to say you know how it went before... Are we clear? Nidhana provided me with spare warding scales, which apparently provide greater protection than before. This should keep the familiar safe. So long as you give the nixie aether from time to time, it will persist and serve as a beacon for us to find you.

**YSHTOLA:** Already we find ourselves with a new ally. Thank you. When you have the chance, please thank everyone for me. Those in Radz-at-Han, Garlemald, Sharlayan... ...the First, and on the moon. A lengthy list. A gift for Ryne, in return for the Light she helped me harness. It's the memoria holding Zeromus. If used to augment Darkness in the First, it may help to create balance between our worlds.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** An excellent idea. Similarly, why not entrust the archfiends' memoria to Zero?

**000:** In that case, I shall pass them on to Golbez. To inspire and admonish him in equal measure.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** What will you say? I'll see you again, right? The Thirteenth is in good hands. You should know about Unukalhai and Cylva...

**VRITRA:** You will, I'm sure. Just don't try to forcibly summon me. I won't come. Come what may, we will see it restored. And should we need a helping hand, I hope we can count on you once more. What? There are others from our world who seek to restore it? Then please tell them this: though we are worlds apart, in our shared objective, we walk as one.

**MYSTERIOUSPERSON:** Sad though it is to say farewell, 'tis past time we returned home. Pray climb upon my back.

**JULLUS:** Till we meet again. No matter where we are or how much time passes, our bond will endure. This I believe.

**ALPHINAUD:** Oh, it's you again. Is everything all right?

**ALISAIE:** So you were able to rescue Azdaja... Thank the Twelve.

**YSHTOLA:** Channeling Light from the First was rather ingenious. It may fall short of cross-rift travel, but it's still an impressive achievement in my book.

**JULLUS:** You're too kind. Suffice it to say, though, that I don't intend to rest on these laurels. There's always more to be done.

**000:** Zero stayed in the void, did she? Well...if I had known it would come to that, I would've said a proper farewell.

**JULLUS:** What will you say? Zero took your words to heart. Zero sends her thanks.

**ALISAIE:** Really...? I don't remember saying anything profound... Thanks for what? I don't recall doing anything in particular for her. On the contrary, she's the one who risked life and limb. Still...I'm glad that she got something out of her time here. As the days roll on, things will change for the both of us. But some things will remain as they are. As far as I'm concerned, Zero will always be a friend and comrade. And I will never forget her.

**JULLUS:** If she's working tirelessly to restore the Thirteenth, it wouldn't do to be outdone here. When next Zero visits, we must see to it that you have a shiny new Garlemald to show her.

**ALPHINAUD:** Indeed... And speaking of rebuilding, there's a matter I'd like to discuss with you and Alphinaud. Word has spread of our dealings with Radz-at-Han, and people are excited by the prospect of standing on our own two feet again. Naturally, it won't be straightforward─it never is─but on the whole, I have a good feeling about things.

**JULLUS:** In other words...it may be time for us to limit our involvement, that Garleans might take the lead? I can see the sense in that.

**ALISAIE:** No, no, that's not what I meant at all. Seeing as things are going well, we want you to take a rest. A *proper* rest. That's what I wanted to say, on everyone's behalf. You've done so much for us already. Toiled beside us in the cold for far longer than anyone could ask. You've earned a reprieve a hundred times over. So go on, step away from here and head...wherever you like. But if it were me, I'd choose somewhere warm.

**ALPHINAUD:** I was thinking of taking a break anyway...

**ALISAIE:** Far be it from us to go against such a heartfelt request. Though I would be lying were I to say matters here wouldn't weigh on our minds...

**ALPHINAUD:** We could take a leaf out of Zero's book and roam about for a while. Maybe visit nations who share little history with Garlemald─look for opportunities to foster future relations. We might learn something of recent foreign affairs that has escaped our notice.

**JULLUS:** Hm, as an independent party, we would be well suited to the task... An excellent idea, Alisaie.

**ALPHINAUD:** Well, that hardly sounds like a rest at all.

**ALISAIE:** To us, it is the best kind of rest─stimulating and meaningful.

**YSHTOLA:** If it's settled, then let's return to Sharlayan and consider our options. What about the rest of you? Do you have any plans?

**ALPHINAUD:** We're indebted to Lord Fourchenault and his colleagues for their cooperation. 'Twould be meet to report on the outcome of our mission.

**BEQLUGG:** Then it seems we are all bound for Sharlayan. Upon arriving, let us seek out Atheleys at the Rostra and have her notify Father.

**LYNA:** Ah yes, the king has already shared what they glimpsed in the Source. The day is won, and the danger passed. Hearing the tidings lifted a great weight from my shoulders. Never before had I taken on such a monumental request.

**RYNE:** Small though it was, we are glad to have played a role in saving the Exarch's home, and yours. Furthermore, the endeavor served to reaffirm the bond between the peoples of Norvrandt. Nurturing this bond, we will strive to be an example for the world Zero aspires to restore.

**BEQLUGG:** Is that...a memoria crystal? I can feel it... The tremendous Darkness within... Using Darkness from the void to restore balance to this world... If such a thing could be done...!

**RYNE:** Well, well... Though night has returned to our world, Darkness cannot arise of its own accord, much less in abundance. But if it could be brought here in like manner to how we channeled Light to the void, it may well be possible to restore the Empty in its entirety! Do you still have that spirit vessel with you? If so, I beg you loan it to me for a time. I would use it to investigate a way to have the tower receive rather than send energy. Thank you. I shall commence my work at once in concert with Unukalhai, and rigorously explore the possibility. Thank you. While I make no promises at this stage, I shall rigorously explore the possibility.

**GAIA:** I too need to explore new possibilities for my powers. My recent experience at Nabaath Areng has taught me that. To that end, I will set aside botany for a time, and focus instead on myself. Knowing Zero is out there, doing her utmost to restore her own world... It inspires me to redouble my efforts!

**RYNE:** There you are. I waited and waited, but you never came. What have you been doing here?

**GAIA:** Gaia!

**000:** Oh! Do I know you?

**GAIA:** What will you say? Don't tell me you've lost your memory again!? We promised to go for coffee biscuits, remember?

**RYNE:** Oh, I'm just teasing. I wouldn't forget you in a hurry. I'm still keeping my diary, adding new memories to it every day.

**GAIA:** Not only that, Gaia's writing a story too. I can't wait for it to become a book!

**RYNE:**   I never agreed to anything of the sort. Besides, coffee biscuits are old news. I'd rather try something else.

**GAIA:** What? I thought you liked them too... Well, no matter. The Second Serving has something for every taste, so let's just go!

**NAHBDEEN:** Enough about that. What were you talking about? Harnessing Darkness from the void... Now there's an idea. Of course, if you're dealing with Darkness, Ryne alone won't cut it. Next time, call on me as well. All right?

**NIDHANA:** It cannot be... Oh, Varshahn, my darling little brother... To think that I will never see you again...

**NAHBDEEN:** The way you carry on, anyone would think he was actually your brother... Save your tears, now. His Excellency still has one of his eyes. And he has made it clear he intends to continue using his vessel. You'll see Varshahn again, never fear!

**NIDHANA:** Truly? But...will it be the little one?

**NAHBDEEN:** Personally, I prefer the adult vessel. It cuts a gallant figure, and has superior functionality besides.

**NIDHANA:** Bah, I don't care about such things! My little brother is... Little! And adorable!

**YSHTOLA:** Sisters give me strength...

**ESTINIEN:** 'Tis a fine thing being so loved.

**YSHTOLA:** Had enough of the revelry, have you? So, what's next for our hero? No need to decide just yet. You'll recall our escapades in the void began with a treasure map I paid entirely too much gil for. You can't force an adventure. It'll happen when it happens, and you'll know when the time is right. Till then, it's good to lend an ear to others and their tales. And speaking of others...

**SYSTEM:** Discussing each other's plans, are we? Alas, I have nothing exciting to share. I foresee an extended confinement in my Sharlayan chambers, compiling my theories on cross-rift travel. My research may be classified, prohibited by the powers that be... But so long as a bond exists between people, ever shall our worlds be connected. As it stands, a means to travel to the First is within reach, and I would be satisfied even should my research not exist in an official capacity. And what of you, Estinien? Have you any plans? [CHUCKLE] Report if displayed.  He never was one to stay put for long. Though I've no doubt he will make himself known when needed.

**KRILE:** Meanwhile, in Old Sharlayan...

**ERENVILLE:** Everything appears to be in order... Ahhh! Finished at last. So time-consuming... How nice would it be to have a mammet to handle such tasks. Now then, let's have a look at you. Quite old, this letter. We'll need to store it carefully. [GASP] Report if displayed.  Addressed to Grandfather! And come all the way from Tuliyollal, from a Guloo...someone. The ink's too faded. Hardly anything is legible. Come on, give me something... A commission to investigate the golden city...in Tural!? How odd... No one ever mentioned such a commission, nor have I seen any records. Hm? Something else in here... What an unusual earring. How does it relate to the petition, I wonder... Did you go there, Grandfather? To the golden city, in Tural?
