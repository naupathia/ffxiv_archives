---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Man of the Flour (4103048)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I Melt with You (4127397)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter Beastman (4089340)

The kobolds of O'Ghomoro have once again descended into Cedarwood, blatantly disregarding the treaty formed between the beast tribe and Limsa Lominsa which strictly forbids the kobolds from extending their claims beyond the northern reaches of outer La Noscea.

Giant crabs known as snippers have invaded the once-pristine beaches of Bloodshore, making it difficult for Costa del Sol retirees to take their morning walks without having their raiments sliced to ribbons.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the Light (4138603)

The mischievous spirits of fallen pirates are luring drowsy Costa del Sol retirees from their bedchambers into the churning sea. Save the poor septuagenarians so that they may continue to spend their hard-earned wealth at the Flying Shark. Now open for brunch!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a Matter of Rut (4142080)

The buffaloes of Bloodshore are in rut, and a shortage of females this season means that the males who have yet to find mates are especially violent. Deal with the roused beasts before they harm themselves or others.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely, Positively (4176042)

An important missive from the Admiral must be delivered to South Tidegate. See to it the storm courier tasked with carrying the message reaches her destination unharmed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tender Buttons (4126638)

Gluttonous Gertrude was just another plump dodo on the farm...until she bit the arse off one of the stable boys at Swiftperch and escaped into Quarterstone. Seek out the ravenous bird and slay her before another rump goes missing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shredding Wheat (4127148)

The wheat fields abandoned after the Calamity have turned into a breeding ground for wild animals who prey on Swiftperch's crops and stock. Drive the creatures from the overgrowth and slay as many as possible.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
(I Just) Died in Six Arms Tonight (4127689)

It is believed most crabs only live for two to three years─fewer if nearby Lominsans are hungry. There is one crab, however, that is rumored to have survived since the Fifth Astral Era, surviving on the blood of man (though no one can truly back that claim). All things must die, and Old Six-arms's time has come.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Iron Contra Affair (4127692)

Don't Call Him a Fishback (4172426)

Letters from Tidegate (4127838)

A letter carrier tasked with delivering messages from soldiers on the front lines back to their loved ones in Limsa Lominsa is being harassed by bandits who seek to claim the personal effects enclosed in the packages. Slay the perpetrators and defend the young man.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Last Straw (4179973)

What nature did not reclaim of Quarterstone after the Calamity, the dodos did, but now it is time to take the land back. Destroy nests and drive the cloudkin from the fields, so that the settlers might piece back together their lives.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Barometz Soup (4127702)

Already known for its size in the Sixth Astral Era, the overgrown landtrap Barometz has grown even larger since the Calamity, feeding on weakened dodos and aldgoats until reaching its current size of almost two score hands. Slice it down to size, or you might be its next victim!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goblin Chain (4142244)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tryp Fantastic (4142246)

The goblins encamped in Skull Valley have hired a named mercenary to help them raid the nearby farmsteads. Hunt down Tryptix Stumblemox and slay him.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Between Aurochs (4142248)

Several aurochs have begun grazing alongside the De Nevelle Westroad, frightening merchants and preventing the transport of goods to and from the area. Use any means necessary to urge the beasts from the thoroughfare.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Sac (4177389)

A killer mantis egg sac has burst open, releasing countless of the deadly vilekin into western La Noscea. It is best they are slain now while young before given the opportunity to live up to their name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Simurgh Is the Word (4142250)

Simurgh, a colossal cloudkin who is thought to nest high upon O'Ghomoro, has descended into upper La Noscea to feed─his prey of choice? Lalafells. Slay the creature before he finds his next tender, juicy victim.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Surprise (4315156)

Nine-ilm Snails (4305959)

Not a day passes without the physickers of the Warmwine Sanitorium having to clean their bathing pools of uragnite hatchlings, and they have had enough. They seek volunteers to hunt down and slay the root of the problem─the adult creatures laying the eggs in the springs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Truth in Faerie Tales (4305992)

Legend says deep beneath the waters of Bronze Lake dwells a terrible creature with jaws so powerful they can tear a man in two with a single bite. Common sense would suggest that Oannes is merely a tale to frighten babes, but the local smallfolk would have us believe otherwise.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Giant Enemy Crab (4306003)

A crab released into Bronze Lake by Qiqirn so that the beastmen might harvest its sweet eggs has grown into an uncontrollable nuisance. Not only does it not produce any eggs of its own (on the account of being a male), it also ravages the nests of the local waterfowl, devouring their eggs. Karkinos must be slain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shell Shocked (4306034)

Heated by the molten rock coursing deep below O'Ghomoro, the waters of Bronze Lake are warm year-round. This unique environment has allowed creatures, which normally only grow to a few ilms, to balloon into terrifying monstrosities. The wavekin Zoredonite is one such abomination.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Peeping Ja (4321582)

After repeatedly harassing a party of Miqo'te bathers, a Mamool Ja mercenary who goes by the name of Scarface Bugaal Ja was banned for life from the hot springs at Camp Bronze Lake. The degenerate, however, is back once again, and must needs be dealt with.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hop, Skip, and a Jump (4306073)

A plague of waterskipper yarzons has converged upon the shores of Bronze Lake, looking to lay eggs. Waterskipper numbers are already at an all-time high, and if any more were allowed to hatch, the area would be overrun with the ravenous pests. Slay the yarzons before they can mate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the Bridge (4108253)

More and more merchants are refusing to make the trip to the Gods' Grip due to rumors of a giant wolflike creature called Padfoot who is said to hide below Oschon's Embrace, attacking any who attempt to cross the bridge. Hunt the beast down and restore peace to the area.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Consigned, Sealed, and Undelivered (4142241)

An important client of Master Gegeruju's─one Aismurl Goldmember─is visiting Costa del Sol to complete a sizable business transaction. To ensure that things go smoothly, the master has prepared a special incentive for his guest...and she requires proper escort to Hidden Falls.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Not Lupus (4177475)

Claws so powerful they can split a rock in two. A shell so hard, not even the hammer of a mighty hecatoncheir can crack it. Cancer, a crab rumored to have been spawned in the heavens, has appeared in eastern La Noscea. Slay him and become the stuff of legends!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mandragoras (4758630)

Sensing weakness in the realm following the Calamity, five rogue vegetables (well, technically four and a fruit) have risen up to rid the land of all meat─including YOU. Cool off the Mandragoras before their verdant insurgence gains steam.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Needles to Slay (4098136)

Needles shed by cactuars are the number four cause of foot irritation in all western Thanalan. By slaying a few cactuars, we can see that number drop to sixth, or even seventh!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Things that Make You Go Home (4103513)

Land purchased by a wealthy real estate mogul for development into luxury estates has become overrun with yarzons. Slay the vilekin before someone sees them and property values drop.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deface the Facts (4098196)

Now banished from Ul'dah for various acts of vandalism and basic thuggery, a gang of unruly, yet simply adorable, goblin muggers has made its way to Hammerlea where the beastmen have found a new favorite pastime─the destruction of random items lying about the Hammers. It is time they were shown some tough love.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Please Hammers, Don't Hurt Them (4098811)

Hammer beaks have drawn too close to the Silver Bazaar for comfort, causing many a sleepless night for the hamlet's residents. Become the anvil which stops the cloudkin's advance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cores (4103833)

The workers of Hammerlea require earth sprite cores to help harden the land before they can drive their massive piles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Doomed (4099169)

Before the Calamity, the Brass Blades were flooded with reports of a giant toad-like creature roaming the desert, lapping up poor Lalafellin travelers with its long, sticky tongue. Now, ten summers later, rumors of a “doomed gigantoad” are surfacing once again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Villain (4107936)

No one knows why Cactuar Jack feels the need to rain his hundred needles down upon all who happen by, because few have lived long enough to ask him...not that he would answer if he were asked, or that anyone would be able to understand him if he were to answer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Copied Peistes (4103548)

The shorthanded Brass Blades desperately seek aid in ridding the area of deadly peistes, who, without any predators save man, continue to multiply at an alarming rate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dog Eat Dog (4103575)

Feral packs of diseased dogs roam the desert attacking anyone carrying anything resembling food...or anyone resembling food, for that matter. Put the beasts down before a poor Lalafell becomes lunch.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bigger Fish to Fry (4104205)

Unable or unwilling to tackle larger prey, orobon tend to feed on young fish. The lack of young fish leads to an eventual lack of old fish, putting those fishers of Crescent Cove who rely on the sea's bounty to make their living in quite a predicament. Help solve their trouble by dealing with the root of the problem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bubble Trouble (4104245)

Several crab-loving fishers have journeyed to the Footfalls in search of a giant delicacy-to-be known to the locals as Bubbly Bernie. Unfortunately, without some help, it looks like the fishers are going to be the ones to get served.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tripped Up by the Fruit of Another (4176112)

A merchant en route to Vesper Bay was attacked by a pack of jackals after slipping and falling on a sun lemon rind left discarded by a traveling lemoncake monger. He requests an escort to the port town as he does not believe he can make it alone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Juggernaut Down (4103646)

A unit of Garlean soldiers is sifting through the wreckage of a fallen imperial juggernaut, presumably searching for any salvageable pieces of magitek equipment. Engage the unit and see its members are unable to report their findings to Castrum Marinum.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Matter of Rust (4103750)

After devouring all the ore remaining in a nearby abandoned mine, a sizable pack of coblyns has set out into the desert in search of new feeding grounds. Amajina & Sons will suffer the pilfering of their yet-to-be-claimed resources no more, and seek the immediate eradication of the pests. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
There Might Be Giants (4103910)

A giant in Thanalan! It is not yet known whence he came, but it is known whither he must needs go─straight to the seventh hell!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pound for Pound (4103844)

The incessant hammering of hammer beaks' hammer-like beaks is causing local settlers a great deal of lost sleep. Help the poor smallfolk strike at their problem while the iron is hot.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
He's Got Legs (4103581)

Unofficial studies conducted by unauthorized persons claim that more Ul'dahn children are orphaned by bloody attacks on their parents by a terrible creature called Daddy Longlegs than by any other means. In the time you take to question this claim, another child may be orphaned. Are you willing to take that risk!?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Staying Dead (4103924)

The restless spirits of fishers lost at sea have wandered back, unable to break their ties with the corporeal world. Purify these poor souls so that they may continue their journey into Thal's realm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Something to Prove (4104310)

Ever since being denied entry into the Pugilists', Gladiators', Lancers', Marauders', and Archers' Guilds, Grishild the Ungood has taken to challenging anyone and everyone to duels, hoping to prove her detractors wrong. Or perhaps she's simply a masochist.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Like an Eft out of Water (4104320)

Drawn by the sumptuous scent of roasting meat and hot mulled wine, efts have crawled out from the muddy flats of their normal habitat to dine at nearby cookfires. Slay a few so that the kindly father may roast them up for his starveling sons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrecked Rats (4104341)

Cockeyed Qiqirn denied entry to the Coffer & Coffin have not taken the news well and are causing trouble for the heavy who was hired to keep characters like these from causing trouble. Lend the poor lad a hand in helping the beastmen sober up.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Survivor Rats (4104356)

A band of Qiqirn bandits has left its camp in search of fresh prey, and the Brass Blades are bent on seeing the beastmen's efforts end in failure. All aid provided by adventurers will be noted and duly rewarded.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cracked (4105922)

As his colorful moniker suggests, notorious Qiqirn bandit Babaroon Halfshell prefers his prey firm on the outside and runny on the inside─something to keep in mind when he has you in an iron cookpot, boiling over an open flame. Now get cracking before he grows hungry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Orobon Part Two: The Spawning (4105925)

A poor boy whose father was eaten by an orobon (yes, an orobon) has sworn bloody revenge against the terrible wavekin who rendered him a starveling orphan. While it won't bring his father back, the indiscriminate slaying of random orobon may just help restore the sparkle in the young boy's eyes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Let them Eat Cactus (4105938)

Appalled that the displaced souls living in the shantytowns beneath the towering city walls of Ul'dah are driven to eat rat tails and coblyn legs just to survive, the sultana has ordered her subjects to procure edible cactus leaves and distribute them to the starving masses.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
For the Queen (4105998)

Giant antling sentries are on the march, most likely in search of Lalafellin children to snatch up and take back to their queen. Slay the vilekin before they catch the scent of a plump, innocent morsel.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Few Arrows Short of a Quiver (4106037)

The summer home of Eolande Quiveron─former Syndicate member, before tragically losing her life in the Calamity─has been occupied by thieving bandits, one even claiming, in fact, to be the noble lady's heir. Rumor has it the bandits use the run-down manor to hide their booty, and a merchant is seeking aid in recovering his stolen goods.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Big Time (4121880)

Fear of being pummeled by sledgehammer beaks is preventing miners from delivering their ore to assayers in Ul'dah. The Brass Blades seek help in clearing the Royal Allagan Starway of any and all threats.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold-blooded (4106053)

A terrible monster, known as Vodyanoi, living in the pools beneath the Unholy Heir has been seen dragging his victims into the water, where he lies upon them until they asphyxiate. One would think that the wavekin then eats his prey, but such is not the case, as the corpses are left to drift in the pools until they are consumed by jackals and carrion crows. Could it be that Vodyanoi kills merely for pleasure!?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Warm Welcome (4106055)

Descended from Coerthas in search of warm stones, a spriggan known in the north as Spitfire is terrorizing the local smallfolk and hoarding precious ores and gems intended for sale to the Goldsmiths' Guild. Give the crafty creature a good cuffing and send him on his way back home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaving the Nest (4104716)

The nest commander─a giant antling from Hellsbrood Holes─is out hunting again. Volunteers are wanted to see the violent vilekin slain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Men Who See Goats (4108037)

Packs of wild myotragus have left their mountain homes to forage in the lowlands. The beastkin are known to eat anything and everything, and if not stopped and driven back to the crags, they will more than likely consume what precious little foliage remains in Thanalan.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
License to Quill (4108047)

Tuco-tuco quills are prized for their durability, and sought by weavers across the realm to use as sewing and knitting needles. The spines of steelquill tuco-tucos, however, are a different story. When shed along the Royal Sunway, they can cause grievous injuries to chocobos and other beasts of burden who use the roads. Slay steelquill tuco-tucos, and keep the thoroughfares clear.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Westward Bound (4106191)

An Amalj'aa unit has been sighted moving west, most likely to establish a new encampment closer to Ul'dah. The safety of the city–state is at stake. Crush the beastmen and send them running back to Zanr'ak.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad Camp (4106224)

The Amalj'aa stationed in their eastern Thanalan encampment have begun preparing for a large-scale foray into Ul'dahn territory. Foil their plans by destroying supply crates and slaying the encampment leader, Glassjaw Nazagg Gah.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bazaar Blood Triangle (4099281)

A unit of Amalj'aa raiders has forced its way into the Golden Bazaar in search of slaves and supplies. Aid the Brass Blades stationed in the hamlet in fending off the attackers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Grim Undertakings (4106230)

A malevolent spirit, freed from his subterranean prison when the Calamity unearthed the Invisible City, is indiscriminately attacking those who journey into the ruins in search of fortune and knowledge. Seek out the Undertaker and release his soul from the fetters of the corporeal realm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Simple Minds (4106673)

A gang of mischievous imps fancying themselves footpads has taken to assaulting travelers passing through eastern Thanalan. Chase off the voidsent and see the roads safe once more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Manifest Destiny (4106679)

Amalj'aa lancers approach from the east! Engage the beastmen before they can reach Highbridge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spare the Hair (4106236)

An old wives' tale states that if the monster Gossamer comes to you in your sleep, you will awake as bald as a melon. Middle-aged men across the realm, unite─for the bane must be quelled!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Desert Rose (4106689)

Riding on the dry north winds out of the Black Shroud, kedtrap seeds have taken root in Thanalan. Without any natural predators, the seedkin are free to roam the desert unchecked, consuming everything in their path. The creatures must be tended to before they render the desert even more deserted than it already is!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Almost Paradise (4125796)

Anyone who has been to Drybone can easily see how the place earned its name. It is an unforgiving place─arid and dry beyond compare. What little water can be found in the area is so prized, men have been known to trade gold just for a sip. This is why the few springs must be protected from those who would foul them─slugs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep in the Heart of Sagolii (4106697)

Elder longhorns are extremely territorial and will attack anything which draws too close to their dens. This is fine when those dens are at the top of unscalable peaks, but when they lie within earshot of well-traveled caravan roads, things can become quite hairy. Drive the goats back to the mountains where they belong.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Adventures in Throat Slitting (4165253)

The leader of the ill-famed Corpse Brigade, Milleuda the Slitter, has finally emerged from hiding to lead her men on a raid into the nearby hills. Use the opportunity to slay the killer and bring an end to her bloody reign.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Corpse Bribe (4106708)

Once an arm of the proud Ala Mhigan army, the Corpse Brigade has devolved into a band of bandits and petty thieves, albeit well-trained ones. Several of the former soldiers earn their keep by setting up illegal roadblocks and demanding coin for passage. Show the curs that the sultana will not allow such acts under her rule.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Downwind (4106711)

A pack of violent sandskin peistes has been drawn to Little Ala Mhigo by the stench of the latrine pits which surround the mesa caves the Ala Mhigan refugees call home. While many of the settlers can hold their own in a fight, the sheer number of peistes may prove too much for the encampment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Soul Man (4108098)

A naturalist from Ul'dah is seeking to discover the secrets behind the force animating the silent stone creatures guarding the ruins at the Sunken Temple of Qarn, and will pay good gil for each soulstone extracted from the hearts of the golems.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bigger than Life (4288495)

Naturalists claim that it can take almost four score summers for an adamantoise to grow to full size. If that is to be believed, then one can only imagine how many summers it took for Aspidochelone to achieve its colossal mass...or how much it had to consume.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heroes of the 2nd (4322536)

The Immortal Flames 2nd Main Brigade is moving to assault an Amalj'aa strongpoint and seeks reinforcements to help prevent its ranks from being flanked by the enemy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Diamond in the Rough (4314078)

A great Ul'dahn general once said, “There is no need for defense when one is always on the offensive.” Assault the Zanr'ak encampment and slay the commanding officer Diamondjaw Nezedd Gah before he gathers his troops to march on Little Ala Mhigo.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Children of the Sands (4142253)

The U tribe of Forgotten Springs, also known as the Children of the Sands, has gathered for the hunt. Join the savage beauties as they test their mettle against the giant sandworms of the Sagolii.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Return to Cinder (4288511)

The Zanr'ak altar is used to augur the outcome of future battles between the Amalj'aa and Ul'dah, and it is Cindersoot Pegujj Chah who throws the bones. Slay the mesmerizer and see that his fortune-telling days come to a bloody end.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hunters and the Hunted (4322742)

A party of Amalj'aa warriors has gone foraging into Ul'dahn territory, raiding granaries and claiming livestock. Intercept the beastmen and beat them back to their mountain stronghold.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
From Point A (4141188)

Relics uncovered from the ruins at Byregot's Strike must first be cataloged in Forgotten Springs before being delivered to Arrzaneth Ossuary for further study. Escort the Stone Torch tasked with transporting the items from the dig site to the oasis, and see that she arrives safely.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run Like a Flame (4098130)

A flame scout caught spying on the Amalj'aa in Zanr'ak has escaped his captors and is making way to the aetheryte in Little Ala Mhigo, so that he may relay his findings to the Hall of Flames. The Amalj'aa, however, are in close pursuit and will do anything to see that their secrets remain hidden. Protect the scout at all costs!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood, Augur, Hex, Magicks (4107752)

The Immortal Flames have pinpointed the whereabouts of one Blackbile Maladd Chah─an Amalj'aa hexweaver thought to be behind the assassinations of several high-ranking flame officials. Track down the terrible warlock and send him back to the Lifestream.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fish out of Water (4108107)

During the Calamity, the land's aetherial balance was disturbed─the result being a myriad of unexplained phenomena which has botanists and naturalists puzzled. What the scholars can agree on, however, is that the balance must be restored, and that means eradicating the problems as they emerge─and anglers in the desert certainly can be classified as one of those problems.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Harder, Bigger, Faster, Stronger (4106715)

After years of experimentation, Amalj'aa beast tamers have finally perfected a new breed of biologically augmented drakes and have moved to testing the creatures in the field. Use this opportunity to slay the war creatures before they are taken back to their cages.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
With One Eye Open (4317448)

Since the Calamity, the workers of Bluefog have told stories of a terrible one-eyed creature who would come in the night to carry sleeping men away from their campfires, never to be seen again. No one believed them...until a high-ranking Ul'dahn noble was snatched from his caravan. Now the city–state wants this Arimaspi's blinker on a pike.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the Nails (4317494)

Plans to expand the Ceruleum Processing Plant are in motion, with the next step being to clear the nearby land of the massive crystal protrusions known as Dalamud's Talons. To do that, however, the area must first be rid of the hostile basilisks who hunt there.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Boom Goes the Ceruleum (4317574)

Ceruleum is a highly flammable substance, and even the tiniest of sparks could cause an explosion, which is why the Ceruleum Processing Plant in Bluefog is especially wary of voidsent grenades straying too near the storage and rendering tanks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Knock on Steel (4317657)

The imperial army's mad engineers have developed a new grade of armor plating for their warmachina and are already testing it out on their magitek vanguards. If the Grand Companies of Eorzea are to stand against the Empire, they must know the extent of Garlemald's defenses; thus, they seek adventurers to test their weapons on these mechanical beasts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Poor Maid's Mess (4102592)

Most likely assuming that there would still be poor maids living there, former-pirates-turned-model-citizens have exchanged their cutlasses for brooms and hammers in an effort to restore Poor Maid's Mill to its former pre-Calamity glory. Aid the men and women in clearing the farmstead of rats who now infest the ruins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Poor Maid's Mishap (4102658)

A band of kobolds led by 382nd Order Pickman Ge Bu has descended on Poor Maid's Mill in search of food and supplies. Aid the Salthounds in driving back the beastmen and defeating their commander.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Poor Maid's Misfortune (4102690)

The Salthounds looking to restore Poor Maid's Mill cannot seem to catch a break, as now a pack of bloodthirsty coeurls has surrounded the ruins and has already dragged a few of the injured boatswains off into the wood. Join hands with the former pirates as they attempt to defend their little piece of La Noscea.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Revenge of the Worms (4142254)

At a glance, sandworms seem little more than mindless minions of the desert, but it is now believed that each worm is bound to the others in their community, forming a sort of “hive mind” which recognizes when one part of the group has been injured or killed.

Baa Baa Black Sheep (4257948)

A legend amongst local Coerthan shepherds, Downy Dunstan is said to have wool as black as night and as soft as cloud. The problem is, most are never able to get close enough to the sheep to shear him properly, and those who are usually end up sacrificing a finger or two in the attempt. If someone were to pacify the beast, there would surely be those who would pay generously.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gavial (4284060)

Nobles and their pets. One day they will see some tiny creature from the window of their pillowed carriage and simply have to have it...that is, until it grows too large and violent for their quaint seaside villa, at which time they order their majordomo to toss it back into the wild, it now having learned to loathe all who might take advantage of it once again, until it finally has to be put down.

Whiteout (4265965)

A blinding snowstorm on Abalathia's Spine has caused a pack of goobbues to lose its way and wander down into the more heavily populated areas of the Coerthas highlands.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Fire in the Distance (4258040)

Nothing is worse than being caught in a snowstorm at night than being caught in a snowstorm at night and falling into a bottomless ravine because you thought you spied a lantern in the distance...which actually turned out to be a will-o'-the-wisp.

Giant Seps (4258340)

Riddle Me This (4279902)

Judge, Jury, and Executioner (4280848)

Dragonflies of the Dravanian Horde have gathered before Ishgard's final line of land defense─the Gates of Judgement. If the bastion is compromised, the Horde's wingless ground troops will gain entry to the city–state and thousands of lives will be lost. The gates must be defended at all costs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
What's on Your Mind (4285072)

Very little is known about the void other than that the laws that govern our realm do not always apply. In addition to one-eyed monstrosities, peculiar balls of fur, and nightmarish demons, oddities such as floating orbs of energy also periodically break through the boundaries that separate this realm from the void. Make no mistake, however, everything through those rifts does not belong in Eorzea and must be destroyed.

The Bigger They Are (4258390)

If This Wall Could Talk (4285259)

With a team of naturalists from across the realm working day and night to discover the origins of Snowcloak and how it might be destroyed, there is one thing they have uncovered─that energy from ice sprites actually works to increase the thickness of the wall.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Inspector Hatchet (4291340)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mud about You (4259476)

The endless maze of roots and trees already creates enough trouble for those travelers who brave the Tangle; the last thing any of them want to think upon is how to fend off a pack of hungry mudpuppies. Clear the waters of these wavekin, but ware the morbols lurking nearby.

Black and Nburu (4309001)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Standing Guard (4259592)

Garlean engineers are constantly at work modifying and improving the design of their machina. A new make of vanguard, the H-3, has recently been deployed into the field for testing. Destroy them and stall the march of imperial progress.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
One Giant Leap (4308137)

It has recently been discovered in ancient Sharlayan documents that the gigas believe the Crystal Tower a holy place, and that is the reason why the colossal beings have begun gathering in north Silvertear. This, unfortunately, has made it difficult for the Sons of Saint Coinach to conduct their research, what with the gigas constantly destroying their findings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Among Giants (4259669)

Driven south by the cold weather and lack of prey, many gigas have taken a foothold on the northern shore of Silvertear Lake, much to the chagrin of the Sons of Saint Coinach who are currently in the area studying the ancient ruins and crystalline phenomena.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Another Day, Another Demon (4259698)

That's What Adventurers Are For (4259840)

The Sons of Saint Coinach find themselves in a bind once again, this time thanks to one Dione─a gigas high priest rumored to be older than time itself. The naturalists won't sleep easy until this menace is resting at the bottom of Silvertear Lake.

Home Is Where the Horn Is (4321749)

Hapalits, foul cousins of the ogres, are on the move in search of a new lair, far from the levinbolts of their former abode. The violent creatures have a natural tendency to tear anything moving into two, and so while one might sympathize with their plight to find a new home, it is for the best that they are not allowed to set up camp anywhere nearby.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gone with the Shadow (4309675)

Over the course of the past three nights, three Sons of Saint Coinach have gone missing from their tents. The guards claim they saw nothing but shadows, but perhaps therein lies the answer to this mystery. Let the dark hunt begin!

Book of Pride (4288528)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tempered, Tempered (4288537)

Instead of killing his victims, Ifrit will “temper” them, burning away their wills, rendering them mindless servants to the Lord of the Inferno. As a primal is only as powerful as the number of its followers, returning the souls of the tempered to the Lifestream effectively weakens the demigods.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Full of Rigor Mortis (4288562)

To survive, an iron tortoise must consume three times its weight every sennight.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
9 to 5 (4305219)

After the Calamity devastated much of Eorzea's workforce, Mamool Ja mercenaries were called over from their homeland to do everything from slay aether-crazed monsters to tile rooves. However, now with the return of a much more stable workforce in adventurers, many of the Mamool Ja find themselves out of work...and have turned to banditry to make ends meet.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Closing Time (4305695)

Some creatures crave blood, others treasure. But there is one fiend of the night who craves neither.

Cliff Hanger (4311936)

Cork bulbs will often choose to set their roots deep in the side of cliffs to better protect themselves from hungry predators.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tail of a Whale (4325113)

Instead of killing his victims, the primal Leviathan will “drown” them, erasing their wills and rendering them mindless servants of the Lord of the Whorl.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

By a Whisker (4306089)

The Miner in the Mirror (4306101)

Be Ze─pickman of the 59th Order of kobolds and enemy of miners across La Noscea─is infamous for ruthlessly exploiting mineral deposits of all their resources, leaving them barren for all those who come to O'Ghomoro in search of ore.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Schism (4323906)

Fire in the Hole (4306107)

Drawn by whatever it is that draws voidsent from their midnight realm to this one, a cloud of grenades slowly floats in the direction of Camp Overlook. If it were to arrive at the outpost, the results would be deadly; therefore the cloud must be diverted at once.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Make It Rain (4306118)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Metal Alchemist (4306150)

59th Order Bedesman Bi Go is a skilled alchemist, known for his experimentations on coblyns. His research has led to vast improvements in kobold metallurgical techniques, which, in time, will lead to better kobold weapons, which, ultimately, will lead to more Maelstrom casualties. Locate the holy man and cease his advancements.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Spandy Balidet (4323053)

In their incessant diggings, the kobolds have unearthed something that was better left buried─a living statue of a time long past, awoken from an eternity of slumber to kill once again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
In Spite of It All (4309352)

Deep within the Twelveswood lives a spriggan with a heart blacker than his stygian shock of fur─his name, Spiteful.

The Enmity of My Enemy (4323403)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Below His Station (4309371)

Got Milkroot (4321567)

Milkroot is a curse upon the people of the Twelveswood, destroying lives and tearing apart families. The sylphs who grow the deadly drug must be dealt with, but until they can be found, we must concentrate our efforts on ridding the forest of the saplings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Breaking Dawn (4322736)

Tempered sylphs have prepared a feast for Daxio of the Dawn─a powerful weaver of spells who uses milkroot to conjure visions of the future. The revelry must be stopped lest the sylphs defile the sacred forest and anger the elementals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Handful of Dreams (4309384)

To induce even more powerful visions, tempered sylphs add the excretions of dreamtoads to their milkroot solutions. This blend, however, oft proves too toxic for the unknowing taker, and can lead to coma or even death. Little can be done to stop the production of milkroot, but the fewer toads to gather oil from, the harder it will be for the sylphs to brew the more potent varieties.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bush Blade (4322740)

Everything's Better (4322738)

Masters of poisons, the sylphs utilize all manner of the forest's flora and fauna to create their deadly tinctures. One of those materials is a funguar known as the sylph bonnet for the hood-like shape of the cap. The poison from one cap can sicken an entire army, so it is best that the creatures are disposed of before the beastmen find them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Gale that Rocks the Cradle (4309398)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fate Is a Fecal Mistress (4309426)

Air Supply (4328466)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Twinkle, Twinkle Little Trap (4317702)

A band of spriggans have spoiled this year's egg hunt, stealing all the eggs and the various goodies they hold. Retrieve the eggs, and see that no present is left unopened.

What's Yours Is Mine (4627615)

A band of spriggans have spoiled this year's egg hunt, stealing all the eggs and the various goodies they hold. Retrieve the eggs, and see that no present is left unopened.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eggcelsior (4627623)

You know what they say about spriggans with big eggs: they have big prizes. Now go and get it!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Street Spectral Parade (5032488)

The Continental Circus wants *you* for its splendidly spooky parade. While transfigured, follow the ogre pumpkinhead along Emerald Avenue and cast the Festal Cant charm on the citizens who have come to spectate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloria in Eggcelsis (5840971)

Don your most sable of spriggan suits and crack, crush, shatter, and smash your way into Hatching-tide history. Leave no enormous egg unscrambled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloria in Eggcelsis (4325183)

Don your most sable of spriggan suits and crack, crush, shatter, and smash your way into Hatching-tide history. Leave no enormous egg unscrambled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloria in Eggcelsis (4325194)

Don your most sable of spriggan suits and crack, crush, shatter, and smash your way into Hatching-tide history. Leave no enormous egg unscrambled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloria in Eggcelsis (4325207)

Don your most sable of spriggan suits and crack, crush, shatter, and smash your way into Hatching-tide history. Leave no enormous egg unscrambled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gloria in Eggcelsis (4325231)

Don your most sable of spriggan suits and crack, crush, shatter, and smash your way into Hatching-tide history. Leave no enormous egg unscrambled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wave Good-bye (5894912)

Wavekin in the clouds? It matters not how they arrived, only that they leave─now─before the residents of Moghome find themselves pom-deep in slimy scales and flapping fins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nuts (5896057)

In retrospect, stuffing an archaeosaur's nostrils full of kupo nuts while it slept probably wasn't the best of ideas. So sayeth the mischievous moogle currently fleeing for its life from a pack of bloodthirsty scalekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glycon Air (5896064)

Direct descendant of the vengeful Tioman, Glycon's blood runs as black as that of his progenitor. Slay the dark dragon and grant his troubled soul peace.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coin Toss (5896065)

Some moogles are slaves to fashion, others to fortune. And then there are those who are slaves to both and create their fashion out of other's fortunes─in this case, a necklace made of old coins on a string. Coins collected by you, of course.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Supper Time (5896075)

There is one thing that an archaeosaur enjoys more than feeding, and that is feeding on plump, juicy moogles. Stop the slavering scalekin before they make their way into Moghome.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sprite Club (5896076)

It has been observed that increased activity by lightning-aspected dragons is accompanied by an increase in sprites of the same charge. Slay the sprites and restore aetherial balance to the area.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Whole Food (5896084)

No, that frantic flurry of “kupos” you hear is not your imagination, but the sound of an unlucky moogle swallowed whole by Abelisk─a towering archaeosaur with an insatiable appetite. Help slice open a path to freedom before the big lizard's bile does its work.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Say it Tulihand (5896085)

The Dravanian Horde is gathering forces for an aerial attack on Ishgard proper. Scatter the tulihands as they arrive, putting an end to the assault before it begins.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vouivre Believre (5896088)

Infuriated at the foiling of their plot, the vouivres who called for the tulihand assault on Ishgard's walls have gathered to mete punishment on the meager mortals who would so foolishly stand against the Horde.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Waugyl Waugyl Waugyl (5896089)

Master of the Monsterie, Waugyl the Warring has descended from his perch to prey on those bold, or foolhardy, enough to make the winding journey through the Landlord Colony.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
How to Cane Your Dragon (5896094)

A small band of lesser dragons serving the mighty Nidhogg has begun assailing Zenith in a rather futile attempt to topple the spire and please their ever-wroth master. Show the dragons the glimmer of your steel and drive them off before any grave damage is done.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Aevis Has Left the Building (5896101)

Enraged at seeing their brethren sent back to their lairs with their tails 'twixt their legs, a pack of slightly less witless, yet far more arrogant cloud aevis have come to seek vengeance for pride wounded.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Asah, I Came, I Conquered (5896102)

The road to Asah is already perilous enough without an adamantine monstrosity blocking passage and sucking the marrow from the bones of unfortunate travelers. Slay Cuelebre and ensure that if travelers are to have their marrow sucked, it will not be because of a road-blocking dragon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Waiting for Fjalar to Stall (5896104)

Mistdragon Fjalar, loyal subject to Hraesvelgr, maintains his vigilant watch over Zenith and the Churning Mists as he awaits the return of his lord. There are those, however, who would see Fjalar fail at his task─minions of the hate-driven Nidhogg.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't Know Wyvern (5896106)

Elder wyverns serving the Dravanian Horde have returned to the Churning Mists after completing a deadly assault on Ishgardian settlements in Coerthas. Attack the creatures while their wounds are still fresh, and see that they never return to the lower realm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
From Dusk till Gone (5895521)

One of the final, and most infamous Horde assaults on the Dusk Vigil before the stronghold's eventual fall was the massacre helmed by the merciless wyvern Minaruja. Since that day, the knights of Ishgard have sworn vengeance. Mayhap this is the day it shall be had.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Treehouse of the Spirits (5895533)

Blood spilled in recent battles has soaked the dry soil of the Churning Mists, drawing forth thirstful spirits such as the arboreal meliae. As always, satisfaction will not be found in the amount retrieved, and they will soon turn to attacking the living to wet their tongues.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
As the World Burns (5895543)

As if slaughtering defenseless Ishgardians was not enough, the high dragon Kucedre will go out of his way to defile the most sacred of Ishgardian monuments, so that we may ever be reminded of his power. Slay the unforgivable villain and bring peace to the land once again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
It's the Moogle, Reinvented (5895561)

Bound by ancient covenant entered with Hraesvelgr, the moogles of the Churning Mists will periodically make the journey to Zenith to clean the sacred spire of any defilement done at the hands of Nidhogg's underlings. A recent increase in Horde activity, however, has made the journey impossible without escort.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Corporal Pomishment (5895577)

A thorough scolding by Mogpo the Magnificent was not enough to convince Mogoosh the Misbehaving that his recent run of mischief has put the lives of all Moghome's moogles in peril. Mogpo has asked you to rough up the rascal until he repents.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Infamous (5895754)

The Horde has temporarily turned its vengeful gaze from Ishgard to the few dragons who still maintain their allegiance to Hraesvelgr─Galar of the Second Sun being one such acolyte. Aid the aged dragon in driving back his assailants before he succumbs to the wounds already dealt him.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ain't Misbehaving (5895758)

Mogoosh is back to his misbehaving ways, this time picking on someone his own size, a brood of newborn dragonlings nesting in Zenith. The good moogles of Moghome have tried reasoning with the mischief-maker, but now seek a more...painful form of persuasion.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Metal Gears Rising (5904860)

Rumors of a new “whizzlepop” gear being developed by the diabolical Illuminati have Idyllshire inhabitants worried for their well-being. All they need do now is acquire several whizzlepops from Illuminati members to find out exactly *what* the contraptions are and if there actually *is* any cause for concern.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Metal Gears Revengeance (5908701)

Seeking retribution for whizzlepops fizzled, a party of Illuminati revengers has been dispatched into the Arkhitekton. Slay the gate-crashing goblins and put an end to their virulent vendetta.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Metal Gears Revengeance 2 (5911700)

The old adage that revenge is a dish best served cold unfortunately does not translate well into gobbiespeak, and the Illuminati have deployed a massive magitek vangob, seeking further revenge for the quashing of their first (failed) attempt at revenge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tarantula Hawk, Pro Stinger (5908486)

A lack of tarantulas in the Dravanian hinterlands has tarantula hawks seeking other potential victims to serve as nourishment for their larvae. Exterminate the swarm before they set their compound eyes on puppies or kittens or baby Lalafells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wild Wilde Death (5908562)

What does one do when two breeds of pests known for destroying crops and raiding pens are found fighting each other for territorial dominance? Why, use the opportunity to slay both, what else?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Gets the Red Out (5905401)

Thought to have been bred by a Sharlayan alchemist who was working on an improved recipe for eye drops, Epaphus was abandoned by his master during the exodus which emptied the northwestern city–state, leaving the beast to wreak havoc on the lives of those few who remained.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Makes the Very Best...Nests (5909468)

The absence of bibliothecaries in the Great Gubal Library since the Sharlayans' mass exodus back to their homeland has allowed all manner of vilekin─including the damselfly─to use the remaining tomes as nests. Exterminate the pests so that further damage to the library might be lessened.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Olympus Has Pollen (5909524)

Despite their heavy-duty masks, the good goblins of Idyllshire have recently been plagued with watery eyes and sniffly snouts─the culprit believed to be the pollen of the narbroois. Until the beastmen can retool their masks to filter this irksome irritant, a bounty has been placed on the seedkin's heads.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Feed Me, See More (5907761)

While most of Eorzea's carnivorous plants are immobile, limiting the danger they pose to other creatures, narbroois are not bound to the soil, making them possible threats to the realm's inhabitants─Ruginis being the biggest...and hungriest threat of all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pop Goes the Whizzle (5911808)

After failing to revenge the failed attempt at revenging the theft of their whizzlepops, the Illuminati have given up on revenge and simply decided that if they can't have the items, no one can, sending a small army to destroy them. Help the goblins of Idyllshire protect the whizzlepops, if only to simply spite the Illuminati.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Revenge of the Vengeful Revengeance (5909566)

Unable to exact revenge, exact revenge for an inability to exact revenge, or destroy crates because of an inability to exact revenge for an inability to exact revenge, the Illuminati have dispatched the highly decorated Moundrinx Eightclinks in a last-ditch effort to prove they are not nearly as incompetent as everyone now thinks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ratel and Hum (5909734)

Drawn to the waste piles of Bigwest Shortstop, a pack of diseased ratels has descended from the surrounding mountains to feed. As even a single bite will bring on a dread fever, it is crucial that the beasts be put down swiftly and without mercy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dobharch Did It for the Best (5905743)

Drawn to the dying screams of her children, Dobharch─ratel matron─has come seeking payment in blood for the lives lost in the previous day's culling.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Infant Vangob (5910905)

Trouble with the jangletype vangob (namely that its jangling would give away its position to the enemy) has prompted the Illuminati to develop a new model of vangob─the espertype, supposedly capable of anticipating the movements of its targets. Destroy the prototypes before the goblins can begin mass production.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Morbol Man (5917889)

Seedlings forgotten in Saint Mocianne's Arboretum have since grown into ferocious great morbols. If that was not enough, southerlies off Mount Gubal carry the stench from their maws directly into Idyllshire where the unmasked residents are doomed to suffer until the winds change...or kind adventurers lend a helping hand.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
On Melancholic Hill (5907737)

What tragic event brought unbalance to poor Moira's humours, resulting in an excess of black bile is unknown. What *is* known is that the overgrown morbol has already devoured three goblins, four Lalafells, and a rolanberry cake baked to celebrate the nameday of Idyllshire's oldest resident. The seedkin must be stopped before any more pastry is lost.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Bear, Sun Bear, What Do You Eat (5918043)

It is said that once a sun bear acquires a taste for the flesh of man, it will eat nothing else. Two missing Miqo'te lovers who were last seen in the Answering Quarter─an area now overrun with violent sun bears─suggest that taste has already been acquired.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bear Up There (5918148)

Dravanian folklore tells of a mighty Hellsguard forty hands tall who wrestled with Dubhe─the deadliest sun bear on all Abalathia's Spine. Nothing more is mentioned of the Roegadyn, but Dubhe still terrorizes the land today.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Birds and the Bears (5918173)

Sun bears will often raid the nests of cockatrices looking for eggs to crack open and devour. This practice, obviously, is not looked kindly upon by mother cockatrices who will furiously defend their broods to the death. Bears weakened from cockatrice attacks, however, make easy prey for adventurers looking to earn a little extra coin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Poroggo Stuck (5912740)

Sent on an errand by her master to fetch eye of newt and toe of frog, Maro Roggo finds herself unable to return with the items, for the road home is now bristling with blood-lusting beasts. Escort the poor poroggo safely back to her master and receive a hefty reward.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog Days of Summer (5907648)

When abandoning their Eorzean settlement, the Sharlayans left more than their tomes and their tuffets, they left their poroggo familiars, who now, after waiting patiently for their masters to return home, have decided it is time to release nigh on twenty summers of pent-up rage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Toss 'Em Back (5906868)

A school of migrating opken have infested the waters of the Dravanian hinterlands, eating anything and everything the wavekin can fit their maws about, including fish harvested by the goblins of Idyllshire. Seek out the scaled abominations and send them back to the sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tome Raider (5918869)

On his way back home from the Great Gubal Library, a school of opken attacked young Browfix Turnalot, ripping from his grasp the ancient folios he had collected from the abandoned house of tomes. Browfix seeks assistance in retrieving what he rightfully stole.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cockatrice Block (5913233)

Several domesticated cockatrices have escaped from their coop and taken up residence in the Great Gubal Library, tearing apart priceless tomes to create makeshift nests atop guano-striped bookshelves. The cloudkin will, however, emerge to hunt, offering a rare opportunity for capture.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Come Shells or High Water (5913192)

Without any natural predators in the Dravanian hinterlands, the population of bifericeras introduced to the area by goblins for harvesting has increased exponentially. The residents of Idyllshire are seeking brave men and women to cull their numbers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Toad Alone (5907490)

Poor Bero Roggo is just one of many poroggo familiars abandoned by their masters when the Sharlayan exodus took place. Bero, however, never forgot the pain of waking up alone, and has since sworn revenge on anyone who even reminds him of his former life.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
How Do You Feed a Hungry Manlike Monster (5906925)

A remarkably ravenous breed of opken, the oplo opken will devour upwards of a hundred fish a day to fill their seemingly bottomless bellies, moving on once an area has been gutted. Though they appear manlike, the opken are more monster than man─the end of a blade the only reason they will heed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of the Woodwork (5906080)

Crawlers have infested Saint Mocianne's Arboretum and are transforming the entire building into a giant cocoon from which more crawlers will eventually emerge. Squash the vilekin...and don't forget to wipe your buskins on the grass.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Silkworm (5906043)

The cyclopean crawler Habetrot is a weaver most wicked, and will spin his silk about anything that moves, including his own kin. It is high time the vilekin's threads were snapped.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye in the Sky (5917399)

Many of the knights stationed in the Coerthas western highlands to watch the skies for Horde activity complain of a constant feeling of being watched themselves...by giant furry eyes nonetheless. Search the area for the peeping prowlers and provide them with a slightly more permanent form of “shut-eye.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Dung Deal (5917854)

A noblewoman who recently visited the Pike and Anvil lodged a formal complaint with the Falcon's Nest garrison commander, threatening to strip him of his land and titles after stepping in a rather ripe pile of dung left by the steinbocks which graze in the area. The message is clear─either the beasts go, or he goes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Land of the Freeze (5941184)

Ice sprites blown off the windswept Gorgagne Holding and into Camp Riversmeet are freezing all the outpost's drinking water. Slay the spirits and ensure thirsts stay slaked.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn of the Mylodons (5919840)

Upland mylodons have lumbered their way atop the Black Iron Bridge to bathe in the short winter sun, and refuse to budge, impeding the progress of supply wains going to and from Falcon's Nest. Drive the beasts back so that the deliveries might recommence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Don of the Mylodons (5920035)

Displeased by their violent displacement from the sunbaked stones of the Black Iron Bridge, the upland mylodons have lumbered back, this time accompanied by their great elder, Peluda.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
We Fought a Dzu (5911961)

Numerous are the legends that tell of Dzu-Teh─a yeti as tall as the Craving Tree and as fast as the Swiftrun River. With a temper as hot as the waters of Dragonspit and a heart as cold as rime-locked Ashpool. With hair as white as the flour once ground at Gorgagne Mills and... In other words, he must needs be slain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
True Convictions (5915086)

Ever yammering about how they seek the glory one might obtain by slaying a dragon, the moment a few archaeornis descend on their camp, the Convictors turn pleading eyes to nearby adventurers, seeking assistance in escaping the day with their lives...and to a lesser extent, their dignities.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Polar Express (5912658)

Food is scarce in the snow-covered north, so when Ishgardian knights bring in large quantities of rations to outfit their camps, it is only a matter of time before all manner of hungry creatures descend from the mountains looking for a bite. Drive away the beasts to keep the knights' bellies full.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Apparent Trap (5917368)

While the name “yetitrap” implies that the seedkin is physically capable of actually trapping a full-grown yeti, it is highly unlikely that even a Lalafell's forearm would fit in the plant's mouth. That does not mean, however, that they should be left to roam free nipping at Lalafellin limbs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abominable Me (5912739)

On especially cold nights, yetis from the Slate Mountains will journey down to Dragonspit to find warmth in the thermal pools. On their way back, they will oft raid nearby farms, stealing livestock and the occasional child, whom they keep alive until back in their dens so they may drink the blood hot.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Requiem for a Dragon (5915017)

Ever since its exposure following the Calamity, the ice encasing the Dreaming Dragon of Ashpool has been slowly melting, releasing into the nearby air the fetid stench of rotting dragon flesh─a stench that is now driving local fauna into a frenzy. Slay the slavering wooly yaks and polar bears drawn to the dragon before they set their sights on you.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Follow the Sleet (5926098)

The endless winter brought by the Calamity has rendered the once-lush Gorgagne Holding a frozen wasteland where naught but man-eating sleet traps thrive. But, as the saying goes, an empty wasteland is better than one teeming with deadly seedkin, so take up your swords and slice away.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sick Pack (5913094)

When the climate in the highlands changed, once fiercely independent wolf packs began doing the unthinkable─combining, forming super packs so as to increase chances of survival in their new harsh environment. These super packs now pose a serious threat to the knights stationed in the area, and assistance is sought in controlling their numbers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
In Command (5913009)

If anything is worse than being maimed by an ice commander, it is being buried alive in an avalanche caused by an ice commander and wishing in the final moments before suffocation that you had instead been maimed by an ice commander. Rid the area of ice commanders, and alleviate the need to worry about either.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
What You See Is What You Get (5917389)

It is said that when gazing into the eye of the Beholder, a man can see his deepest desires─those desires usually involving escape from the iron grip of the Beholder's wicked claws.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Panic Rheum (5926102)

A voidsent by any other name would still be as unsweet as the deceptively sweet-sounding gelato. Case in point, the rheum (though its name is not very sweet-sounding to begin with). In addition to not being very sweet, both are also very deadly, and if the first is not reason enough to cull their numbers, the second definitely is.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sugar, Sugar (5926108)

One can tell how well fed an area's residents are by listening to the names given to everyday creatures─playful monikers such as Tartufo and White Truffle suggesting that starvation-induced delirium is causing everything to resemble food. Unable to fight on empty stomachs, the people of Coerthas seek a better-nourished hero to save them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsilent Vigil (5913045)

Several archaeornis have flown over Lancegate and begun gathering near the Dusk Vigil. Fearing an attack by the Dravanian Horde near, the knights in the area have put a call out to adventurers requesting assistance in dispersing the flock.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pico de Gallows (5915728)

While swift adventurer action has left the archaeornis flock in a state of disarray, the effort may have come too late, as scouts now report the arrival of Picolaton─a terrifying creature known to lay waste to entire companies of knights without suffering more than a few ruffled feathers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run, Riders, Run (5916042)

Outriders belonging to House Durendaire have been spotted fleeing from a pack of silver wolves which, despite losing over half of its number to the knights' steel, remains in pursuit, knowing the knights cannot run forever. Hurry to the outriders' aid before their legs fail them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
One Whiskey, One Goat, One Spear (5917397)

After stumbling upon a barrel of whiskey stored outside one of the Convictors' tents, Heidrun became one of the happiest mountain goats in Coerthas. Once the whiskey had disappeared, however, he transformed into one of the angriest, destroying large stocks of supplies in a futile search for another sip.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
No Ifs, Ands, or Butts (5918414)

Newly knighted Alaimbert of the Spiked Butt cannot understand why people are always laughing behind his back, so to prove he is worthy of their respect, he seeks a battle-hardened opponent with whom he may cross steel.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Null and Void (5919006)

Summoned eons ago and then forgotten, bergthurs are voidsent trapped in a realm not their own, determined to tear their way back to the void even if it means destroying this world in the process.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dishonored (5920774)

Ser Werner and Ser Beaudonet of the Convictors have come to an impasse regarding who dealt the killing blow to a dragon (pup) that wandered into their camp (with a broken leg). Unwilling to even agree to disagree, Ser Werner has dishonored the Convictors and must be punished.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
By the Horns (5925602)

From the day he is born, a chocobo hunter dreams of capturing an elusive bull chocobo. Fortunately, bull chocobos are abundant enough to provide all with the opportunity to fulfill this dream...whether it be yours or not.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ladies First (5925604)

A band of chocobo hunters banished from Tailfeather for trapping only female chocobos has been spotted near the Chocobo Forest doing what they do best. See that their next banishment is from the realm of the living.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run, Run Away (5925605)

Swift legs and sharp beaks all but ensure that chocobos can survive the dangers of the Dravanian forelands. Some creatures, however, are simply too much for the majestic cloudkin, Yowie being one such terror.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Birds of a Feather (5925615)

It takes a feather to catch a feather, or so say the hunters of Tailfeather who use the fallen plumes of wild chocobos to fletch their arrows. A fair sum will be paid for any feathers delivered, but beware of bandersnatches lurking in the bushes!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Glawackus On, Glawackus Off (5925621)

Glawackus─a bandersnatch so greedy it was set upon by its own pack─now wanders the forelands alone, devouring anything it can wrap its claws around...which is most often chocobo hatchlings. Hunt down the beast and slay it once and for all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bear Apparent (5925624)

Brown bears are eating all the salmon returning upriver to spawn before they can lay their eggs. If this continues, there will be a shortage of harvestable wavekin next season. Bloody the bears' noses so that they might seek sustenance elsewhere.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Who's the Moss (5925625)

If only poor Mossy Peak had the power to attract Roegadyn maids the way he attracts feather fleas. But he doesn't, and so his only company remains scores of bloodsucking vilekin who, if not dealt with quickly, will suck Mossy Peak dry before he can arrive home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rite Stuff (5925628)

Crazed heretics who have forsaken Halone's guidance to befoul their bodies with the blood of the enemy have made a pilgrimage to Mare's Oath─to no doubt perform some horrible pagan rite. Find the mangled creatures, and send their souls to the Fury for final judgment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Meat (5925636)

Exiled from the Gnath after losing their ties to the Onemind, the Vath must fare for themselves if they are to survive, and if that means looking to an adventurer for aid in slaying loaghtans, they are not too proud to ask.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Whole Truth (5925638)

A band of heretics led by the overzealous Huibairten has gathered near Tailfeather, their sights set on the lightly defended hamlet and its bounteous stores of provisions. Slay the wild-eyed men and women before their leader arrives and the assault is commenced.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing but the Truth (5925640)

Huibairten is overtaken with madness upon seeing the bodies of his loyal servants strewn across the forest floor. The anger sends his tainted blood a-boiling, hastening his transformation into the beast which now looms before you. Slay the heretic before he sees Tailfeather burn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Drone Under (5925641)

Ever looking to expand the Onemind, the Gnath have sent forth a small parade of drones to seek out and claim new lands. Engage the beastmen and hold the line until the enemy sounds the retreat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
El Miacid (5925644)

A Vath hates three things, and two of them involve the pesky miacid. Aid the Nonmind in clearing the area of the beastkin and alleviate approximately sixty-seven percent of their worries.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cerf's Up (5925647)

Not quite a hippogryph and technically not a griffin, the hippocerf is the awkward little cousin in the lion-eagle hybrid family. Ever trying to prove their worth, they engage in reckless behavior that, while oft simply annoying, will sometimes prove deadly, especially when that behavior involves fragile dragon eggs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Elephant in the Brume (5925648)

Many a wall in Ishgard's Brume still bear the scars of Svarog's numerous assaults on the city–state proper, as do many a heart of those who have lost kin to the fell wyrm's flames. It is time the deeds were repaid.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Migas Touch (5925650)

Returning from the hunt to find half her clutch being slurped down by a party of hungry Vath has sent nanka matron Migas into a frenzy, and now she threatens to lay waste to all of Loth ast Vath. Assist the Nonmind in pacifying the pond-dweller.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hearing Voices (5925653)

Scholars claim that the voice of a dragon somehow manipulates the wind aether upon which it is carried─the aether providing the voice with added potency which, in turn, extends range and authority. Heightened vinegaroon activity in the forelands is believed to be in direct correlation with this phenomenon.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mourning After (5925654)

The half-man, half-dragon abomination Bloodbearer Robairlain has laid claim to the sacred cavern known as Mourn, slaying several of its peaceful guardians in the process. The Horde and its mindless minions cannot be allowed a foothold so near Ishgardian territories. Find this heretic and expel him from Sohm Al.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stamp the Yard (5925659)

Driven from their territory by Horde dragons, a herd of gallimimuses has begun to stampede. If allowed to reach the forelands' lower elevations, they will most certainly flatten all in their path, from newly planted crops to unsuspecting children. Head off the heated creatures and attempt to slow the rampage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Come to My Arms (5925663)

A pack of peaceful bandersnatches have begun to clash with several thunder dragons over control of a watering hole. Use the confusion as an opportunity to slay the dragons and calm the bloody waters.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Tarasque Force (5925665)

While rare, the dragon Tarasque will occasionally descend from the Churning Mists to foul the weak minds of heretics seeking truth in the words of the enemy. This opportunity to slay the master manipulator cannot be allowed to slip through our fingers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mint Condition (5926386)

To stave off the myriad vilekin that endlessly nip at the cheeks of the Rose Knights stationed in Cloudtop, several crates filled with seedlings of a natural herb repellent known as catmint were brought in to plant around the camp. Unfortunately, the odor has attracted a clowder of gaelicats who have begun destroying the containers to get at their contents.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Saved the Nests for Last (5926388)

The belly of a gastornis is filled with one of the most powerful corrosives known to man, allowing the massive cloudkin to digest almost anything from bones and hair, to crystal and rock. This digestive process produces toxic fumes which are released as the gastornis breathes, making them deadly neighbors...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
One Turned Over the Cloudkin's Nest (5926389)

If you believed that destroying a giant nest would not upset the giant creature who called that nest home, then Diatryma would like to have a word with you.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Food Fight (5926390)

Food is scarce on the floating islets of the Sea of Clouds, so when two species descend on the same hunting grounds, chaos is bound to erupt. That chaos, however, can be a blessing in disguise by providing an opportunity to kill two birds (or more accurately one bird and one rodent-like creature) with one stone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leech the Sky (5926391)

Not a soul in the realm would deny that a good leeching now and again keeps the humours clean and the body free of sickness, but pumpkin-sized leeches capable of rendering a man into a husk in a matter of moments? That is a different story altogether.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzu Trois (5926392)

Once anzu hatchlings reach a certain age, their mothers will begin taking them hunting so that the hatchlings can learn the art of subduing prey. Slay the birds, both young and old, to prevent the fostering of new killers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Youth Must Be Severed (5926393)

As a display of strength, young members of the Gundu tribe will taunt their enemies using petty acts of aggression such as shouting insults or throwing feces. Those especially brave and arrogant, however, will actually physically attack, and without someone to bloody their noses, the violence can only escalate.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Long Way Down (5926394)

The paissas are a mischievous bunch, finding amusement in cracking open Rose Knight crates and tossing their contents off Cloudtop to the ground thousands of yalms below. The worst offender─a deceptively adorable misfit named Apotamkin─has been sighted, and the order is out to show him the same fate as the crates.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
This Is How We Gundu (5926395)

Armed warriors of the hostile Gundu tribe have gathered before Vundu Ok' Bendu and begun the ritual hooting of insults and stomping of talons which normally serve as a prelude to battle. Rather than wait for the Vanu to attack, the Rose Knights have elected to cast the first stone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Come to My Window (5926399)

One too many puffs on the morrowmote pipe put the Zundu tribe wamourakeeper's mind so at ease that he forgot to lock the gate to the silk pens before retiring to bed. When he woke the next morning to the chaos inflicted by the escaped moths, he wondered why the morrowmotes did not provide him with visions of *this* particular future.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Obey their Thirst (5926400)

The Zundu tribe discovered long ago that the hearts of cloud sprites are crystals which, when shattered, expel large amounts of clean, drinkable water─a resource quite scarce on their floating islets. The problem is removing the hearts from their owners who, annoyingly enough, require them to live.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fugitive (5926401)

A young member of the Zundu tribe, kidnapped and forced to serve as a footrest for a Vundu elder, has escaped his captors and is trying to return home. The elder, displeased that his favorite footrest has flown the coop, has gathered a small army to search every cookhouse, birdhouse, and outhouse in order to reclaim what he rightfully abducted.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Zuns on the Run (5926402)

The warrior who kindly agreed to escort the former footrest back to the Zundu village has turned out to be a gaelicat's-paw of the Vundu elder who kidnapped the young Zundu. It appears that boy will require further escort if he is ever to arrive home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
On Dangerous Ground (5926403)

After centuries of protecting the land, one groundskeeper had enough and began devouring the very stuff he was tasked with defending. Decommission the groundseater before there are no islets left in the sky.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leather and Mace (5926404)

Tanning techniques are relatively unknown to the Vanu Vanu, making treated leather a rare commodity in the Sea of Clouds. Rather than learn to make their own, some of the tribes would instead forcefully take it from the area's new arrivals clad head to toe in the protective wear.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hearts Like Steel, Fists Like Thunder (5926405)

Soldiers of the VIth Imperial Legion have engaged with the Vundu tribe. Allow the two sides to weaken each other, then sneak in and claim the heads of both.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bones (5926408)

Though average Vanu lifespans would suggest she is not a day over thirty summers, members of the Zundu claim that Vundu warrioress Oonu Vali has been collecting the bones of her victims and adding them to her feathers since the dawn of time.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bismarcking Time (5926409)

Vundu high priest Kena Vanu has begun a forbidden rite which, if allowed to continue, will summon forth the very Lord of the Mists, Bismarck. Slay the beastman and prevent certain tragedy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Let There Be Acolytes (5926410)

Acolytes of the temporarily dispatched Kena Vanu have sworn revenge on the featherless netherlings who silenced their master before he could finish teaching them all seventy-three mysteries of the skies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Disturbing Lack of Faith (5926411)

It appears Kena Vanu was not as thoroughly dispatched as originally believed, and the high priest has returned, not with the Lord of the Mists, but with a creature almost as imposing at his side. Ware the impaling talons of the dread Skvader and slay the beastman who summoned him.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guano a Mano (5926412)

Nothing is worse than finding yourself underneath a flock of toco tocos as they relieve themselves of their recent meals...until you realize that toco toco guano is highly corrosive and can burn your flesh down to the bone. Disperse the converging cloudkin before they carpet bomb the entire area with their fetid feces.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sound of Madness (5926413)

Vanu tribes claim that the shrill mating call of Podarge, a fearsome cloudkin who inhabits the Sea of Clouds, can drive men to madness─the most severely affected throwing themselves off islands simply to escape the terrible sound. Silence the creature before your own sanity is lost.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
You Eat What You Aren't (5926414)

The diet of a griffin is believed to consist mostly of the flesh of small- to medium-sized mountain creatures such as goats and gaelicats. The hulking Akhekhu, however, will only sup on fully grown Vanu Vanu, making the cloudkin both hated and feared by the islet tribes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Dream, Perchance to Eat (5926415)

Some Vanu Vanu tribes believe that one's soul leaves the body every night to journey to the realm of dreams. It is also believed that cloudkin known as tsanahales will perch atop village huts in an attempt to devour these souls, making the creatures hated across the Sea of Clouds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkscale Descendeth (5920108)

Vowing to see Zenith suffer no more at the ravaging claws of the Horde, Hraesvelgr has summoned the mighty Vedrfolnir to do his bidding. Join the white dragon in defending the ancient spire from Darkscale─one of Nidhogg's most fearsome generals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkscale Disappeareth (5922602)

Both body and pride wounded, Darkscale has ordered his three captains to guard his retreat from Zenith. Focus your efforts on the minions before the healing properties of the general's dragon blood see him to a full recovery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Darkscale Devoureth (5923504)

Tapping into the aetherial energy of a nearby crystal deposit has filled Darkscale with newfound strength. Engage the unyielding dragon in one last battle to the death.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vedrfolnir Devoteth (5923891)

Thoroughly impressed with your valor in the slaying of Darkscale, Vedrfolnir has granted you a boon─the honor of matching strength on the field of battle with the white dragon himself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
End of the Rainbow (5926116)

It appears curiosity is not only suited for killing cats, but dragon pups as well. An ill-advised adventure far from his den has placed Rhei End in the face of imminent danger. Hurry to the pup in peril and see that his inquisitive nature is not the end of him.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rastaban Vibration (5926370)

Led by Darkscale's trusted Captain Rastaban, a sizable knot of dragons has begun advancing towards Zenith. Slay Rastaban's minions and put an end to the assault before it can begin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mogicide (5926372)

Another of Darkscale's captains has launched an assault on Zenith, but instead of focusing his attacks on the spire itself, the dragon seeks to slaughter Zenith's moogle caretakers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rebel Yehl (5941797)

Incensed by the recent influx of free company airships into its territory, the savage cloudkin Yehl has declared a one-bird war on any and all denizens of the lower realm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prey Online (5920004)

After five millennia offline, Proto Ultima has restored auxiliary power and begun a full systems check. To recharge its main power cells, the Allagan killing machine has deployed several aether collectors guarded by some of the most frightening of the fallen empire's godless creations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Bug's Death (5925693)

Several verification nodes have identified a unit of malfunctioning clockwork engineers and are requesting assistance in the deactivation of the faulty machina.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Late Escape (5925700)

A slither of self-aware lamiae are attempting an escape from Azys Lla. If the biologically engineered warriors were able to reach Eorzea, the realm would run red with the blood of their victims. Stop the lamiae before they can reach Helix.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Still Ticking (5925725)

Unauthorized personnel (you!) have been detected in the Alpha Quadrant and a clockwork defragmentation unit has been deployed to neutralize the threat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Life of Brain (5925704)

Thousands of years of uncontrolled reproduction and mutation have seen one chimera's cranial capacity nearly double, resulting in a creature too clever...and deadly for its own good. Slay the chimera brain, and end its line.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Monster Mass (5925705)

Ages of neglect have taken their toll on the functionality of the equipment housed in the Biomass Incubation Complex. A malfunction has caused the machines to awaken and begin the mass regeneration of empuses─hideous creatures engineered to kill.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pet, Smart (5925721)

A favorite pet of Emperor Xande, the artificially cloned voidsent Muchalinda has been out of temper since the death of her master, and now believes she knows upon who she might place the blame.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Root of Evil (5925982)

Water is a scarce resource on the corrupted islands of Azys Lla. To survive, the few plants which grow in the area must extend their roots to any sort of moisture available...even if that includes the chemically enriched incubation fluid in which chimeras are grown.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mystery Machine (5925729)

In an attempt to bypass Allagan security, the VIth Imperial Legion has off-loaded a small army of magitek vanguards L-1 from their dreadnaught and deployed them throughout the Gamma Quadrant. While their main targets are clockwork sentries, the machina could pose a deterrent for the allies of Eorzea. Deactivate the machina and cast the rubble to the lands below.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rampant Speculation (5925736)

Imperial speculators are scouring the Gamma Quadrant for military technology that they may take back to Garlemald and incorporate into their armies. Stop the imperials before they can report to the *Gration*.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Put the Knives Down (5925805)

When not used to tear enemies of the Empire limb from limb, adamantite claws are often employed at construction sites for digging holes, demolishing old buildings, and lifting objects. Here, they seem intent on tearing you limb from limb.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scared Sylla (5925806)

Senior magitek technician Sylla mal Albinus has arrived from Garlemald to conduct his inspection of the location chosen for the construction of Castrum Solus. Act quickly, for a similar chance to apprehend the high-ranking imperial official may not present itself again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Phi Slamma Gamma East (5925816)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yak It Up (5925831)

The Allagan Empire is infamous for its wanton manipulation of the gods' creations─the Meracydian brobinyak being only one of many examples. Put these pitiful creatures out of their misery and restore nature's equilibrium.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
No Greater Goryshche (5925833)

Even the mighty dragons themselves were subject to the Allagan Empire's incessant tinkering with the very laws of nature─Goryshche is one such product of that imperial hubris. Aimlessly roaming the Azys Lla wastes, the multi-headed abomination silently seeks an end to five thousand years of suffering.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Harvest Moon (5925846)

An alarum blares from some unknown source, accompanied by the following message: “Administrative node malfunction! Unit deployment error. Automatic recall failed. Removal request submitted. Authorization code 5670-2H5BB-Q90. Repeat. Administrative node malfunction...”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Out of Sight, Out of Mind (5925859)

Data retrieved from tomestones discovered in the Delta Quadrant provide proof that the chimerical failure code-named Stheno was one of the reasons the quarantine block was originally constructed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Room without Books (5925869)

Extensive manipulation of not only the body, but the mind, has left most of the Allagans' creations soulless horrors who only act upon instinct. The Meracydian amphiptere will simply kill without thought as to why it does so, death being the only cure to its disease.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Curiously Strong Things (5925984)

While it is unclear how they were utilized in battle, it is clear from their muscular build and violent disposition that reptoids were designed for one purpose, and one purpose only─killing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Do Spinners Dream of Electric Rooks (5925988)

Severed communication with spinner-rooks under its administrative control has prompted the emergence of the spinner-rick to assess the problem. Destroy the node and deal a blow to the quadrant's rook activity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Long Live the Coeurl (5926380)

The queen of the coeurls has declared war on Tailfeather and leads an assault on the settlement and its inhabitants. Confront Her Majesty and deliver the kiss of regicide.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coeurls Chase Boys (5926381)

It appears Coeurlregina's first attack on Tailfeather was naught more than a calculated feint to gauge the collective strength of those defending the hamlet. Now privy to the settlement's weaknesses, she returns with her army's true strength.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coeurls Chase Boys (5926382)

It appears Coeurlregina's first attack on Tailfeather was naught more than a calculated feint to gauge the collective strength of those defending the hamlet. Now privy to the settlement's weaknesses, she returns with her army's true strength.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coeurls Chase Boys Chase Coeurls (5926383)

Her main offensive a tactical failure, Coeurlregina has sounded the retreat. However, if allowed the luxury of escape, it will only be a matter of time before the wicked beast is conspiring another assault. Make chase, and end the queen's reign here and now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sphenopalatine Ganglioneuralgia (5941338)

The change in climate experienced by Coerthas after the fall of Dalamud has done more than freeze rivers and prevent the growth of foliage─it has made the region more hospitable for a myriad of terrible creatures normally only found dwelling atop the highest of mountains─creatures that have proven naught but headaches for the residents of the western highlands.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Stihi Situation (5941344)

There are very few dragons the Convictors do not dream of slaying─the cold and calculating Stihi being no exception. The knights, however, while skilled at dreaming, have been less than successful at actually subduing the creature...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ware the Maiden Fair (5941717)

Once a beautiful young Elezen with skin like snow and hair like an autumn sun, the dragon maiden was driven to sip the blood of the Horde after being set upon by a pair of highborn knights (who were subsequently tried and hung for their crimes). Since then, she has grown into one of the most ruthless of all wyrm-blooded heretics, attacking even innocent children. Deliver the maiden from this world and give her soul peace once again.

The Sarong Song (5852341)

Faires attract all sorts, and one Mamool Ja has been so incensed by the sights and sounds that he insists on showing the dance of his people, which would make even the most ribald pirate blush. Drive the overeager Mamool Ja away and protect the sensibilities of the beach's faire-goers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
It Came from Beneath the Deep (6043538)

Certain beasts, when properly trained, can provide endless entertainment to spectators, but when they start running amok─as this one has─they must needs be put down. Slay the trained Thing from the Deep before it harms any innocent onlookers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Life's a Beach (6056722)

Two faire-goers wishing to enjoy the fireworks in peace are being accosted by a group of insistent pirates. Teach the pirates to respect the wishes of others, and be prepared if they decide not to listen.

In Deep Water (6383129)

Bombards have begun creeping ashore and must be prevented from moving any further inland. While the Go Go Posing Rangers─heroes tasked with ridding the realm of the Bombard King and his minions─see to some last-minute preparations, their allies must rise to the occasion.

Trial by Fire (6383129)

The Go Go Posing Rangers have arrived but there is no end to the battalion of burgeoning Bombards summoned by their king and for every one of the flaming voidsent extinguished, another pops up in its place. Keep the Rangers out of harm's way by blasting the tiny fiends with elbst water.

Not content with the paltry pickings his retainer was retrieving from ventures into the Black Shroud, a well-to-do noble recently ordered his humble hireling to the Diadem, forbidding the retainer's return until “treasure worthy of a king” was discovered. All the poor soul discovered, however, was a den of starving sky creatures, and now requires aid in escape.

Prepare for Gory (6724730)

Drawn to the Diadem by the islands' extreme concentrations of ambient aether, the carnivorous kerkes strikes fear into all who lay eyes upon it─the kerkes, whose wingspan is so large, its feathers blot out the sun. So prepare to fight in the shade.

Slaughter of the Lost Legend (6718241)

From out of the morning mist emerge harmless baby brachiosaurs─gentle, well-tempered, kind...yet, allowed to mature to full size and these innocent infants *could* claim the lives of countless. How exactly that might happen remains to be seen, but orders are orders.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Embrace of the Serpent (6718431)

Once again, a band of wide-eyed adventurers have bitten off slightly more than they can chew by attempting to capture a basilosaurus─a silver-scaled serpent that can grow to over two score fulms in length from fiery forked tongue to tail.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pelican Grief (6724695)

To subdue their prey, crown pelicans expel from their beaks a fine mist containing a powerful toxin capable of lithifying flesh. The problem is, much of this discharge is carried off by the wind before striking the intended victim, to eventually land on innocent bystanders living in the lands below.

Late Night Torama Queen (6718333)

When the sun falls on the Diadem, the islands' royalty comes out to revel 'neath the swollen moon. Said reveling may include the ransacking of expedition base camps, the destruction of airship rigging, and the devouring of leaden-legged adventurers.

Crawllateral Damage (6719618)

Scholars have determined that cloud crawlers are able to grow to sizes far exceeding that of their terra firma cousins in part due to killer ants which, in their pursuit of the sweet nectar excreted from the crawlers' pores, end up serving as a defense against predators.

Countless sky pirates claim that during their travels through the Sea of Clouds, they have, at one time or another, witnessed a massive bird attempting to devour a rainbow from the very heavens.

How I Met Your Marid (6719515)

Marids are not known for being nocturnal creatures...yet one of the largest ever observed─Iriz Ima─prefers to feed under cover of night. Its eyes, however, are not suited for seeing in the dark, meaning these evening strolls oft end in the untimely flattening of countless animals, minerals, and Lalafells.

Root of the Problem (6720223)

A scavenger, the Bariaua feeds solely on carrion, setting down its roots into corpses and draining them of their remaining humours. What makes this voracious seedkin different is that when hungry, it will not wait to come across a fallen creature, opting rather to slay its own prey in the most violent of fashions.

A gods-fearing, mother-loving, goodly sky pirate has fallen from the rigging of his crew's airship. While fate deemed it not his time, and saw him land safely upon a tuft of crownbrush, fortune was not as impressed and made certain that tuft was located right in the middle of one of the Diadem's most deadly isles. Needless to say, the plucky picaroon might require some assistance.

Any Which Way (6778261)

Not all gigantopithecus will hunt in large packs, some choosing to take to the starlit isles of the Diadem in bands of two or three. The clydopithecus (or “clydes”) are one such species, but do not let their adorable name fool you. These beasts are natural-born killers who would tear the heart out of their own mother's breast and gnaw at its sinewy flesh while the life slowly faded from her eyes...if most had not already done so.

Hard of Heren (6719515)

Having lived for a thousand years encountering neither Lalafell nor Hyur, the Diadem's herensugues no longer fear mankind and his weapons of war. In their ignorance have they grown bold, leading to many attacks on newly arrived explorers to the islands. It is time they are reintroduced to the pain that kept their ancestors at bay.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Battle Toads (6720276)

The relatively small size of each islet in the Diadem can make foraging quite a challenge for the region's wingless inhabitants. It takes the arrival of but a single welkinix, however, to render that challenge an impossibility. Slay the hungry toads before they see the rest of the fauna starve.

Bounty Hunter (6718423)

Its recent grounding at the hands of high winds is not the first time the infamous pirate vessel, the *Bounty*, has been stranded on a Diadem islet.

Where's the Beef (6718352)

A pair of adventurers tired of nibbling on stale tack and moldy cheese have followed their empty bellies to remote wisent grazing grounds, intent on bagging a stray bovine or three to roast over the night's bonfire. What they did not expect was one of the herd to (naturally) take offense.

Can You Smell the Blood Tonight (6719101)

Many summers following the murder of their father─king, nay, *emperor* of the Diadem─at the paws of their cruel uncle, a pride of cloud lions has returned from exile to reclaim their rightful throne. Unfortunately, their approach thus far has been limited to the indiscriminate slaughter of any and all other wildlife on their homeland isle.

Lunantishee in the Sky (6659906)

Extreme levels of ambient aether can not only lead to the increased size and ferocity of a creature, but also to enhanced fertility. Case in point: the Diadem currently finds itself overrun with lunantishee seedlings who, if not dealt with swiftly, will grow into a veritable army of bloodsucking shrubbery.

Excitable Boys (6718291)

Aether emitted by unstable elemental crystals is sending even the most docile of creatures into uncontrollable fits of madness. The condition appears to be irreversible, with a swift end the only means of granting these poor souls mercy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Wings (6888398)

For centuries, the pegasi lived in relative peace amongst the forgotten isles of the Diadem. Humanity's recent return to the skies, however, has seen the majestic creatures once again made a target. A few defiant denizens such as the bejeweled pegasus are fighting back, but their indiscriminate rampages are now causing more harm than good.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
NOT THE TREES (6718398)

Unnatural concentrations of ambient aether coupled with countless seasons of unobstructed sunlight can be attributed to the freakishly abnormal growth of the Diadem's bilokos─seedkin that if not laid low, will devour any living plant or animal within the reach of their probing roots and branches.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tightropen (6718382)

Pteranodons have long been hated amongst fishers, for they are known to greedily devour the selfsame wavekin those men and women depend upon for their livelihoods. Amongst the flying gluttons, there are some which are despised above all others─Ropen, whose mouths are so large, it is said they can scoop a hundred fish in a single dive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm the Scatman (6718369)

A sun-blotting flock of pteranodons is causing headaches for Ishgardian farmers in the most unexpected of manners. The feces of these prehistoric relics is highly corrosive, and can render a plot of land barren with just a single drop...let alone the hundreds that fall with a single flyby.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wild Hunt (6719599)

Known to hunt in pairs─one acting as a decoy, while another attacks from behind─the coelophysis of the Diadem have abandoned their old hunting grounds and taken to the skies above the adventurer campsites and airship landings so that they might stalk their newest delicacy─Lalafell.

Mad Ventures in Retainer-sitting (6719661)

Not content with the paltry pickings his retainer was retrieving from ventures into the Black Shroud, a well-to-do noble recently ordered his humble hireling to the Diadem, forbidding the retainer's return until “treasure worthy of a king” was discovered. All the poor soul discovered, however, was a den of starving sky creatures, and now requires aid in escape.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
(You're) Killing My Mitelings (6719081)

A clutch of mite eggs has hatched and now a swarm of ageless mitelings is crawling about the isle consuming aught that moves. Squash the pests before they grow large enough to squash you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(You're) Having My Mitelings (6718341)

For the vilekin of the Diadem, every season is mating season, and so it is not rare to come across the cacophonous chittering and chirping that is an ageless mite orgy. A female mite can lay upwards of a thousand eggs in a single clutch, so it is left to brave adventurers to see the spawn never take seed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nice Pirates (6718352)

A gods-fearing, mother-loving, goodly sky pirate has fallen from the rigging of his crew's airship. While fate deemed it not his time, and saw him land safely upon a tuft of crownbrush, fortune was not as impressed and made certain that tuft was located right in the middle of one of the Diadem's most deadly isles. Needless to say, the plucky picaroon might require some assistance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
(You're Not) Having My Mitelings (6659906)

Not all diremites are successful in finding a mate, leaving those which don't slightly more agitated than those which do. That agitation oft results in violent outbursts that can last several days until an islet is left a smoldering waste, or until the pent-up sexual tension is fully expelled.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Root of the Problem (6719460)

A scavenger, the Bariaua feeds solely on carrion, setting down its roots into corpses and draining them of their remaining humours. What makes this voracious seedkin different is that when hungry, it will not wait to come across a fallen creature, opting rather to slay its own prey in the most violent of fashions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Good-bye Solo (6719156)

It is not known why Gerjis stalks his prey with a lone companion rather than bring the full strength of his pack to the hunt. What is known is that this practice has honed his skills as a predator, making the beast one of the most deadly sabertooth tigers in the whole Diadem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Purple Haze (6724406)

Purple worms spend nearly the entirety of their lives underground, rising to the surface only once or twice a twelvemoon to feed. It is during these brief forays into the sun that the creatures wreak the most havoc, devouring anything and everything they can before returning to the soil to slowly digest their victims.

Fly by Day (6718241)

Forest for the Trees (6718451)

The return of the Missing Gem to the Diadem has resulted in further disruption of already erratic ambient aether levels. As a result, species native to the isles such as ageless meliae have grown increasingly violent, posing an immediate threat to scholars and naturalists studying the area.

Hard of Heren (6719599)

Having lived for a thousand years encountering neither Lalafell nor Hyur, the Diadem's herensugues no longer fear mankind and his weapons of war. In their ignorance have they grown bold, leading to many attacks on newly arrived explorers to the islands. It is time they are reintroduced to the pain that kept their ancestors at bay.

The Other White Meat (6719661)

Until recently bottom feeders, many speckled hakulaqs have, of late, developed a taste for more exotic fare─more namely adventurous fishers braving the Diadem in search of their next catch. Volunteers are sought to help frighten off the hakulaqs that all might cast their lines in peace.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Westwhirled (6718998)

Named such for their tendencies to ride the Sea of Clouds' westerly winds, westerly sanuwas are an aggressive cousin to the common sanuwa, and are easily agitated by intruders into their domain. This includes airships, which oft use the westerlies to reduce ceruleum consumption on long voyages.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Am I Blue (6652596)

The Vundu are not ones to show kindness to the sanuwa they capture and tame, employing pain to force their mounts into ultimate submission. Some, however, resist this training and escape back to the skies, though not without their share of scars to the soul. Those known as the Deep Blue are one such example, their hatred of the foul men who laid hands upon them so great, that now they kill without discretion.

Who's for Dinner (6719148)

The serpent-like Uncegila are frighteningly methodical in how they prepare their prey for consumption, first crushing its bones to prevent escape, then delivering a powerful toxin which softens muscle tissue to a paste-like texture, but without killing the victim. The scalekin then devour the quivering mass feetfirst so that they might revel in their prey's final screams.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
On the Inside (6724695)

While much remains unknown about the charybterix, harrowing accounts of the colossal cloudkin using its scimitar-like claws to disembowel its victims have proven enough to convince House Haillenarte that a preemptive strike is the best interest of any and all who plan future forays into the Diadem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Blacker than the Foulest Witch (6860811)

Looking upon these frail creatures, one would not think that unicorns could contain much power. Yet when they are angered, that power oft translates into untold carnage and destruction. Woe betide the man who is fooled by their appearance, for bejeweled unicorns will not hesitate to drive their single majestic horns so deep into your gut, only a spell of temporal reconfiguration might remove them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
How I Met Your Marid (6719599)

Marids are not known for being nocturnal creatures...yet one of the largest ever observed─Iriz Ima─prefers to feed under cover of night. Its eyes, however, are not suited for seeing in the dark, meaning these evening strolls oft end in the untimely flattening of countless animals, minerals, and Lalafells.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lunantishee in the Sky (6719553)

Extreme levels of ambient aether can not only lead to the increased size and ferocity of a creature, but also to enhanced fertility. Case in point: the Diadem currently finds itself overrun with lunantishee seedlings who, if not dealt with swiftly, will grow into a veritable army of bloodsucking shrubbery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty Flies (6720169)

Jewel flies earn their name from the bright, ruby-like color of their abdomens─a hue achieved by filling those translucent bellies with the blood of any creature luckless enough to cross the vilekin's path.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Horse Outside (6797191)

Upon capture by a wicked Hingan onmyoji, the nine-tailed fox spirit slumbering deep within the young maiden Mikuzume awakens. Now, the only way to stop the legendary Tamamo Gozen is with an excessive display of force.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Outfoxed (6793524)

Onmyoji from the Hingan island of Koshu seek to kidnap the young Maiden Mikuzume and subject her to their fell rituals of exorcism. Slay the false priests before the girl is harmed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Freedom Flies (6987238)

Kinko is hotly pursued by several unsavory characters, and fears she will be unable to make it to safety on her own. If only some brave soul would see the roads safe once more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
More to Offer (6987239)

Hungry Namazu have disturbed the offerings young Ginko has left for a fox who protects the wood. Ginko would gather them herself, but she fears the thieves may still be nearby and seeks a kind soul to search in her stead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Showing the Recruits What For (6825281)

The Eorzean Alliance has no shortage of recruits willing to fight under its ivory standard. What it *does* have a shortage of is skilled fighters to assist in training the mewling privates. Adventurers are sought to bloody some noses.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Showing the Officers What For (6858956)

It has been overlong since the Eorzean Alliance has taken part in any serious tactical engagements, and while peace is good for the realm, it dulls both swords and sword arms. Adventurers are sought to serve as the whetstones that will restore the army's edge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Showing the Commanders What For (6873411)

Without competent commanders, the Eorzean Alliance would be naught more than an army of drunken farmhands and restless mercenaries, incapable of finding their way out of the South Shroud, let alone driving the Garlean invaders from Eorzea. However, to become a competent commander, one must first train against competent foes...or in other words─you.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Death Beckons (6850932)

Timmon Beck serves as the sole source of fresh water for many of the residents of East End...which is why the congregation of recently arrived sarcosuchus cannot be suffered to remain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unbearable (6853372)

Drawn from their dens by the ripe odor of the Eorzean Alliance's latrines, mountain grizzly sightings have become increasingly common as of late, some of these chance encounters leading to serious maiming or even death. The Allied armies seek adventurers to frighten the beasts back into the hills.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Secret Life of Plants (6851008)

Gyr Abania has its share of unique highland flora, from prickly thistles, to verdant worts, to *man-eating sapria*. It suffices to say the latter is not one of which the local smallfolk think that highly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dizzy Miss Grizzly (6873001)

Flame scouts with the Eorzean Alliance are failing to return to their camps. The culprit, however, does not appear to be the Garleans, but a deadly grizzly sow that has acquired a taste for sweet Lalafellin flesh. As the scouts cannot afford to lose any more of their number, they seek adventurers to cleanse the hills in their stead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Roid Rage (6852574)

Sightings of a gargantuan sarcosuchus colorfully dubbed the “Crocoroid” have residents of the Gyr Abanian Fringes guessing as to its origins, the most popular theory being it swelled to its unnatural size by consuming the discarded bottles of imperial performance-enhancing elixirs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeping the Peace (6865921)

When not plotting the overthrow of imperial regime, members of the Ala Mhigan Resistance are tasked with maintaining the peace in the Fringes─ridding the hills and highlands of aggressive fauna whose populations have exploded since the Garlean occupation claimed the lives of many of the region's hunters.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Keeping More Peace (6873932)

When not plotting the overthrow of imperial regime, members of the Ala Mhigan Resistance are tasked with maintaining the peace in the Fringes─ridding the hills and highlands of aggressive fauna whose populations have exploded since the Garlean occupation claimed the lives of many of the region's hunters.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Double Dhara (6873392)

A Resistance fighter separated from his company finds himself surrounded by vengeful elementals and unable to stave off their methodical assault. Race to his aid and earn the gratitude of all Ala Mhigo...or at least his commanding officer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bold This Way (6872768)

A pack of young-yet-bold gagana view the sheer cliffs surrounding Rhalgr's Reach as a prime location for their new nests. If allowed to roost on the rocks, it will not be long before the birds are raiding the town's livestock pens. Supplies are already scarce, so a quick solution to this potential problem is sought.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Morning After (6853610)

Swarms of skimmers─some of the vilest of all vilekin─have alighted in the Fringes to mate, and nothing works up an appetite like a frenzied fortnight of fornication. Unfortunately, skimmers have a taste for meat, preferably live, and will attack almost anything and everything that moves, be it livestock, pets, even something as large as a grown Roegadyn.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank You for Not Mossling (6870261)

While they appear harmless, mosslings are a threat to the fish that share the rivers in which they dwell. If left unchecked, a single colony of these swift-spawning, swift-growing seedkin can cover an entire lake in a matter of moons, blocking sunlight from reaching the riverbed, effectively killing the river's flora and the fauna that feed on it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mail Must Get Through (6870279)

A storm herald carrying an important communication for his commanders is unable to cross the Velodyna, his way blocked by a school of goosefish. Part the waters and clear the poor man a path to freedom.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Diakka Round (6873002)

A company of Eorzean Alliance regulars has been ordered to slay a pack of deadly diakka believed to be the culprits in a disturbing string of missing draught chocobos. Never ones to underestimate their enemy, the company is requesting the assistance of nearby adventurers and is willing to split any spoils earned in the raid.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Evil Seed (6865562)

Legend states that all diakka were born of seeds scattered by Kirnis in her wanderings across Gyr Abania. She continues her journey to this day, spawning more of the deadly seedkin while feeding herself upon the blood of unwary bystanders.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Spiderweb Chronicles (6866392)

The larger the spider, the larger the prey it must capture to sate its hunger...and Ankabut is one of the largest spiders to ever be reported in Eorzea. The muffled whimperings heard from the silken sacs on her webs suggest no one in Eorzea is safe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Antlion's Share (6865951)

Ever seeking to expand their own dominion, aggressor antlions have begun encroaching on M tribe territory. If the trend is allowed to continue, it will not be long before young huntresses start disappearing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Really Don't Keratyrannos (6853256)

With their invasion, the Garleans brought with them myriad beasts of war and burden not native to Gyr Abania. Some of these, such as the keratyrannos, have escaped from their masters and now thrive in the highlands where they have no natural predators. Their numbers must be thinned before a disaster strikes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Sharp (6858559)

As she does every day, a young maid of the M tribe has ventured into the wilds to gather sharp stones for her aunt, the village fletcher. This day, however, the hills are alive with deadly dhara. Is there none who would see the area rid of these creatures so that the youth might be spared her aunt's lashing rod?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tele-tale Hunt (6850927)

Ala Mhigan Resistance fighters have established supply caches across Gyr Abania in preparation for skirmishes with the Empire. Starved creatures of the region such as the saw-toothed teleoceras will raid these crates and devour their contents, and missions to drive off the scalekin are required to maintain supply stocks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pop the Trunk (6873417)

The Vira keep marids not only for use in battle, but for their rich, fatty milk. The beasts, however, can be quite temperamental, and it is not rare that a beastmaid will lose track of one or two of her herd when grazing them in highland meadows. A good whack or seventeen is usually enough to calm their nerves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Pain in the Neck (6858345)

Last night, under the cover of darkness, Ananta of the Qalyana tribe raided a Vira beadmaid's workshop, stealing a goodly amount of jewelry meant for a coming ritual. Having no skill in the art of war, the beadmaid seeks aid in the recovery of her livelihood.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flappy Berda (6853679)

Once again, warriors of the M tribe hunt the Scourge of the Skies; the Feathered Fiend; White Death. The warriors hunt Berda, and welcome any who might seek to share in their glory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ananta and Her Sisters (6869676)

A party of Ananta battlemaids seek revenge for the wanton slaughter of several of their defenseless sisters at the hands of Jateryu─a bloodthirsty monster that rips open the bellies of its victims with its hooked claws. The battlemaids would not turn away those who might endeavor to aid their quest for ultion.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raisin' Hell (6873418)

Impressed with your handling of her tribe's unruly marids, the Vira's champion Sunmaid Drisana seeks to ask you one more boon─to cross blades in mock battle.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, This Is Dogs (6855372)

Trained from birth to kill on command, the Garlean Empire's canis pugnaces are feared across the realm. Now, reports are that several of the murdering machines have escaped their captors' fetters and are roaming the Fringes, taking out their aggressions on any moving thing in sight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
M Bop (6870247)

Archers of the M tribe will not suffer the likes of the Qalyana defiling their sacred hunting lands and are petitioning local adventurers to join them in driving off the sly serpentesses.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wet (6906128)

Her name meaning literally “wet woman,” Nure-onna is a malevolent spirit who has taken the form of a beautiful young maiden to lure men into her lair. Here, she flays her victims and feeds them to her pets─loyal gyuki demons who do her every bidding.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean Bill of Health (6906399)

The hornbills that nest on the myriad islets of the Ruby Sea can prove a breathtaking sight from afar; however, up close, their rookeries are laden with foul-smelling bird lime that causes all manner of maladies when taken into the lungs. The Confederacy will pay handsomely for the removal of these winged pests.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Quoth the Raven (6906456)

Ruby Sea alehouses are abuzz with tales of an ill-omened bird sailors have dubbed “Forevermore.” If the stories are to be believed, the cloudkin will alight upon a ship's prow and repeat the words “forever and ever” several times over before flying off to the horizon. The following morning, if even a third of the crew remains, they can consider themselves fortunate. Now, that bird is said to be frightfully near...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lay of the Lang (6906497)

A lone wolf is terrorizing the village of Isari, stealing livestock and defiling rice paddies. There are even rumors that he whispers in children's ears as they sleep, telling them to ignore their chores and disobey their elders. It is high time someone did something about Kuimu Lang, and that someone is you!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pool Party (6910545)

A school of testy tatsunoko have congregated in the Blue Kojin's sunbathing pools and threaten to drive the peaceful beastmen from their daily basks. Drive the wavekin back into the seas whence they came so that the Blue might warm their shells once again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Soak Up the Sun (6910583)

From Kugane's back alleys to her bathhouses, dark rumors spread like blood from the neck of a decapitated criminal. The rumor? That the decapitated head of Mishirushi─a fallen warrior executed for murder─has come back to life to continue its killing ways, slicing up innocent maidens with its crab-like claws. Crab-like claws?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Agni's Philosophy (6910755)

When not devouring the very lava that oozes forth from Hells' Lid, the fire-aspected anala, Agni, is devouring those foolish enough to approach her demesne. Have you the mettle to quell her flames of rage?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Coral High Ground (6925102)

The Ruby Tithe is not the only manner in which pirates of the Confederacy line their coffers with coin. Some lower-ranking members are tasked with gathering beached coral for sale to Kugane's lapidaries. One such enterprising young pirate is offering a percentage of her cut to all who aid her in her search.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Big Banquet Theory (6911070)

The Coral Banquet─haven for the Confederacy─is under attack by a company of Red Kojin who show little interest in negotiation. While not believed a threat to the outpost, every moment spent fending off the assailants is a moment not spent fighting the Confederacy's bigger battles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncivil Serpents (6916942)

Apparently not satisfied with being relegated to the briny deep, a brood of slithering spotted sea serpents has set its sights on the sun-dried hills and dales of the Ruby Sea's islands, and are prepared to take them with venom-fueled force.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ray Band (6913107)

Seeking to bring a swift end to their never-ending conflict with the Confederacy, the Red Kojin have led a school of poisonous striped rays into pirate territory, overwhelming many of the sentries stationed on the island's outskirts. Protect the survivors and hold off the intruders until reinforcements arrive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Princess, Princess (6913194)

Nagori, Confederacy pirate, has sworn to exact revenge on the flying shark that swooped down and ate her younger brother while he was strapping his boots. This is easier said than done, for the culprit is none other than Yahiro─feared princess of the razor-toothed wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kill the Messenger (6918431)

Bi fang─a predatory bird native to Yanxia─are widely thought of as harbingers of ill fortune, so when an entire flock arrives from the west, one might understand why they would be so willing to pay good coin to see the birds slain and their bodies tossed to the tides.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The F-bomb (6918515)

Eorzean scholars of the void have yet to determine whether or not the Ruby Sea's bombfish are in fact voidsent like their western counterparts, or simply a unique aquatic species native to Hydaelyn. Any and all observations on habitat and behavior in battle will be paid for in good coin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raise the Red Flag (6919179)

Amahire the Redmost commands a party of Kojin raiders and striped rays in a surprise assault on Sakazuki. Drive the invaders back to the Ruby Sea before they do any real damage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Double Dream Clams (6919818)

The Ruby Sea shellfish known as yumemi will sometimes remain dormant on the ocean floor for several moons, siphoning aether from thermal fissures and storing it inside its shell. Once enough mana has been accumulated, the mollusk will rise from the depths and emerge to hunt on land, killing indiscriminately with its primitive magicks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
There Be Dragonflies (6919894)

A plague of dawnborn dragonflies comes from the north and west threatening the flora and fauna of the Ruby Sea's isolated islands. The coastal villages are banding together to drive back the vilekin and would not turn away an adventurer with a mind to help.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bilge-hold Jin (6953906)

Confederate pirates were in for the surprise of their lives when a stowaway was discovered in the bilges after a recent raid to the coasts of Koshu. This was no ordinary stowaway, however, but a massive bull demon known to Hingans as Jinrinki. How it came to hide in the ship, none know, but now that it is out, it must be put down.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Days of Plunder (6954518)

Red Kojin have risen from the seas to plunder the Confederacy of plunder it rightfully plundered. To protect this plunder from future plundering, the pirates have assigned a man to guard the hidden plunder caches. The problem is, this guard is the greenest of green recruits, and fares little chance of emerging from the coming encounter with his head.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Forever Younglier (6969196)

Insistent on plundering the pirates of their hard-plundered plunder, the Red Kojin have sent in one of their finest warriors, a thick-shelled veteran known as Katabira the Younglier, who also happens to be a master of ninjutsu.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Treasure Island (6977498)

Several curiosities have been stolen from altars tended to by the Blue Kojin. The perpetrators─unsurprisingly a band of Red Kojin─still lurk nearby, and the Blues are seeking help in locating the thieves and taking back what is rightfully theirs...using any means necessary.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sailor Marooned (6920349)

Some say shiranui are the restless spirits of shipwrecked sailors. Others, the signal lamps of draconian deities. What they all agree on is that when even one appears─let alone an entire congregation─lives will be lost.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Jumping the Shark (6920409)

When a school of flying sharks have devoured all the life in one corner of the sea yet remain unsated, they turn their fins to the shallows, where they hunt everything from birds to tigers...and even the occasional Lalafell!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red Cliff (6920428)

Cast from the cliffs for stealing relics from his temple, the priest Sogenbi's body perished on the rocks below, but his evil spirit remained, bound to the corporeal realm. Now he wanders the Ruby Sea, preying on the souls of the innocent...and the not-so-innocent, when no innocent are available.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranging Bull (6920432)

The bull-like demons known as gyuki are known to prefer the colder northern climes, yet will ever so often journey south to the Ruby Sea to feed when food is scarce. A herd approaches now, and local fishers fear that if measures are not taken, the seas will soon empty.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Another One Bites the Dust (6950852)

After moons of training in his secluded mountain hovel, Senban Oneblade has journeyed down to the Ruby Sea in search of worthy opponents with whom he can test his newly acquired skills. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Turtle Power (6952548)

Hearing that Senban Oneblade has come down from his mountain hovel, a Red Kojin warrior seeks to steal the hermit's one blade─Kame-wari─waiting until he is overcome with fatigue from one of his challenges before launching their attack. Defend the injured Senban from his assailants so that he may live to train another day.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crab Mentality (6923126)

Unkiu hunt by riding ocean currents, preserving energy until they have spotted their prey which, for these unfussy eaters with perpetually empty bellies, is just about anything with meat on its bones.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Independence Ray (6920459)

The striped ray is one of the Ruby Sea's most deadly predators and almost impossible to tame, so it is a testament to the Red Kojin's tenacity...or stubbornness that they endeavor to do so. However, it is not rare to find that one or more of the wavekin have again escaped their captors' nets, even more frenzied than they were before.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Never Say Daimyo (6930715)

Yumemi never stop growing, adding to their bulk with every turn of the moon. Those few which have survived the longest are dubbed “daimyo,” and must literally eat constantly to sustain life...much to the chagrin of fishers who are left with empty seas in the yumemi's wake.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A New Leaf (6937479)

Mimiroon Leafgrinder's companions have been ratnapped, and the kindly Qiqirn finds himself unable to free them on his own. Mimiroon seeks an equally kind adventurer to serve as his sword while he uses his sensitive snout to suss out the location of his soul-shrews.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Salad Days (6943924)

It appears Mimiroon Leafgrinder and his herbivorous helpers are not as opposed to consuming meat as his own name would suggest...and it appears you are on the menu.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Bone to Pick (7021465)

The Bonecruncher formerly known as Leafgrinder has proven himself a right scoundrel, and this affront cannot well be forgiven lest he endeavor to repeat the ruse on another unsuspecting rube.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
And the Bandits Played On (6915025)

Residents of Ala Gannha tend not to stray too far from the protective walls of their humble hamlet, for when they do, a Qiqirn bandit is usually there waiting to steal their clothes, their coin, or worse...their lives. Escorts are thoroughly appreciated, and handsomely paid.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Of Mice and Men (6918389)

Ever the greedy gluttons, a band of Qiqirn cutthroats have descended the Peaks to raid local farmsteads of their bountiful harvest. The smallfolk cannot defend their land armed with but spades and hoes. An adventurer, however, may have more success.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Churlish Chapuli (6906342)

Those who have chosen to make their homes on the unforgiving slopes of the Peaks have done well to coax whatever plant they can from the barren soil. Which is why it is all the more disheartening to see those hard-earned crops torn from the fields by gluttonous vilekin─vilekin like the dread chapuli.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Down with the Sickness (6923507)

The lichyard behind Ala Gannha is full to bursting with the freshly buried bodies of those to have recently succumbed to the Weeping Cough─an affliction that induces hacking fits so terrible, that it makes the victim shed tears. The cause of this illness? The scales shed by the giant moth-like bloodgliders that fly over the village at night. If they were to be slain, the people might be saved.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Child's Plague (6906407)

Ala Mhigan legend tells of an ancient Gyr Abanian king whose pride angered the gods and brought upon his fertile land a plague of winged insects that devoured all grass and trees, leaving the desolate Peaks that remain to this day. The vilekin chapulis are believed by some to be the remnants of that plague.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
You Don't Know Jack (6906488)

While some beetles will scour forests for entire days in search of wounded trees from which they can sip sticky sweet sap, one particular vilekin simply uses its head. Literally. Lumber Jack is notorious for violently butting against solemn sentinels until they topple so he may suck the life from the exposed trunk. If let to continue, there might not be a single tree left in all the Peaks come winter.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Winging It (6906504)

Wings of orange herald the morn
Wings of white herald the night
Wings of gold herald the cold
Wings of purple...are filled with deadly poison what will melt your organs from the inside. Always take care when dealing with wings of purple, and Etain─queen of the fluturini─has a pair of the purplest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Beat Boxes (6929113)

Qiqirn cutthroats are preparing an assault on Ala Gannha and have consolidated their weaponry in conveniently labeled lockboxes conveniently located not far from the humble hamlet. If someone were to destroy these boxes and their contents, the bumbling bandits would be oh, so inconvenienced.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Barbershoppe (6913104)

Despite his title, the Brutal Barber is by no means a licensed practitioner of medicine, and any limbs entrusted to his care will most likely be lopped off, regardless of whether or not they require medical treatment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fletching Returns (6929845)

Seeing an opportunity to profit off the coming conflict, an independent sutler is collecting griffin feathers that he plans on crafting into arrows─arrows that he will sell at a premium to the Ala Mhigan Resistance, the griffin being the symbol of their fallen city–state. The sutler will gladly purchase any feathers you happen upon, as well.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Days of Fluturini Past (6913117)

Adult fluturini will lay hundreds of eggs each day, and while some of these eggs will be consumed by predators, their sheer number ensures that many will survive to hatch...grow...and kill. Seek out and swat the swarms which threaten to wreak havoc in the Peaks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Diceman Cometh (6913148)

Pious men say that gambling is a sin and that those who lose themselves in games of trump and dice will be damned to the seven hells where their spirits will become corporeal manifestations of their worldly vice. As ridiculous as this may sound, the mere existence of the fell Crapaud makes a good case in favor of the pious.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stuck in the Muud (6913151)

Muud suuds have been cursed by the gods with an insatiable hunger that drives the creatures to madness. When not devouring flesh, be it rotting or fresh, they are searching for flesh...be it rotting or fresh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eat Big or Go Home (6913200)

To sate their appetites, highland erucas do not bother with “smaller” prey such as rabbits, tigers, and chocobos. Qiqirn merchants, Ananta battlemaids, Roegadyn mercenaries. These are what the vilekin crave.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Love Me, Tindalos (6913332)

They say that dogs are a man's best friend. Tindalos, on the other hand, is no friend to man...or woman, for that matter. Tindalos is merely hungry, and would rather devour any and all who dare cross his path than make their humble acquaintance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Home on the Range (6926742)

Upset that his father insisted he take up the plow over the sword, a young boy of Rustrock decided he would leave the safety of his family's farmstead behind and join the Ala Mhigan Resistance. What he failed to take into consideration were all the ravenous beasts that would be waiting for him in-between, and now desperately needs an escort home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rattle and Humbaba (6927971)

Life in the Peaks can be downright difficult, but the people of the J tribe somehow manage with what little they have. Yet, when what little they have is constantly being stolen by a heartless brute by the name of Humbaba, that is simply salt in their wounds. The J seek a champion that might ease their pain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Forget-me-not (6928936)

A warrior of Coldhearth who journeyed to the Bull's Bath for his weekly dip forgot his sword by the pond, and now finds himself assailed by kongamato with no way to defend himself. Assist the man home where he may procure a second sword to help him retrieve his first.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Day of the Griffins (6913412)

The founders of Ala Mhigo chose the griffin for their kingdom's standard for its strength, ferocity, cunning, and endurance─all traits that make the winged beastkin one of the most deadly creatures you will ever meet, if not the *last* creature you ever meet.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Venting (6914740)

Anila are dreadful creatures whose incessant gyrations birth hot, sand-filled storms that ruin crops and send caravans tumbling from canyon-tops. Ventus is by far the worst of this breed, grown fat on the flesh of its lesser brothers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Breakneck (6914749)

When the King of Ruin fell, his head executioner, refusing to be subjected to the same cold justice he dealt his entire life, slit his own throat. Unable to bear the loss, the executioner's pet beast─Neckbreaker─took to the Peaks, where he has been continuing his kind master's work ever since, much to the chagrin of the region's innocent residents.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack of the Groans (6914787)

When an anila spins, it kicks up copious amounts of dust─dust that is coarse and rough and irritating and gets literally everywhere. Every anila slain, a dervish averted. Every dervish averted, a pair of knickers free of sand's itchy burden.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moth to a Flame (6914806)

To hear the smallfolk of the Peaks tell it, one in three of every home set to flame is done so by the notorious pyromantic, Ignamoth. While these numbers may be inflated, that does not change the fact that a massive fire-starting vilekin is flying loose about the countryside, and should probably be put down. Quickly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Resist, Die, Repeat (6929025)

A Resistance fighter is putting up his best resistance against a flock of fighting chapuli who are resisting all his attempts to break free from the fighting. Are you so cold as to resist the call to aid in his fight?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Slaughterwife-five (6914831)

Nenaunir is said to have taken five wives─five wives he all loved with equal measure. When those wives were hunted and slain, he swore revenge against all mankind, and will not stop killing until he, himself, is killed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Das Bhoot (6914886)

Their rage binding them to the corporeal realm, the spirits of young Ala Mhigans slain at the hands of Garlean invaders roam the Peaks seeking vengeance even now, more than twenty summers removed from the fall of their kingdom. Release the spirits from this world that they might finally find respite in the beyond.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
5-year Energy (6914903)

Their large bodies and relatively bright coloring make erucas easy targets for hungry predators large enough not to become prey themselves. There lives, however, one worm so full of vim and vigor that it has eluded capture for five whole summers, allowing it to swell to its current gargantuan girth. It should be noted that vim and vigor came from consuming the local citizenry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mouth for Water (6950346)

Try as she might, J'najaq Sunflare is struggling to fend off the bloodthirsty panteras that threaten to maim and maul the J tribe maid who has come to the river to gather water. The warrioress sees you approach and sends a pleading glance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Magitek Is Back (6922579)

The Lethal Weapon was meant to give the Empire the upper hand against the armies of Eorzea, yet it proved too difficult to control for even the most experienced of magitek operators. The test model created was decommissioned and stored in a lonely warehouse where it was to await dismantling...until it *came to life*! Destroy the contraption before it lays waste to the entire front!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Tisket, a Tasket (6905399)

A humble Namazu by the name of Gyogun has returned home with a catch that will feed his family for days. Unfortunately, the aroma has garnered the attention of a pack of starving koja intent on turning Gyogun's pain into their gain. Protect Gyogun's full-to-bursting baskets so that his spawn need not go hungry tonight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Fish to Fry (6906060)

Not a moment after Gyogun's daring escape from the koja's prying paws is the poor Namazu surrounded by a school of his tribe's most rotten─the thugs intent on claiming the catch for their own. Gyogun's full-to-bursting baskets are once again in need of protecting, lest his spawn suffer the night with empty bellies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Falling Drown (6906061)

The day's events have transformed the mild-mannered Gyogun into a quivering mass of uncontrollable rage. If left to his own devices, the Namazu will most certainly cause unintended harm to others, if not himself. Attempts at rational discussion have been met with baleful stares and low growling. It appears the only way to soothe the savage fish may be through a few well-placed wallops to the head.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scared Straightheart (6905734)

While indeed many of the Lupin can prove difficult or even deadly, Gaei Straightheart is an honorable youth with a passion to right wrongs and defend those unable to defend themselves. That said, his passion for do-goodery oft runs him afoul with less-than-savory characters─characters not unlike those surrounding him now...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wolves of a Feather (6906062)

Alerted to their brother's plight, several of Gaei's pack have hurried to his side to assist in driving back those who would do him harm. Join the Lupin in their fight to defend Gaei.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Goodwill Hunterling (6906063)

Seeing their fortunes falter with the arrival of Gaei's pack, Straightheart's assailants summon forth their final weapon─an ill-reputed Kojin mercenary known as Wakizashi the Hunterling. Put him down, and the rest may finally admit defeat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stay of Eggsecution (6905322)

A murder of violent bi fang have alighted amidst hornbill nesting grounds, sending the already excited cloudkin into a frenzy for fear that their nests will be seized and their eggs stolen. Join the hornbills in driving off the invaders and protecting their unborn young.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Ready for a Nu Wave (6906064)

The bi fang driven back to the mountains, the hornbills returned to their nests content...until through the quiet fields of rice they saw slither a serpent with eyes like rubies and a mouth like a dying sun. Nu Wa─bane of the Gensui Chain─had come for its favorite prey: eggs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deep Red Sea (6905337)

In search of prey, flying sharks native to the Ruby Sea have swum upstream into the brackish mouth of the One River to feed on anything and everything that might call the delta home─including those fish already caught in local Doman fishers' nets.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
To Catch a Weasel (6905333)

While the term “weasel” conjures images of small, scrawny rodents, Doman weasels are anything but small or scrawny. In addition, the massive beastkin have a remarkably acute sense of smell, and can detect the scent of blood from over a malm distant. Drawn by your slaughter of the flying sharks, the wickedest of weasels─Fuchikari─has descended to the One River and threatens to wreak utter havoc.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Footing the Bills (6905275)

River hornbills, while mostly harmless, can prove quite testy come mating season─males unable to find mates giving to frequent bouts of violence against any man or animal unfortunate enough to be nearby. For the residents of quiet Namai, it is during this time that their little corner of heaven cut from the Gensui Chain turns into hell.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tiger Need (6905306)

It is rare for a Yanxian tiger to attack someone without provocation unless it is extremely hungry. Unfortunately, Yanxian tigers require twice their weight in raw meat every day, meaning they are almost *always* hungry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leave the Meters Running (6905296)

Every planting season, the rice farmers of Namai must deal with all manner of pests and blights which threaten to spoil entire crops. One of the biggest of those, by far, are plagues of geometers─voracious vilekin which can devour an entire paddy of seedlings in a matter of bells, leaving naught but caustic droppings which poison the land.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Long and Rhino Road (6905324)

Unlike other vilekin whose insatiable appetites pose a threat to Namai's secluded rice paddies, rhino beetles are feared and despised for a completely different reason─their stampedes. Rhino beetles will descend upon the village in herds, flattening anything in their path as they search for the sweet tree sap upon which they feed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Raze the Red Lantern (6905342)

During the Garlean invasion of Doma, large swathes of Yanxian wilderness were razed, leaving nothing but the charred remains of once-lush forests. The fauna that once called that land home has been forced to roam deep into the realm of man in search of food. The violent exchanges that have erupted as a result have left many a family grieving the loss of a loved one.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Long Hands, Long Fingers (6905384)

The Far East is home to countless fantastical creatures unknown to those raised in the West. One such example is the “tenaga” or “longhands”─wooden gargoyles born of corrupted aether that has permeated the roots of certain trees. Though different in many ways, their lust for murder, however, very much mirrors that of their Eorzean counterparts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rice and Shine (6905319)

Namazu wildlings have once again invaded Namai; though not in search of food or coin, but intent on stealing the village's stock of rice seedlings. If not retrieved, the farmers will miss their planting window, and risk losing their entire crop─a disaster that would leave more than one family hungry come winter.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
In One Basket (6905318)

The rice farmers of Namai have few qualms with the river hornbills that make their nests alongside the village paddies...as long as the cloudkin's populations are kept under control. This requires periodical checks of their nests and the removal of eggs in cases where there are more than one. One farmhand seeks the aid of adventurers to help him complete this surprisingly dangerous task.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tsurubebi Snugly (6905533)

Minobi are brilliant fire-aspected specters who dwell in the valleys nestled 'twixt the Gensui Chain's ebon peaks. While most are solitary creatures, legend has that one─Tsurubebi─has grown fat supping on the very souls of its brethren, and that the power gained has rendered it quite mad.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Motherly Love (6905321)

From their birth, Doman children are told terrifying tales of Songsi, a crimson cloudkin that lures boys and girls from their homes by calling out in an eerily womanlike voice. Once their victims have strayed far enough from safety, the monster will swoop down and snatch up the children, then carry them back to its mountaintop nest where it will tear them limb from limb for its own fledglings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Killer Apsaras (6905525)

The foul discharge of the Garlean invaders' warmachina not only spoils the land, preventing crops from growing, but corrupts the very aether that flows through her. Elemental creatures that draw energy from this aether are driven to madness, such as the once-peaceful Apsaras─now feared by all who call Doma home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Linquan Continental (6905340)

If there is one thing the continent of Othard is not lacking, it is colorful tales of legendary monster dogs who stalk the shadows in search of virgin maids and succulent babes. Linquan is one such monster dog, and yes, everything you have heard about the abomination is true. Especially the part about the succulent babes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
This Is a Da, This Is a Peng (6905396)

Legend says that Dapeng─a massive cloudkin several times larger than its bi fang cousins─has a wingspan so large that it supposedly blots out the sun. However, if you are close enough to Dapeng that you can no longer see the sun, then chances are the last thing you are worried about is seeing the sun.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Oneblade Wonder (6905527)

A Hingan swordsman wandering through Doma on a journey of enlightenment and self-betterment has stumbled across a scarecrow possessed of a shikigami─a minor spirit─believed no longer under the control of its conjurer. Though he insists he is fine, it is obvious the swordsman is in over his head, and will require assistance if he is to escape this horror with his life.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mister Whiskers (6905577)

Namazu bandits are the slipperiest of thieves, both literally and figuratively, and while for the most part they prove bumbling and incompetent, their sheer numbers make them a real threat for solitary travelers. Adventurers experienced in the disciplines of war or magic are sought to deal with the nuisance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crying Wolves (6905753)

Lupin who have, for one reason or another, been driven from their packs will oft end up members of small independent parties which seek revenge on those they believe wrong them─which, in their mind, ends up being everyone but themselves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mada's Ilk (6905601)

A pack of mada have journeyed far south from their native Azim Steppe to hunt and have settled on a location far too close for the comfort of those stationed in the House of the Fierce. Join the would-be liberators in this test of strength and bravery.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tora Tora Tora (6905622)

Fearing the flying sharks of the One River, several Namazu have come to Prism Lake to bathe. To their surprise, they find themselves out of the frypan yet into the fire when a clowder of rainbow tigers spots them on the shore and decides it is time for supper...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ragoh to Extremes (6905779)

When the master of a summoned shikigami such as Ragoh dies before the spirit can be returned to its plane of origin, its mind slowly succumbs to madness, unable to anchor itself in reality. This is when the spirits are their most dangerous, and if not dealt with swiftly, bring about great tragedy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Très Bian (6905775)

The ruins of the once-majestic Doman Enclave are all but abandoned by man, leaving room for a new leader, one that rules with an iron hand...er, paw─Bian. Yet now, the regent grows bold, leading his hunting parties of rainbow tigers deep into liberator camps. Perhaps it is nigh time the king is declawed and dethroned.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Curiosity Killed the Catfish (6905783)

Instead of leaving the giant contraption alone, several Namazu who stumbled upon an abandoned automaton of unknown origin felt compelled to poke it with sticks, ultimately awakening the metal beast now compelled to vaporize everything that moves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Virgin Homicides (6905311)

More of Doma's many legendary demon dogs have appeared to terrorize the land's young virgins who, it appears, demon dogs prefer over young harlots, old virgins, and old harlots. Think of the virgins. The young ones.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead to Rites: Kiyofusa (6905368)

An onmyoji from the Hingan isle of Koshu has sailed to Yanxia to perform unthinkable rites banned in his homeland. It is through blood sacrifice, that the wicked priest has summoned forth a restless spirit─a shikigami─and granted it a body in which it might now sow terror into the hearts of all Domans.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead to Rites: Koja (6905394)

An onmyoji from the Hingan isle of Koshu has sailed to Yanxia to perform unthinkable rites banned in his homeland. It is through blood sacrifice, that the wicked priest has summoned forth a restless spirit─a shikigami─and granted it a body in which it might now sow terror into the hearts of all Domans.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't You Mean Kirata (6926741)

Some tribes of the steppe require of their youths the slaying of a ferocious beast, such as a baras, to prove their journey to adulthood is complete. One clever baras─a monster known as Kirata─has learned to use these rites of passage as an opportunity to hunt for the tender flesh of the unbloodied.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The State of Reunion (6929038)

Reunion is the one place on the Azim Steppe where the myriad Xaela tribes can put aside their differences and come together as one to trade and to revel in relative peace. The terrible beast Narantsetseg, however, sees it merely as a place where prey gathers. Warriors of the Qestir have gathered to slay the creature and ask the help of any willing and able. That is, the tribe *would* ask if they ever talked.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold Comes the Wind (6930870)

Khatayin warriors led by Qatun Coldwind have descended from the north seeking a fight...and it happens the cave-dwelling Uyagir are the first in line. Join the Uyagir in protecting their homes and earn the respect of their peaceful tribe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Tall Order (6930904)

Towering hunters of the Olkund tribe have ventured into Oroniri territory to poach the land of its abundant fauna. Join warriors of the Oronir in protecting their sacred hunting grounds by driving off the Olkundi in the only way they will understand─with brute force.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Duck and Cover (6926750)

Xaela tribes across the Azim Steppe tell tales of a horrible giant duck that flies from beyond the Nhaama Desert every autumn to sup on the flesh of man. The word for “giant duck” sounds far more imposing in their native languages.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Feel the Noise (6927067)

At nightfall, a hush falls over the Azim Steppe, welcoming the Dusk Mother back to her throne that she may reign in blissful silence. In blissful silence *if* the manzasiri Rudra was not rousing the dead each and every evening with its incessant howling. A great boon is promised to he or she who quiets the veldt.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Get Out the Vochu (6927085)

Without its sea of emerald grass, the Azim Steppe would be but a desert...which is why the foul Vochu must be slain before its draining of the land's lifeblood leaves the region in ruin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Buzzkill (6927402)

Buzzflies do much more than simply buzz. They sting, they bite, and they eat...and eat, and eat, and eat. And what is worse, their preferred fare is the living flesh of the steppe's beastkin, which they douse in digestive juices so that they might sip the liquefied muscle from their victims' bones.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Good Day to Die (6975985)

For several moons, Bukidai the Wandering River worked Reunion's gambling tents, swindling many a hunter of their hard-earned pelts. Upon the discovery of his dishonest deeds, the man was rightly cast out of the city, yet the stubborn Bukidai feels he was wronged and now seeks to re-enter the city, by means of violence if necessary.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wooly Boys (6979763)

A Qestiri merchant finds himself on the wrong side of a mammoth herd and seeks assistance on removing the herd from between him and where he needs to be.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Razing the Baras (6927425)

Baras are some of the Azim Steppe's most feared predators. Not only are they lightning fast and possessed of razor-sharp claws, but they tend to hunt in groups, making them all the more deadly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fangover (6927440)

Driven from Yanxia by helpful adventurers, a flock of bi fang have flown north over the Gensui Chain and into the steppe in search of fresh meat. Fearing their livestock may be on the menu, several of the Xaela tribes seek helpful adventurers to herd the cloudkin back to Yanxia.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hat's Off (6927467)

Her belly nigh-bursting with eggs, queen of the steppe buzzflies─Hatan─searches for a place to lay her clutch. Knowing the chaos even a single buzzfly can herald, the immediate extermination of Her Royal Vileness is less a suggestion, and more a necessity for survival.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rock for Food (6930939)

A Xaela youth cozened by Ura miners descended from the mountains to trade their ore for food seeks retribution. While he may be in the right, he is also severely outnumbered, and seeks one brave of heart to stand at his side in his quest for justice.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Purbol Reign (6927478)

Something is in the air, and it is far from the sweet, alluring scent of roses or honey. The sound you hear is the collective gags of a thousand thousand Xaela as they suffer the ill winds born of the burps and belches of the dread purbol.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eat You Better (6928966)

Undsiig roams the steppe devouring the land's rare trees, mayhap believing that their gnarled flesh will strengthen his own. Whether or not this is true, the gluttonous seedkin must be stopped before not a single sentinel stands.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Man to Mangas (6930992)

Many of the Azim Steppe's dzos have been domesticated by the many Xaela tribes which rely on their hair, milk, and meat for survival. Tsaagan Mangas is one exception, this aggressive specimen grown large thanks to years of cunning. If one were to take this legend down, she would be seen as a hero among heroes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Not Just a Tribute (6928085)

A statue honoring legendary hero Gergei the Great has unexpectedly come to life, and appears to be just as hale as the warrior who it is said once slew an army of weasels with a single swing of his mighty fist.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Good Day to Mate (6928109)

Matamata are irritable enough year-round, but come mating season, the scalekin are downright unruly. It has even been suggested that the only thing keeping the steppe from being overrun is that the number of newborns are offset by the number of matamata killed by in-fighting between males in heat. Well, that and the hunting parties of adventurers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Killing Dzo (6933930)

A young nomad was leading her family's prized dzo back from a nearby watering hole when a pack of starved gedan emerged from the steppe's tall grass, intent on making the livestock its next victim. The girl seeks aid before the hounds close in.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Burn After Evening (6928901)

Hot winds blowing from the south have carried several fire sprites from the Nhaama Desert and into the Azim Steppe. If not dealt with immediately, the entire grassland might be in flames before next nightfall.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, Manzasiri (6928921)

The nomadic tribes of the Azim Steppe must face many hardships as they journey the grasslands in search of land where their livestock might graze─none of those greater than the wicked manzasiri. These formidable beasts are most feared by the Xaela for their tendency to kill not for food, but simply for the sheer enjoyment of it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Khan Artist (6928933)

Deadly steppe weasels known as gulo gulo are on the move, scampering and scurrying from camp to camp terrorizing livestock and their poor shepherds. With each taste of blood, the rodents grow frenzied, and only the pacification of their fearsome leader─Gulo Khan─might send them back to the hills, tails 'twixt their stubby legs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hook, Line, and Stinker (6934067)

Assigning names to the myriad creatures of the Azim Steppe has never been a strong suit of the Xaela nomads, so when a tribe came across a malcontent matamata whose skin reeked of the funk of forty-thousand summers, they named it Stinkskin and immediately put a bounty on its noisome nob.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fired (6928950)

What the nomadic Xaela truly fear (other than being slain or captured by aggressive tribes, being captured then eaten by aggressive beasts, and being eaten by aggressive beasts that steal you from a tribe that has captured you) are steppe wildfires, which can see entire herds of livestock starve. For this reason, flame-spouting anala can be afforded little in the way of tolerance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wham, Bam, Thank You, Mammoth (6934115)

When mammoths stampede, not much remains in their wake save blood and dust. When led by the mightiest mammoth of all─Mahishasura─that wake can stretch from one end of the steppe to the other. While the tribes may succeed in slowing the wooly beast, it will take the strength and wile of an adventurer to stop him.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
More than You Chaochu (6928958)

The ochu of Eorzea are but dainty daisies in a meadow when compared to the horrors that are the chaochu─their reach so long that if you can see one, you are already too close. Their teeth so sharp, they can slice through ten-ilm steel like a hot iron through ice. Their breath so bad, it can make a man retch all the way across the Ruby Sea. (Alright, that last one may be an exaggeration, but you get the picture.)


---------------------------------------------------------------------
They Shall Not Want (6981313)

Seeking to strengthen their tribe, a band of Budugan warriors have kidnapped a shepherd of the Mol. Will anyone heed his cries?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Walk Through the Valley (6982851)

The shepherd is free from his bonds, but fight remains in the Budugan warriors who would see the youth theirs. Drive back the attackers as your new charge navigates the steppe back to the safety of his tribe's village, Mol Iloh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Live for the Mettle (6928961)

Having emerged from Bardam's Mettle seemingly having proved his mettle, the doubly proud and triply vicious Manikantha seeks to sate a hunger grown large on the proving grounds. The Mol, sensing that the beast's hunger may take him to their livestock pens─or worse, their yurts─have sent warriors to slay him, and seek any aid a nearby adventurer might provide.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Off Their Yabby (6880945)

The sweet, succulent flesh of yabby tails was so adored by Ala Mhigan royalty, that an area of Loch Seld was cordoned off to farm the crustaceans. With the fall of the city–state, the nets quickly fell into disrepair, allowing the wavekin to escape into the lake proper where they have since multiplied unchecked. Help is sought by local fishers in thinning the yabby population.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Foul Bachelor Frogamander (6954580)

Little scares the Empire, years of conditioning rendering their soldiers rocks in the face of even the worst of odds. For some reason, however, not even the hardest of Garlean commanders will muster the courage to stand against the bloated abomination that is Frogamander─archimandrite of the abaddons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Old Bucket of Boruta (6954595)

Locals say that only after a young maiden─grief-stricken upon learning that her father had promised her to an evil baron─flung herself from Lochwatch did the rogue rafflesia Boruta begin terrorizing the region. Is the seedkin a manifestation of the girl's anguish, or simply a creature invigorated after supping on the girl's spilled humours? Does it even matter? The flower is eating children!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dusk till Abaddon (6954604)

It has been three nights since the fishers of Loch Seld last slept. Three nights of incessant croaking so loud, even a turnip in each ear cannot muffle the noise. Croaking so thunderous, spines tingle and urns tumble from their boards above the kitchen. The culprits? Abaddons. The solution? Steel.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Smell That Leeched Her Heart (6954613)

The aroma leech is an efficient hunter, emitting a soft, pleasant scent that attracts many a skipping maiden, afield in search of pretty flowers to knit wreaths and garlands. Yet what those maidens find is naught but a slow, agonizing death at the sucking maw of a bloodthirsty monster.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tall Tale (6954656)

Ala Mhigan resident Tall Mountain woke this morning with the city watch at his door claiming he was under arrest for crimes he has no recollection of committing. At the same time, a burly, wan-faced Hellsguard appeared in the Lochs, covered from head to toe with blood that did not appear to be his own. Could this impostor be the true culprit?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Taking Kurrea Business (6954697)

Come mating season while all other ninki nankas were caught in the throes of passionless rutting, Kurrea simply used the opportunity to feed, growing larger...and larger...and larger, until he was nigh abursting. Now that there is naught left to consume, he has taken to his second favorite pastime─the slaughter of innocents.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dude, Where's My Karya (6954703)

As is the case with most ambulatory trees, warm, freshly drained lifeblood is what ancient Karya craves, the seedkin trapping its victims in its tangle of roots and branches, and keeping them alive with its own sickly sweet fruit so that it might sup slowly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sisyphus Cooling (6955066)

A heretofore unseen golem has been sighted pushing boulders about nearby caves─caves from whose very walls the beast is believed to have been formed. By whom and for what purpose this lithic monster was given life is unknown, but those who have seen their kin torn in two by the massive creature's claws will tell you this: Sisyphus must die.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Minotaurs on My Mind (6955077)

Until a fortnight ago, many Ala Mhigans believed minotaurs to be naught more than stories told to keep children from exploring the deadly caves surrounding the Lochs. When children began disappearing, people still blamed the caves, boarding their entrances so as to discourage the curious. When a giant minotaur was seen carrying a young Lalafell into the night, however, people finally knew Asterion was real.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dive In (6955079)

So paranoid did the King of Ruin become in his final days, that not a day would go by where servants, aides, cooks─even kin─were not sent plummeting from the Divine Audience to their dooms. It is said that to this day, the Lochs are haunted by restless specters, bound to this realm by their wrath.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pounding Salt (6955083)

Since the Garlean invasion, the Firkins have remained in a state of disrepair─all attempts at rebuilding hampered not only by the occasional salvo of imperial cannon fire, but by the untamed salt anilas who have taken up residence in the crumbling buildings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lalla Land (6955089)

An ill wind blows down from the hills rendering all caught in its path...well, ill. The cause of this unnatural plague? Lalla Mira─a malevolent spirit of wind whose breath carries with it the very air of death.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
When It Pains It Pours (6955097)

Long have scholars postulated as to why soblyns are so aggressive compared to their lowland cousins. One theory is that the corrosion to their metallic carapaces caused by the accumulation of salt crystals causes the creatures constant pain, leaving them in a perpetual state of frenzy. Or, it could simply be they are evil, evil beings.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sob Story (6955106)

A blend of six impurities in its shell have left one soblyn even more strung out than usual. One might leave the creature to its own devices and hope that it learns to live with its pain without further endangering the lives of the smallfolk who call Loch Seld home. Or, one might just put the poor thing out of its misery and hope the Lifestream has a better plan for it next time around.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Par for the Course (6955124)

A hungry fisher once said, “one vepar is never enough.” Said fisher was killed on a half-full stomach by the third vepar he attempted to reel that fateful autumn morning, giving rise to the adage, “a vepar dead is another night safe in bed.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sip When I'm Dead (6955132)

When kaluks cannot locate fresh lifeblood to drink, they take to the potter's fields where they probe the soil for freshly buried corpses. This, unsurprisingly, does not sit well with the relatives of the recently deceased.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Who's Phoebad (6955141)

The salt crystals of Loch Seld make for perfect receptacles of errant aether discharge. When enough aether builds in these formations, it can give them life, but most often it is life in only the simplest sense of the word─driven by the basest of urges: sleep, hunger...murder. The phoebad do not belong on this realm. Send them back whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Yabby Hunters (6955427)

There are those who claim the Loch Seld Monster is no more than a hoax, contrived by enterprising Ala Mhigans to dupe rich foreign emissaries into spending sacksful of coin on excursions to find the beast. There are also those who have been sliced in half by the giant yabby's claws. Those are the true believers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Enemy Territory (6955464)

Territorial disputes amongst the diverse fauna of Loch Seld are as frequent as they are deadly, the latest featuring a school of chelone overtaking the lake bank several ninki nankas called home. Without a place to hunt and nest, the wavekin are moving towards a new territorial dispute─one between the nankas and a small fishing village.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
One Bad Mother Chukwa (6955464)

Weakened by the epic battle that resulted in a large swathe of loch nanka territory being claimed by her school of chelone, murderous High Matron Chukwa is at her most vulnerable. If there is to be any chance of slaying this most foul of lake-beasts, it is now.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Give Bees a Chance (6977377)

Farmers of the Lochs look to the region's many bees and butterflies to help pollinate their meager crops. Sapria look to those same creatures to fill their fathomless bellies. As a sapria is not that satisfying in a salad, the smallfolk have asked that you save the bees instead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
About Face (6955552)

Named for the queen who saw to the construction of the gardens in which it now resides, Creeping Edila is said even to resemble Her Most Royal Highness, albeit before she made her face in the morning.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
No Time Is a Good Time (6955569)

With serrated teeth strong enough to rip apart even twice-plated Garlean warmachina, Serra is a force of nature not to be reckoned with lightly. Only those who favor unlasting glory over near-certain death need test their fortune in a battle of wits with this wavekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazeless Runner (6955591)

A minotaur without a labyrinth is like a dog without a bone─prone to wanton killing sprees that most often end in the annihilation of entire villages. In other words, nothing like a dog without a bone. Slay the minotaurs. Prevent annihilation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Kingsgrave (6955614)

Ancient Ala Mhigan kings believed even after they died, the spirits of fallen enemies would harry them far into the afterlife. To combat this, they had their honor guard buried with them...whether they were dead at the time of the regent's passing or not. Several of those spirits, not overly pleased with the fates thrust upon them, still roam the land with vengeance in their hearts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fate No Morpho (6977377)

A scholar once claimed that a butterfly flapping its wings in Gyr Abania gave rise to the storms that rocked Othard's eastern shores. If that were true, the amount of flapping caused by the royal morphos trying in vain to escape the gaping maws of hungry abaddons will see Doma under ten yalms of rain by moon's end. Just in case, you may want to slay those abaddons.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I Can Feel the Earth Move (6978799)

Dhara feed by draining the soil of its earth-aspected aether, leaving the land brittle and prone to erosion. To prevent deadly sinkholes and landslides, the dhara must be dealt with.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
To Leech His Own (6978806)

Unable to bear the thought of his beloved leeches being disposed of by the Empire, the royal physicker liberated his blood-loving assistants on the night of the invasion by tossing them into the privy where they eventually swam their way out into Loch Seld. And there, for the past three decades, have the wavekin thrived, growing fat on the blood of hapless travelers and foolish children.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tellus a Tale (6978819)

Where Tellus walks, the ground moves─or so sayeth those who swear that the region's recurrent tremors are not, as scholars claim, movements of the land's crust atop rivers of molten rock, but in fact the lumbering gait of a modern-day giant.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, Golem (6978825)

Though the Eorzean Alliance has claimed the Seventh Umbral Era concluded, there are still parts of the realm which suffer the lasting effects of Dalamud's fall. One such area can be found in the mountains circling Loch Seld where aetherial instability engenders mindless golems.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ancelot's Fear (6980759)

The Empire's outlawing of religion in Ala Mhigo has seen sacred sites fall into ruin, those once tasked with their upkeep forced to abandon all labors of faith. As a result, locations such as the royal crypts are now overrun with creatures threatening to defile thousands of years of history.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ancelot's Folly (7005725)

The chants of ceremonies that once assured that restless spirits remained beyond the corporeal realm no longer echo through the royal crypts, allowing specters and ghosts to return to the world of the living unmolested. If allowed to escape the palace halls, it will be but a matter of time before they descend upon the Loch's villages.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ancelot's Finale (6980893)

Unaware of his own death, King Manfred has risen from his tomb to rule once again─or so that is what the evil spirit possessing the rotting corpse of the long-deceased regent wants you to believe.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Departures (6910810)

Having taken from the land all they dare, the Dataqi tribe has broken camp and begun their exodus to a new home. However, not but a few bells from their departure do they spy a cloud of buzzflies─an ill omen whose arrival may spell extreme hardship in the moons to come. Perhaps if the vilekin were slain, the tribe's fortune may yet be preserved.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Distractions (6910812)

As the Dataqi search for a new home, they are hounded every step by literal hounds─steppe gedan who seem intent on following the tribespeople at a distance until their guards are dropped and their bellies exposed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Duty (6910813)

Finally settled in their new home, the Dataqi have returned to their daily routines─one such task being the milking of the sheep. The livestock, however, remain ill at ease in these unfamiliar surroundings, and the tribe's milkmaid seeks assistance in filling the jugs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Deprivation (6954304)

Their rations depleted from the long journey, the Dataqi seek to replenish their supply tents. A herd of wild dzos was spotted near the camp, and its meat could feed the tribe for days─moons, even, if the flesh is jerked.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Deterrence (6954306)

The Azim Steppe has no shortage of starving hounds, and despite having driven off an entire pack during their last exodus, the Dataqi find themselves surrounded by even more steppe gedan─these even more hungry than the last.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Desperation (6954308)

A band of Ugundi warriors drunk on fermented goat milk have begun a charge on the Dataqi camp that, at best, could be called reckless. Still, a reckless charge can at any time turn deadly if not prepared. Send the sotted sods back to the steppe that they may sleep this all off.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Distress (6954309)

The tribe has come across a hunter in dire need of aid, having bitten off far more than she can chew in her ill-fated attempt to bring down a mammoth by herself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Displacement (6954310)

Any time a new camp is built, the first and foremost task is to clear the area of any wildlife that might pose a threat to the tribe's livestock. To secure this particular location, a pack of gulo gulo must be dealt with swiftly and cleanly, as not to attract any further predators.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Diplomacy (6954313)

As if to say “you are not welcome here,” Matanga have descended upon the Dataqi settlement, bent on tearing each and every tent to shreds. It may be time to strike camp and move on, but before doing so, the current threat must be quelled.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Decimation (6954314)

The slaughter of their brethren has sent the remaining Matanga into a fit of unbridled fury. No longer content with driving the Dataqi people from their territory, the Matanga now seek the death of the tribe's every last man, woman, and child.

The Dataqi Chronicles: Divergence (6954316)

Sounds of fighting in the distance compel the Dataqi nomads to stop and scout ahead, where they find a band of Goro warriors in a heated battle with a party of savage Matanga. Join the scouts in aiding the Goro in their plight.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Declarations (6954317)

Not ones to forgive or forget, a Matanga war party seeking vengeance for their fallen brothers has emerged from the steppe, weapons drawn. There will be no surrender, only death. To which party is yet to be decided.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Dataqi Chronicles: Dominion (6954318)

In a final act of desperation, the crestfallen Matanga plead to their almighty regent, Anjana, for one last boon─to descend from the heavens and vanquish the Dataqi and Goro tribes once and for all. The true trial of the steppe begins...and ends...here!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Summer of Ultros (7021351)

The beautiful female faire-goers are under attack by the lewd Ultros and his uncontrollable tentacles. Fight the fiend off to defend their honor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
To Bait a Baiter (7021352)

A merchant of deplorable morals is attempting to sell his bait at an outlandish price. Defeat the merchant's bodyguards to defend the fair market.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Snippers Gonna Snip (7021353)

A hungry pack of snippers has caught the scent of a delivery of fish bound for the faire kitchens. Protect the fish crates from the Moonfire snippers, so that faire-goers can indulge in the bounty of the sea.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Adopt a Beach (7021354)

Refuse left by faire-goers has ruined the scenic beaches of the isle. Gather the Moonfire Faire rubbish and deliver it to the faire chaperone.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad Luck Comes in Trees (7104423)

The thieving treants must be stopped without damaging the decorations. Pepper them with starbursts to force them into submission.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Mochi Catastrophe (7105181)

The neko bugyo has unleashed a horde of vicious yet oh-so-adorable─but mostly vicious─gaelicats on the mochi pounding site. Adventurers retrieving advent cakes from the mortar will have no time for pussyfooting around, lest they fall prey to the cyclops's hammer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Mochi Catastrophe (7105197)

The neko bugyo has unleashed a horde of vicious yet oh-so-adorable─but mostly vicious─gaelicats on the mochi pounding site. Adventurers retrieving advent cakes from the mortar will have no time for pussyfooting around, lest they fall prey to the cyclops's hammer.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Swarm Never Sets (7171390)

More than twice the size of a Hyur male and at least as pestilent, the Emperor of Anemos has arrived to defend his empire against encroaching adventurers. The murderous look in his compound eyes will soon suppress any guilt you feel over this entirely avoidable situation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wail in the Willows (7189420)

The wind howls with voices of those long dead, heralding the advent of the high voidsent, Pazuzu. Weather the winds he wields, lest your own screaming soul be added to the chorus.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Color My World (7235800)

The Songbirds have taken the stage! Speak with the royal handmaiden to get dressed and join the show!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wine and Honey (7236597)

As the old saying goes: every wyrm's ending is just a voidsent wyrm's beginning. Banish this particularly vicious example, and remember that no one's to blame—except the adventurers that killed the high dragon whose dying breath summoned forth this monstrosity.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unsafety Dance (7236915)

Scattered flower petals adrift on the wind may calm the mind and soothe the soul, but being showered with needles detracts from the experience. Best halt Sabotender Corrido's frenzied dance before someone loses an eye.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Teles House (7236918)

Thought to have abandoned the realm for more accommodating climes, imagine the surprise of the expeditionaries surveying Eureka when they found themselves halfway down the gullet of the legendary (killer) songbird, Teles.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prove Your Amemettle (7236925)

Amemet knows that one doesn't become an apex predator by being selective about his meals. He devours any creature that he can bite, tear, or bludgeon to death, including other carnivorous dinosaurs, and is now poised to eat Eureka out of island and ecosystem.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Caym What May (7236941)

Slaying a massive carnivorous scalekin may seem the end of one's troubles, while in fact, it is just the beginning. That corpse left rotting in the forest is the perfect means for an aether-starved voidsent to worm its way into our realm...and start killing again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Killing of a Sacred Bombardier (7236954)

Hyperbole can be employed to suggest that the stench of rotting goobbue seven days dead is enough to kill a man. If that rotting goobbue, however, is being used as a vessel for a voracious voidsent host, then the need for hyperbole is no more.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sing, Muse (7236981)

Polyphemus is proof positive that fame and an enlarged cranium need not go together. Be that as it may, his large torso, large club, and large dinner parties (which only occasionally end with him devouring the guests, but are always terrible) are reason enough to extend him no hospitality.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Drama Lamashtu (7236279)

The hells have no fury like a woman scorned. They are, however, home to many a dead woman scorned, whose fury is possibly worse. The voidsent queen Lamashtu would know, since she's the bloodsucking demon who killed them all. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Short Serket 2 (7239240)

There is nothing worse than a marsh teeming with thousands of scuttling scorpions...except a marsh teeming with thousands of scuttling scorpions *and* their giant queen.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I Amarok (7237077)

When commanding an army of voidsent abominations on a campaign to quell a world of its light, two heads are always better than one. Luckily for Amarok─dread wolf of the deepvoid─he has three.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Mat (7243960)

Once known to his loyal subjects as King of the Flame, for years Hazmat has wallowed in the lightless void, unable to wield his brilliant, fiery magicks. Now, unbound from the darkness, the self-proclaimed regent is free to set the world alight...literally.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Simurghasbord (7244739)

After its avian prey was snatched right out of its beak, this ravening predator began a merciless hunt for anything—or anyone—it might carry away and devour. Proceed with caution, as surely a fowl foul enough to cannibalize other birds would have no qualms about downing a Lalafell or two. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
When You Ride Alone (7236992)

Don't be fooled by his choice of attire. Come from the void to aid his hungry brethren in their quest to consume this realm's aether, the White Rider is a deadly beacon for the forces of darkness. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
One Missed Callisto (7255002)

If a bear falls victim to mind-controlling spores in the woods, does it make a sound? Judging by the bestial roars echoing across the isle each night, the correct answer would be “yes.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Disinherit the Wind (7256101)

One might imagine wind spirits as gentle, if capricious, wanderers. The best cure for such delusions is to witness the wildly territorial Jahannam's overblown reaction to the disruption of wind currents encircling its domain.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't Judge Me, Morbol (7309739)

Upon discovering her seedbeds rendered barren by man's savage sickles, Julika─ancient tangle of root and vine─has sworn vengeance on those who would dare slash her spawn. And her first step? To reseed the earth with a new army of loyal sprouts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
By Numbers (7309744)

A wicked puppetmaster's abrupt disappearance from this plane has left his insentient servant free to wreak whatever havoc its mechanical mind can muster.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Shadow over Anemos (7309747)

For all that we know of him, the Lord of Anemos may seek simply to protect his subjects. Alas, his ever-gaping maw reveals no secrets, only impossibly sharp teeth. However noble his intentions, he is a threat as great as any other when he approaches with undulating tentacles aloft.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Color My World (7235800)

The Songbirds have taken the stage! Speak with the royal handmaiden to get dressed and join the show!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Color My World (7235800)

The Songbirds have taken the stage! Speak with the royal handmaiden to get dressed and join the show!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eternity (7388966)

Long thought a convenient fiction dreamt up by the negligent parents of missing children, the Snow Queen has at last deigned to descend from her icebound throne─to visit punishment upon those who have dared stain her immaculate land with roseblooms of blood. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cows for Concern (7388968)

Years in the wilderness have served only to intensify Surabhi's resentment of the treatment her herd endured in a livestock pen. Well, that and sharpen her feral instincts enough to make her a veritable killing machine.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ash the Magic Dragon (7388970)

Ever discontent to frolic in the autumn mist like other, less sinister scalekin, the Ash Dragon would smother the world in pursuit of ambition if given the opportunity. Indeed, with his voidsent army's ranks depleted, he already seeks new hosts for his cohort of conquerors.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conqueror Worm (7388979)

Myriad are the horrors spoken of the Glavoid─of its enigmatic origin in the unexplored reaches far beneath, and how the very land crumbles around it. Also, it's a giant worm. Best drive it away before it steals the sanity from passing researchers, or just disgusts them profoundly.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Melting Point (7388985)

“When snow melts, what does it become?” The optimistic might answer “spring,” the cynical, “water.” Sojourners to Pagos, however, will inform you that it becomes Anapos, a fearsome sprite with as little mercy as the elements themselves.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Disorder in the Court (7388986)

Given that his claim to fame is having a visage so grotesque as to boil rivers─and their inhabitants─by mere proximity, it is hard to believe that any would worship Asag, let alone call on him in their time of need. But some do, and they have, so here he is.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Does It Have to Be a Snowman (7388989)

A rolling stone may gather no moss, but it does gather snow and, occasionally, a form of sentience that allows for lasting grudges against those who have mistreated it. It would be highly unfortunate if several such stones were to meld together and rampage across the land in the name of vengeance. Highly unfortunate. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brothers (7388991)

Any sensible adventurer is prepared for the fearsome eventuality of turning a corner only to come face-to-face with a minotaur. Alas, few consider the possibility of coming face-to-faces with *two* minotaurs. Beware these bullish brothers' unbreakable bond.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye of Horus (7388993)

Look to the sky! It's a bird! It's─ No, it's definitely a bird. One with sun-haloed wings and a heart burning with hatred, come to deliver a scorching reprimand unto his subjects' murderers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Morte Arthro (7388994)

Woe betide an invader in this land of many kings. The latest to heed the call of his beleaguered people is the noble King Arthro, leader of knights round...and clawed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Apocalypse Cow (7388995)

Among the wild bulls of Eureka dwells one with a lion's heart, he that would be the herd's savior from the scourge of man. Expedition researchers, threatened with trampling whenever they leave camp, have dubbed him the Holy Cow and taken to exclaiming said title as if it were a mild profanity.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Third Impact (7389083)

Some creatures live unusually long lives by identifying potential predators and avoiding confrontation. Some do so by obliterating all comers with a storm of fire and lightning called from the heavens. Hadhayosh is of the latter sort. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Eye Scream for Ice Cream (7389130)

Unsurprisingly, Arch Angra Mainyu misses none of its surroundings─meaning that, upon its summoning, it immediately located the band of mortals responsible for murdering its voidsent brethren and vowed to take an eye for an eye.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Louhi on Ice (7390545)

Logic would dictate that killing the undead makes little difference to their overall situation. The voidsent Louhi─and his lethally sharp pair of ice blades─begs to differ.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cassie and the Copycats (7390553)

Many a naturalist has questioned how a morbol so rarely exposed to warmth or sunlight could have grown even more enormous and replete with limbs than the Shroud's Capricious Cassie. As none have been willing to approach her so-called copycat to find out, the official answer remains “by being an unholy abomination, probably.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wobbler in Darkness (7390976)

It is said that she who overcomes the Hakutaku with the beast's eye cluster in hand shall be rewarded with gold and glory─not to mention nights free of worry that an amorphous mass filled with an ever-increasing number of eyeballs is roaming the land, undulating ever nearer her bedside.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Down the Rabbit Hole (7390999)

A group of capricious happy bunnies fancying a portable refuge from the frequent snows of Pagos have found their plot to filch several straw hats foiled, and themselves outnumbered. They would surely feel indebted to whoever keeps them from becoming dinner for the yukidama and their not-so-fun-loving guardian, Voretooth.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Curiouser and Curiouser (7404346)

Nothing if not ambitious, the happy bunnies of Pagos aim ever higher─both figuratively and literally─with their mischief. Their attempt to steal crystals from the brows of local decotituses has obviously not gone to plan, and they are in need of rescue lest they be crushed underfoot.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cairn Blight 451 (7517539)

A voracious collector of eldritch tomes in life, Taxim appears loath to let his current less-than-fresh state impede him in continuing to wrest ancient and forbidden manuscripts from their hiding places, no matter the consequences.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: A Giant Undertaking (7541192)

A hulking voidsent has forced its way into the city. Strike down the creature known as Benandonner and return it to the aether whence it came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: All Ogre It (0)

Fearsome voidsent have forced their way into the city. Strike down these ogres known as deepvoid slaves and return them to the aether whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Toothsome Terrors (7541194)

Fearsome voidsent have forced their way into the city. Strike down these savagely sweet beings and return them to the aether whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Comprehensive Training: Double Trouble (0)

Both voidsent hordes and imperial forces are threatening to overrun the city. Engage the invaders and strike them down to the last man, monster, and machina.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-imperial Training: No Van's Land  (0)

Menacing imperial warmachina have breached the city walls. Engage the H-1 vanguards and reduce them to scrap metal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-imperial Training: A Pinch of Assault (7541197)

Imperial assault troops have breached the city walls. Engage the enemy and strike them down to the last man and machina.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-imperial Training: Strike Out (7541199)

Imperial strike troops have breached the city walls. Engage the enemy and strike them down to the last man and machina.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-imperial Training: Strike Out (0)

Imperial strike troops have breached the city walls. Engage the enemy and strike them down to the last man and machina.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Free-for-Ul'dah (7544488)

Fearsome fiends and voidsent have forced their way into the city. Strike down these creatures and rid Ul'dah of their existence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Doom and Gloom (0)

An enormous voidsent and its minions have forced their way into the city. Strike down the creature known as Gloom Eye and return it to the aether whence it came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Premium Cuts (0)

Fearsome voidsent have forced their way into the city. Strike down these gargoyles known as deepvoid butchers and return them to the aether whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Blood from Stone (7544490)

An enormous voidsent has forced its way into the city. Strike down this gargoyle known as Baraqiel and return it to the aether whence it came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Undead Ahead (7544492)

A horde of undead voidsent has forced its way into the city. Strike down these fell beings and return them to the aether whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Joint Training: The Quick and the Undead (0)

A horde of undead voidsent has forced its way into the city. Together with the Immortal Flames, strike down these fell beings and return them to the aether whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: Soul of Destruction (7544493)

Fearsome voidsent have forced their way into the city. Strike down these ghostly beings known as deepvoid souls and return them to the aether whence they came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-void Training: A Void at All Costs (0)

A veritable army of voidsent has forced its way into the city. Stand your ground and beat back the raging horde.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-fiend Training: Less Is Morbol (7569546)

A malodorous morbol is wreaking havoc most foul in the city. Strike down the creature known as Cirrate Christelle and rid Ul'dah of its rancid existence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
It's Aliiive (7586192)

Likely as much to its confusion as everyone else's, this year's Heavensturn mochi has miraculously sprung to life. Best not to think about any latent moral implications as you hack it into delicious bite-sized pieces.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Medias Res (7610695)

Hearken not as her chilling soprano weaves its harmony with the cries of the fallen, for Leucosia forever seeks new patrons to sweep away to her isle of corpse flowers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
High Voltage (7611350)

Come to relish the burning atmosphere, Flauros has no qualms about striking twice with his many, many lethal edges. Due to the dangers of approaching him from any angle whatsoever, expedition research has been suspended until such a time as the beast is grounded.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
On the Nonexistent (7611407)

Accustomed to a captive audience and prone to taking a distinctly hands-on approach toward dissenters, it seems that the Sophist and his pupils will stop at nothing to ensure silence reigns wheresoever he chooses to impart his forbidden knowledge.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Creepy Doll (7611424)

Now that her former owner is no longer warm and breathing, Graffiacane seeks new playmates to join in her games. Forever and ever and ever.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Quiet, Please (7611428)

Some would believe long overdue books are written off and forgotten, but the librarian─he remembers. He always remembers. And when damage comes to library materials, Askalaphos comes to collect.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Up and Batym (7611560)

With all manner of demonic powers at his clawtips, Grand Duke Batym is unused to inconvenience. Thus it was with some annoyance that he awakened from his abyssal slumber to find mortals cutting their way through the ranks of one of his thirty legions.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rondo Aetolus (7611565)

With the local competition reduced to aether, the opportunistic Aetolus has crowned himself heir to a particular expanse of Pyros. This would be unworthy of note were he less prone to conducting unpredictable and often lethal symphonies of levin in his territory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scorchpion King (7611567)

At times, it is a comfort to know that looks can be deceiving─particularly when one is looking at a hundred-barbed scorpion. In Lesath's case, said looks conceal the fact that his tail not only stings, but also manipulates fire-aspected aether, so...not so much.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Burning Hunger (7611581)

Much like their cousins the yeti, Eldthursar's preference for certain climatic conditions limits their choice of habitat─a situation not improved by their territorial nature. Thus is anyone found blithely culling an Eldthurs's available foodstuffs unlikely to escape unsinged.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dry Iris (7611589)

As the old fishwives' tale about dropping a lightning crystal in the bath cautions, some energies just don't mix. So it was with a great deal of shock both metaphorical and literal that expedition naturalists stumbled upon Iris, wandering alone and friendless far from her natural habitat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thirty Whacks (7612753)

Lamebrix Strikebocks, dubbed “the Survivor” by his mercenary crew, is known for his tenacity in all things─whether it be staring down rivals at the gamblers' table, or avenging his underlings' murders. He is *not* known for his mercy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Put Up Your Dux (7613119)

According to naturalists, Dux does not merely hold power over thunder and lightning, but in truth is a manifestation of the storm itself. The same scholars assert that the question of why the storm's incarnation need be quite so horrible to gaze upon is better left to theologians.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
You Do Know Jack (7613162)

Wheresoever the Weeping Willow goes, the ravenous Lumber Jack is never far behind. And as they are, respectively, a disgruntled tree with destructive tendencies and an insatiable, murderous insect, neither is particularly good for the local environment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mister Bright-eyes (7613525)

Some may consider it odd for a cloudkin to be one of the finest battlefield tacticians the world has ever known. This would be a poor use of time, as Glaukopis does not typically afford one the opportunity to consider for long.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Haunter of the Dark (7613713)

Primary sources on Ying-Yang are scarce, as no scholar who has personally observed the twin-creature yet retains the ability to speak any known tongue. A scribbled line in now-sealed research records states only that “they arise from the space 'tween light and shadow.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavens' Warg (7614757)

Oft does a wolf call to the moon and receive only the chill howl of the wind in reply. In rare cases, however, answer comes in the form of Skoll, eyes scornful and maw hungering for the soft flesh of man.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lost Epic (7614763)

The gathering of moths to the flame has drawn forth the irresistible Penthesilea─but though the voidsent warrioress may stoke the passions of mortal hearts, she has made plain that naught will satisfy her burning desire but glorious death on the battlefield.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-imperial Training: A Pinch of Assault (7541197)

Imperial assault troops have breached the city walls. Engage the enemy and strike them down to the last man and machina.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Counter-fiend Training: Less Is Morbol (7569546)

A malodorous morbol is wreaking havoc most foul in the city. Strike down the creature known as Cirrate Christelle and rid Ul'dah of its rancid existence.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
We're All Mad Here (7669653)

Whether their urge to snatch coral from atop wandering snippers should be attributed to their zeal for irritating other fauna or a simple attraction to bright colors is unclear, but the fact remains that the happy bunnies have angered an impressive number of the creatures in doing so. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncommon Nonsense (7670685)

Despite the likelihood that they have─again─done something to deserve their fate, only a monster could ignore the plaintive whimpers of distressed happy bunnies encased in stone. Though their gaolers will be none too pleased, they must be liberated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Like Clockwork (7687175)

Mechanical soldiers have been sighted in the vicinity of the Unholy Heir. Join forces with Noctis to vanquish these menaces from another world.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I Ink, Therefore I Am (7796814)

Perhaps having seen one too many cephalopods harvested by expedition members for later salting or frying, a particularly large specimen has taken to brutalizing any who so much as lick their lips in its vicinity. As such, those who refer to Khalamari by its nickname are advised to do so quietly. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
From Tusk till Dawn (7830374)

Even be it ages old and half-fossilized, a stegodon never forgets its enemies─those who hunt its kin looming large among them in its memory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bullheaded Berserker (7833243)

Gruesome was the campaign brutal Molech and his band waged across western Hydatos, until their sole weakness─allergies─brought it to a screeching halt. With the pollinators responsible dead, however, swift and decisive action will be necessary to thwart his reign of terror.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mad, Bad, and Fabulous to Know (7844555)

If anything can be said to command more pity than the flightless bird, it surely is the flightless flock being hacked to bits by uncaring adventurers' blades. Thus is pity the charitable motive ascribed to Piasa by expedition naturalists─though some have seen it admiring the contrast of blood against its colorful plumage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fearful Symmetry (7833262)

Having slain his way through the felines of his home continent, besting each in single combat to hone both muscle and instinct, Frostmane struck out to seek fiercer tigers on which to sharpen his claws. But if his chosen prey is absent, its slaughterers will do.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crawling Chaos (7834716)

Wisps of blood curl across water's surface, drawing Daphne with its sweet scent. Though the face that she, he, *it* wears be not its true visage, nor Daphne its true name─merely a whisper that comes unbidden to the minds of those who gaze upon it─remember: some truths are better forgotten.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Duty-free (7835320)

Guided by the sweet symphony of suffering souls, King Goldemar has emerged from the void with an eye toward trade with our realm. Lord of smithies he may be, but accept neither his wicked works nor his curse-forged coin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Leukewarm Reception (7827644)

After consuming a great many nutritious voidsent with its assorted jaws, Leuke proceeded to set its sights on attracting a veritable army of pollinating insects so that it might grow even larger. It is evidently not best pleased to see their ranks thinned.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Robber Barong (7837264)

Despite being more earthfire than beast at this point, the lord of lionkind still feels kinship with his subjects. He will see them avenged, even should all the world burn to ash.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stone-cold Killer (7844584)

Ceto's handmaidens─and only they─are as children to her, so it ought to come as no surprise that their murder would set her shaking, slashing, and spearing with rage. Other things one should avoid being surprised by include the reach and lethality of her assorted limbs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Baldesion Arsenal: Expedition Support (7829339)

Despite being sealed in the tower, one of Eureka's transcendent weapons has managed to forge creations of its own by transferring to each a portion of its essence. Needless to say, all must be eliminated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Crystalline Provenance (7833066)

Upon attempting to clear loose crystals away from an unusually large formation, expedition scholars were intrigued and alarmed─mainly alarmed─to discover a live dragon. None know whence it came or wherefore it is so full of rage...though one naturalist did admit to having poked it in what might have been its eye.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I Don't Want to Believe (7811742)

A source of major aetherial disruption throughout Eureka has been found nestled amidst the isle's protean currents. Though the creature's nature has yet to be identified, its capacity for destruction is clear.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Drink Me (7829448)

As a brief respite from their mischief-making, Eureka's happy bunnies have opted to take refreshment at a nearby stream. Alas, it is a simple matter for victims of their shenanigans and creatures to whom they look like tasty snacks to find them at such a popular watering hole, and they will require saving once again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Where Has the Dagon (7936799)

Teushs Ooan is on the trail of the monstrous Archaeotania, but his search has been interrupted by a horde of roaming dagons. Without your help, these foul creatures will tear the intrepid Ondo limb from limb.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ondo of Blood (7945698)

A faction of Ondo led by Zumshs Aath Deepdread are plotting to use Archaeotania for their own nefarious purposes. Bringing down the ringleader should put paid to their wicked plans, at least for the time being.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Lookin' Back on the Track (7945699)

In his pursuit of the dreaded Archaeotania, Teushs Ooan has located more tracks that he believes were left by the beast. Since it is nigh on impossible to do anything in the Tempest without being swarmed by ravenous predators, the young Ondo would benefit from having someone to watch his back as he investigates the mysterious marks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Coral Support (7945700)

Teushs Ooan aims to lure Archaeotania into the open with sanguine coral, which can be found in large quantities in a nearby cave. As one might expect, it is rife with dangerous beasts, and it falls to you to keep the reckless Ondo from becoming their next meal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Low Coral Fiber (7945701)

Having arrived at the inner reaches of the cave, Teushs Ooan prepares to gather sanguine coral. The presence of carnivorous clionids makes the task a rather dangerous one, so he suggests that someone more battle savvy go in his stead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nothing Like a Trappin' Life (7945702)

In the midst of setting a trap for Archaeotania, Teushs Ooan is set upon by the underlings of the infamous Zumshs Aath Deepdread. Hopelessly outnumbered and outmatched, the brave young Ondo will surely perish unless someone can come to his aid.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Head, the Tail, the Whole Damned Thing (7945703)

Drawn by the scent of sanguine coral, Archaeotania finally shows itself. The time has come to end its reign of terror once and for all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Devil in the Deep Blue Sea (7945704)

Of all the flesh-eating clionids of the Tempest, Halimede is one of the most feared. She is known for lulling her prey into a false sense of security with her soft whimpering, before drawing close and skinning them alive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Seashells He Sells (7945705)

Mewshs Laan is hoping to gather shells in Purpure, and as luck would have it, the cavern he has chosen is full of predatory nauplii. Unless he is accompanied by a capable bodyguard, he is sure to be torn to shreds by the highly aggressive gastropods.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pearls Apart (7945706)

The clutchmother has once again lived up to her name by producing the latest in a long line of Ondo. To celebrate the occasion, her people hope to present her with the finest pearls the Tempest has to offer, though their skill in gathering them leaves much to be desired, and they would benefit from your assistance. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
My Friend's Enemy Is Anemone of Mine (7945707)

A horde of deep-sea anemones has been devouring every morsel of sea life they can fit into their maws, which does not sit well with the inhabitants of the Cups, who are being deprived of their usual fare. The sooner this nuisance is eradicated, the sooner the locals can return to eating normally. Normally by Ondo standards, at any rate. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nets Best Thing (7945708)

Few denizens of the deep are more of a nuisance than the aptly named danbania netcutters. Ondo fishers would go to great lengths to rid themselves of these aquatic menaces, including requesting the aid of outsiders. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hydrozoan of the Enders (7945709)

Many Ondo believe that hydrozoans are the reincarnations of those who have drowned at sea. While this may be naught more than superstition, the fact that these hideous creatures pose a threat to ocean-dwellers great and small cannot be denied, and keeping their numbers low is essential to maintaining the natural balance of the Tempest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Lot to Swallow (7945710)

The Ondo have kept swallows as a form of aquatic livestock for many generations, and feed them constantly to ensure they grow as large as possible. However, several have escaped and returned to the wild and are now playing havoc with the food chain by devouring far more than their fair share.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Natural Prawn Killers (7945711)

Mantis shrimp have gathered en masse to spawn the next generation of voracious predators. Should their brood be allowed to infest the Tempest, they would devour everything in their path, like a swarm of aquatic locusts.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Barking Mad (7967766)

The Singing Bows have tracked down a group of echoes that have become unnaturally aggressive after contracting a strange disease. It threatens to spread throughout the Greatwood unless it can be nipped in the bud.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Creepy Crawlers (7967767)

After investigating the remains of diseased echoes, the Singing Bows discover that they were infected by crawlers that had wandered into the Greatwood. Their solution, as always, is to cull the beasts before they can do any more harm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pluck of the Draw (7967768)

The Singing Bows go through rather a lot of arrows in their line of work, and they are in need of tarichuk feathers from which to make more. Although tarichuks occasionally molt here and there, it will be much quicker to simply slaughter an entire flock and pluck them from their still-warm corpses.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The End of the Sentry (7967769)

The ancient guardian has patrolled the forests since the days of the Ronkan Empire. It seems, however, that some of the more depraved denizens of the Greatwood have taken umbrage with the stony protector and seek to end its watch once and for all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil War (7967770)

The Singing Bows find themselves in a hard-fought battle with one of the greatest threats the Greatwood has ever faced: the monstrous Tojil. With their arrows bothering it little more than bee stings, they will need all the help they can get if they are to stand a chance of slaying this gargantuan predator.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Annihilation (7967771)

Though the Singing Bows were able to repel Tojil's onslaught, the creature is far from defeated. They will need to press the advantage and slow the beast's movements to prevent it from escaping again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Annihilation (7967772)

Though the Singing Bows were able to repel Tojil's onslaught, the creature is far from defeated. They will need to press the advantage and slow the beast's movements to prevent it from escaping again.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Carnage (7967773)

Sensing that the Singing Bows have gained the upper hand, Tojil withdrew to another part of the forest in order to recover its strength. The pain it has suffered at the hands of the woodland guardians has only strengthened its resolve to slaughter each and every one of them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Carnage (7967774)

Sensing that the Singing Bows have gained the upper hand, Tojil withdrew to another part of the forest in order to recover its strength. The pain it has suffered at the hands of the woodland guardians has only strengthened its resolve to slaughter each and every one of them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Eclipse (7967775)

Tojil prepares to make one final stand against the Singing Bows, who are determined to end the beast's reign of terror, no matter the cost. Now that the creature is cornered, its desperation makes it all the more deadly, and it lashes out wildly, blinded by rage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll Be Bark (7967753)

The Night's Blessed thought they had seen the last of Chantico when they set it ablaze. To their horror, it has returned, more abominable than ever. Their attempts to quell its rampage have met with little success, though your timely intervention may help to turn the tide.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
We Are Venom (7967755)

Speckled spiders bred by the Children of the Everlasting Dark for their venom have escaped from their keepers. Allowing the creatures to run amok in the Greatwood would have disastrous repercussions, so they must be eradicated without delay.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Picking Up the Pieces (7967756)

Urns that once contained poisonous substances have been abandoned by the Children of the Everlasting Dark and have since been shattered. Pink flamingos have taken to ingesting these fragments, presumably to aid their digestion, and threaten to spread disease throughout the Greatwoood. To minimize damage to the local environs, these perilous pieces of pottery must be disposed of posthaste.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Six Fulm Turkeys (7967757)

A pack of particularly hungry-looking atrociraptors has descended on the Greatwood. Their voracious appetites mean it is only a matter of time before they turn their attention to the residents of Slitherbough.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dark Matters (7967758)

A contingent of the Night's Blessed are fighting a losing battle against the Children of the Everlasting Dark. A massacre is about to take place, unless some brave soul can intervene.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack of the Killer Tomatl (7967759)

As if regular tomatls were not enough of a bother, an especially large one is making a nuisance of itself by grabbing any who stray too close to its tendrils. Reducing it to a fine purée should put a stop to its mischief.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Queen of the Harpies (7967761)

A huntress of Fanow has barely escaped with her life from the impossibly grotesque and immensely powerful Kelaino. The stricken woman of the Greatwood entreats you to slay the monstrous bird before it can wreak any more havoc.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nest of Kin (7967762)

A horde of gizamaluks are preparing to nest in the Ronkan ruins, though they have reckoned without the intervention of the Singing Bows. The forest guardians are willing to use to any means necessary to keep this sacred ground from being defiled by these foul creatures.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeying Around (7967763)

Wood raiders have snuck into the Ronkan ruins and have made off with several artifacts. The defenders of the ancient treasures are, as one might imagine, displeased that they have become the playthings of these dastardly simians, and go about reclaiming the relics, prizing them from the thieves' dead paws if necessary.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shot Through the Hart (7967764)

Qilmet is teaching her protégé, Salmet, the ways of the huntress by bringing down moving targets. However, she may yet be unprepared in the event of said targets defending themselves, so Qilmet requests that you accompany her student, on the off chance that the training go awry.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Attack the Block (7967765)

The Eye of Gatorl was created to keep intruders from entering the Ronkan ruins, but has, for reasons unknown, begun venturing far beyond the confines of the ancient temples. The Singing Bows are determined to deactivate the rogue sentinel before it can endanger the lives of innocent forest dwellers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Foes Most Formidable (7970690)

A poor engineer of the Tholls has been set upon by a band of unruly Goggs and their unrulier iron constructs. Save the man of middling mass from this moot of metallic mauling.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Family Most Formidable (7970680)

You chase down the unruly Goggs only to run into a gaggle of their kith and cousins all bent on bleeding you dry. Dispatch the uninvited guests that you may sit down for a quiet heart-to-heart with the original crew.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Finale Most Formidable (7970673)

It appears that the Goggs have been secretly engineering a massive new automaton capable of thwacking and throttling on a scale heretofore unheard of. Put an end to the malevolent machina by doing a little thwacking and/or throttling of your own.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadow over Stilltide (7970530)

Sick of seeing the fruits of their hard work hooked by harrying hobgoblin hooligans, the fishers of Stilltide have taken up arms against the crooked cracksmen. However, at the end of the day, they are but humble men and women of the sea, and could use a helping hand for one more seasoned in the art of fisticuffs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadow over Stilltide (7970637)

Sick of seeing the fruits of their hard work hooked by harrying hobgoblin hooligans, the fishers of Stilltide have taken up arms against the crooked cracksmen. However, at the end of the day, they are but humble men and women of the sea, and could use a helping hand for one more seasoned in the art of fisticuffs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wright Stuff (7970654)

The people of Wright have had their fill of hobgoblin malfeasants raiding their fields, and a handful of their hardiest have pledged their sickles and hoes to hammering some hamlet justice into the hobbies' heads...though, they would not turn away any offers of assistance in their noble endeavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wright Stuff (7970659)

The people of Wright have had their fill of hobgoblin malfeasants raiding their fields, and a handful of their hardiest have pledged their sickles and hoes to hammering some hamlet justice into the hobbies' heads...though, they would not turn away any offers of assistance in their noble endeavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bitter Barley (7970122)

A flock of thirsting rails has descended upon the barley fields of Kholusia, and it appears the birds are not only thirsty, but also extremely hungry. Protect the crates of recently harvested grain and the livelihoods of those who maintain the fields.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
JELL-NO (7970196)

There is nothing like a warm breeze softly blowing off the summer seas...except when upon those winds are borne untold thousands of free-floating jellyfish looking to wrap their tingling tentacles about anyone and anything.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Roadside Dinner (7970231)

Soon after her eggs hatch, mother tragopans begin the process of teaching her young where they might find their prey. Unfortunately for the people of Kholusia, this most often involves leading the fledglings to busy thoroughfares where the young birds might dine on weary travelers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
One-punch Mantis (7970268)

Not content with pummeling every creature in the sea into silent submission, a school of jumbo mantis shrimp have strolled ashore seeking a little set-to with the heedless settlers of Kholusia. Drub some sense into the crabby crustaceans quick and send them packing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Knockout (7970410)

Knockers will eat most anything, but given a choice, they will sup on the scraps of metal sloughed off by wild calxes. This iron-rich diet, however, has the unfortunate side effect of sending the knockers into a frenzy that oft ends in blunt force trauma for any and all nearby parties.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Season of Our Discord (7970456)

Whereas most modest monsters are not ones to toot their own horns, the calxes of upper Kholusia do nothing but, blasting a cacophony of strident screeches and unharmonious honks from dusk until dawn with little cease. The dwarves who call these mountains home are in need of someone who might help see them silent once and for all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Amity Village Horror (7970468)

Amity's storage chests rarely store anything on account of their contents constantly being plundered by pilfering persons─if one might call a hobgoblin a “person”─which they most certainly are not. The settlement's residents have sought help in the past to solve their hob-problem, but alas the chests still lie bare. Though, perhaps this time will be different!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Not Today (7970011)

What crawls along the ground, leaving naught but death in its wake? If you guessed Crawling Death, you would be correct. You will also be dead...unless you slay it first!


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ironbeard Builders - Rebuilt (7970820)

To complete his automaton, a crafty engineer of the Tholl family seeks the aid of errant travelers to help him collect prismatic ore─an item he could quite possibly procure himself, but has refrained from ever since taking an oath to “work smarter, not harder.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ironbeard Builders - Resist (7970830)

The Tholl engineer has completed his pièce de résistance, and now seeks the assistance of kind-hearted gluttons for punishment to learn if his piece can resist their blades.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ironbeard Builders - Revolt (7970843)

Ever the conniving coots, the Goggs, discontented with bringing but a single shiv to this knife fight, have instead brought a drawerful, greatly skewing the odds in their favor. It will be up to you to even, nay tip, the scales back.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Frog Standard (7978503)

Given their own willful nature, to annoy a pixie is no small feat. The Daen twins seem to be managing it, however. Someone really ought to intervene before matters escalate and innocent bystanders are magicked into shrubbery...or worse.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Daens (7978504)

The Daen brothers get along famously─with each other, of course, not anyone else─in large part due to their shared hobbies. This would be heartwarming, did said hobbies not include setting elder gliders upon innocent amaro.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuath of Habit (7978505)

The fae penchant for mischief covers everything from harmless pranks to active cruelty, and none are less likely to make any sort of distinction between the two than the Daen twins, who have now chosen to harry a hapless herbalist.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Back and Fuath (7978506)

Piquing the Daens' curiosity is never, strictly speaking, a *good* idea, but interfering with their mischief is a sure way to do so. Thus has the interference of martially inclined wanderers and one very tenacious pixie prompted them to devise a fantastical means of testing their would-be challengers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brute Fuath (7978507)

Once they find a suitably entertaining pastime, the Daens are loath to let it go. Instead, they prefer to raise the stakes─or at least their stature.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Breaking the Fuath Wall (7978508)

For the next round of bloody sport, the Daens have elected to work in tandem─if not as themselves. If you can't beat 'em...at least keep them occupied.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Go Fuath a Conqueror (7978509)

Still transparently enjoying the conflict, the Daens have donned their most ferocious guise yet. Intimidating as this may be, to show hesitation will only encourage them─fearless engagement is the only option.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuath to Be Reckoned With (7978510)

In a final gleeful gambit, the Daens have transformed themselves into a hulking behemoth. Perhaps indulging them one last time will satisfy their desire to revel in chaos.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mad Magic (7995785)

Through a magical process that might charitably be described as “experimental,” several pixies have created a psammead of unusual size. And murderousness.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bear Necessities (7978493)

A sleuth of rosebears have come searching for sweet morsels of sheep flesh. Drive them off before they decimate the pixies' domesticated flock.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Weave 'Em and Weep (7978497)

In an unfortunately all-too-common case of pixie magic gone wrong, a simple pollination spell has resulted in the abrupt and excessive proliferation of flower baskets. They will need to be culled before any further breeding occurs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Locus Terribilis (7978498)

The irismoth Necropsyche has come to feast on the sweet nectar of Il Mheg's flowers─which would be a tolerable state of affairs if she weren't a *giant* irismoth. As it is, she stands to drain all the area's blossoms of liquid and life before she has finished breakfast.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Twice Upon a Time (7978499)

A land of eternal spring is all well and good, but it does come with the ever-present possibility of being menaced by bees. This is, in fact, why gathering nectar is one of the less popular assignments a pixie can receive, and help would doubtless be appreciated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hedge Mazed (7978500)

A few hapless souls in search of medicinal herbs have entered pixie territory, and are now in danger of being permanently transformed into ornamental shrubbery. While doubtless hilarious to the fae residents of Il Mheg, this is probably not in the mortals' best interest.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Thrice Upon a Time (7978501)

As if the feral anemones and murderous bees weren't enough, a vicious bird of prey has descended upon the nectar-seeking pixie. They can, of course, take comfort in the fact that all of this will make for an amusing fireside tale─assuming they survive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Once Upon a Time (7978502)

The sweet nectar of Il Mheg's blossoms is coveted by many a species, not excepting the aggressively territorial anemone─an unfortunate reality that the pixie charged with collecting this moon's supply of the stuff is now discovering firsthand.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Looming Nightshade (7963400)

Nightshade has begun preparations to establish a stronghold in ruins nearby the Crystarium. The self-styled renegades are far too volatile to be considered anything but an active threat, and Crystarium forces require assistance in discouraging this endeavor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Creeping Nightshade (7963409)

Nightshade has begun preparations to establish a stronghold in ruins nearby the Crystarium. The self-styled renegades are far too volatile to be considered anything but an active threat, and Crystarium forces require assistance in discouraging this ambition.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Draconian Measures (7928822)

Scouts have watched the approach of Ophion─he who respects no territorial bounds and brooks no rivals─with great concern. With him now in such proximity, the Crystarium guard has no choice but to strike first, lest the city become his next bloody hunting ground.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cry Not Wolf (7961922)

Though the wargs born to serve the Shadowkeeper's fell purpose have long since cast off the chains of that fate, they resent what remains of mankind quite as much as did their erstwhile master, and are eyeing the Forest of the Lost Shepherd as a venue to vent their ire. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pick-up Sticks (7963411)

The efforts of a logger come to harvest timber for vital construction in the Crystarium have been stymied by territorial triffids. For an experienced hero, however, retrieving the fallen lumber should be as child's play.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Flowering Nightshade (7963764)

For those whose modus operandi is active immorality, the more innocent the victim, the better─which is perhaps why Nightshade renegades see fit to harry a hapless botanist. As said botanist would likely prefer to remain in one piece, additional assistance would not go amiss.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Subtle Nightshade (8024335)

Disguised as humble merchants in need of succor, Nightshade instigators have lured Crystarium guards into a snare that will, like as not, turn deadly without outside intervention.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Toxic Nightshade (7928723)

Nightshade has ensconced itself at the Stay, now preparing to stage a full-scale insurrection against the “fool's prison” which they consider the Crystarium to be. Assist the city guard in quelling its ambitions before its violence can take hold.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Deadly Nightshade (8024337)

In its newfound duress, Nightshade has turned to forbidden magicks to impress wargs into its service. The renegades' goal, however, remains as it always has been─to sow blood and chaos.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Economic Peril (7961949)

An unfortunate reality of trade is the need to convey goods through the wilds between settlements. An even more unfortunate one is that merchants set about doing so make appealing snacks for ravenous dracones.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't Feed the Gremlins (7963410)

There is some debate as to whether gremlins truly believe the vitriol they spew, or simply get satisfaction from riling their victims. In either case, it's common knowledge that the best option is not to engage─but pummeling them is by far the more satisfying one.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Beast among Men (7962199)

Once upon a time, Lugarhoo traded obedience to the Shadowkeeper for the power to rend his foes with tooth and claw. Now freed from that pact, it may appear that little remains of the elf he once was─but, in truth, the thirst for violence was always at the heart of him.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Gate of Horrors (7963413)

Most varieties of plant, when in bloom, tend toward fevered pollination. Annoying, to be sure, but no true threat. The ya-te-veo, on the other hand─the ya-te-veo gets *hungry*.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Behind Anemone Lines (7963762)

Though little in this world smells worse than sun-ripened fish, sun-ripened fish that's spent any amount of time near malodorous anemones certainly qualifies. Those who would prefer not to have their noses opened to a whole new world of stench had best assist the local fisher in rescuing his catch before it's too late.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Calm a Chameleon (7993174)

Though the fisher's catch has been preserved in an at least semi-edible state, it unfortunately transpires that violence against anemones causes them to release foul pheromones in even greater quantities. Nussknacker does not appear best pleased by this befouling of its territory.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scavengers Hunted (7936466)

Exactly what Rhal Ral and Darmal expect to scavenge in this part of the desert is unclear. It is abundantly obvious, however, that they will fall victim to the horde of ambushing scissorjaws unless someone intervenes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Reptilian Roadblock (7936544)

After discovering an ancient map, Rhal Ral and Darmal follow a trail that supposedly leads to treasure. However, a pack of hungry lizards bars their way, and Darmal will be hard-pressed to slay them all by himself.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cactus Makes Perfect (7951537)

The treasure map leads Rhal Ral and Darmal into the territory of the towering Cuijatender. Undaunted by this formidable adversary, Darmal rushes headlong into battle, although it will take more than a few swings from his axe to fell this fiend.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Theft from Above (7970646)

Rhal Ral and Darmal finally lay their hands on the treasure only to have it snatched away by the terrifying Offscoursman. The pair of scavengers have tracked down the gargantuan bird in the hope of retrieving their hard-earned prize.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sand and Deliver (7951390)

Rhal Ral leads you and Darmal on a detour, and unwittingly stumbles across a man in the midst of being liberated of his possessions by bandits. Darmal springs into action despite being hopelessly outnumbered, in the hope that you too will enter the fray.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
This Time, It's Personal (7951393)

Despite already having been given a severe drubbing at the hands of Darmal, the bandits have regrouped to launch another attack. However, the axe-wielding scavenger is showing signs of fatigue, and the disadvantage in numbers may be too great to overcome.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Armadillo Peccadillo (7951395)

Ingi leads Rhal Ral and Darmal to the site where the fabled Elderblade is said to lie. Unfortunately, the ruins of Kelk are now overrun with particularly aggressive armadillos, which must be eradicated before the search for the ancient sword can begin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Elderblade (7951398)

The Elderblade that Rhal Ral seeks is controlled by ancient Nabaath magicks, and it now wanders aimlessly, slaughtering any that cross its path. Only by vanquishing the hideous manifestation of the maester's will can the spell be broken.

Harbingers of Bloom (8035993)

Gigantenders often wander beyond their usual haunts when flowering season is upon them. For the people of the Red Serai, the presence of additional obstructions on the road to Mord Souq is most unwelcome, and they are offering handsome rewards for their disposal.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pray Destroy the Waking Sands (8035994)

Ngozi driftmakers entrap their prey by creating patches of quicksand. These diabolic desert dwellers must be destroyed before they can claim any more victims.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tolba No. 1 (7936425)

A creep of tolba have found the perfect spot to lay their eggs, and think nothing of smashing down the tower of Snitch to reach it. This ancient outpost may be reduced to rubble unless someone can stop the stampeding scalekin.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bayawak Attack (7951435)

The dreaded Bayawak and her spawn have descended on Amh Araeng like a swarm of scaly, big-headed locusts. Unless some brave soul can slay the mother and send her brood into hiding, they will strip the land of its precious natural resources.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bloody Simple (7951461)

The arid desert conditions have led dryland iguanas to seek alternative means of relieving dehydration, namely, bathing in the blood of their unfortunate victims. Perhaps it is time that someone returned the favor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Baddie Longlegs (7951499)

Long-legged terrors are a species of flightless, predatory bird that specializes in kicking its prey into deep ravines before climbing down to feast on the remains. Traveling merchants who would prefer not to be splattered across the bottom of some canyon have offered a reward for the culling of these avian menaces.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Odd Couple (7951433)

A pair of creatures of entirely different species have come to the conclusion that two beasts are better than one and are now cooperating in their pursuit for prey. These crafty predators pose a threat to anyone foolhardy enough to wander into their hunting ground.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Anti-eruption Measures (7951432)

Amh Araeng is already prone to rockslides and cave-ins without the intervention of exploding huldu, who seem to delight in mayhem and destruction. If their rampaging is allowed to continue unchecked, they are sure to cause immeasurable damage to the surrounding landscape.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's Dance (with Swords) (7951403)

Dancing weapons once served the Nabaath, but their former masters long since departed, they are now free to do as they please. The enchanted swords choose to spend their days merrily frolicking in the desert and dismembering innocent passersby, much to the annoyance of the people of Amh Araeng.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Carnage (7967773)

Sensing that the Singing Bows have gained the upper hand, Tojil withdrew to another part of the forest in order to recover its strength. The pain it has suffered at the hands of the woodland guardians has only strengthened its resolve to slaughter each and every one of them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Carnage (7967774)

Sensing that the Singing Bows have gained the upper hand, Tojil withdrew to another part of the forest in order to recover its strength. The pain it has suffered at the hands of the woodland guardians has only strengthened its resolve to slaughter each and every one of them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Tojil Eclipse (7967775)

Tojil prepares to make one final stand against the Singing Bows, who are determined to end the beast's reign of terror, no matter the cost. Now that the creature is cornered, its desperation makes it all the more deadly, and it lashes out wildly, blinded by rage.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Great Daens (7978504)

The Daen brothers get along famously─with each other, of course, not anyone else─in large part due to their shared hobbies. This would be heartwarming, did said hobbies not include setting elder gliders upon innocent amaro.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Fuath of Habit (7978505)

The fae penchant for mischief covers everything from harmless pranks to active cruelty, and none are less likely to make any sort of distinction between the two than the Daen twins, who have now chosen to harry a hapless herbalist.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Back and Fuath (7978506)

Piquing the Daens' curiosity is never, strictly speaking, a *good* idea, but interfering with their mischief is a sure way to do so. Thus has the interference of martially inclined wanderers and one very tenacious pixie prompted them to devise a fantastical means of testing their would-be challengers.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mochi that Ate Vylbrand (8160822)

Long thought devoured after the previous turn of the heavens, the celebratory mochi turned monster from the Far East has returned. Does it crave revenge? The flesh of unsuspecting Lalafells? It won't matter if you manage to slice it into delectable morsels.

A Cluckin' Catastrophe (8312635)

The Dreamers' precious chickens have flown the coop, placing this year's Hatching–tide in grave peril. Procure a rabbit suit from the helpmeet, then use sticky birdlime to slow their frantic flapping before seizing them and returning them to their rightful home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabbits in a Row (8283027)

The highlight of the Hatching–tide festivities draws nigh! Join your fellow revelers to bring joy in the form of lovingly decorated eggs to the children of Gridania.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bombard vs. Shark (8402347)

A two-tonze shark threatens summer's most beloved celebration, and it falls to the most graceful adventurers to help combat it. Inspire the Bombard to explosiveness with the flame dance, that it might drive this predator back to its mossy lair.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sneak & Spell (8371396)

A unit of imperial mages has weaved their way across the battlefield and is now dangerously close to Utya's Aegis. They must be repelled before they can strike at the Resistance outpost.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
None of Them Knew They Were Robots (8371349)

The IVth Legion has deployed a detachment of unmanned warmachina with one simple objective: wreak as much havoc as possible.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Beasts Must Die (8371397)

Hernais the Tenacious has a pack of trained beasts at his beck and call in addition to being a formidable opponent himself. His assault on Utya's Aegis must be halted at all costs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unrest for the Wicked (8371431)

Scouts report that an enemy patrol has halted to rest in an easily assaulted position. Seize this opportunity to thin the imperials' ranks.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
More Machine Now than Man (8371432)

The IVth Legion's advanced magitek soldiers are a terrifying amalgamation of man and machine. The Resistance's front line will surely suffer heavy losses if these hulking menaces are allowed to continue their rampage unabated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Can Carnivorous Plants Bloom Even on a Battlefield? (8371434)

Drawn by the literal heat of battle, a host of blooming snapweeds has taken to feasting on hapless combatants. While your allies in the Resistance would be more than pleased if they were to thin the numbers of imperials, these voracious seedkin pay little attention to which faction they are devouring.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seeq and Destroy (8371435)

Daguza, known not-so-affectionately as “Hamshanks” by his peers, has gained a reputation as a fearsome beastmaster. He and his horde will need to be eliminated to make way for the Resistance troops.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
All Pets Are Off (8371395)

The imperial centurion Clarricie is known not only for her prowess in battle, but also for her collection of bizarre pets. Unfortunately for the Resistance, these creatures happen to be incredibly ferocious and hungry for warm flesh.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Conflicting with the First Law (8371436)

Not only has the Empire excavated an ancient automaton, they have repurposed it for combat. While the Ironworks engineers would surely like to study it more closely, they will have to wait until after it has been smashed to pieces.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Brought to Heal (8371438)

A detachment of conscripted mages led by Dyunbu the Blessed has been making a name for themselves as a particularly troublesome group of foes, least of all because of their commander's gift for healing. While the attacking of chirurgeons and other medics is generally frowned upon, her presence on the front line can no longer be tolerated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Monster Mash (8402954)

Hernais the Tenacious and his menagerie are poised to strike at Olana's Stand. They must be repelled before the Resistance outpost is overrun with fiends.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Red (Chocobo) Alert (8371394)

Daguza's collection of beasts includes the incredibly dangerous red chocobo. They are able to call forth flaming meteors with alarming accuracy, a far cry from other, more amicable breeds.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unicorn Flakes (8371393)

A summoner formerly in the employ of the Empire has decided to cut her ties and flee with an experimental creature. The Resistance has taken pity on her and the poor beast and has arranged for their escape, though as one might expect, imperial pursuers are not far behind.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Parts and Recreation (8402961)

The imperials are using the battlefield as a testing site for the latest magitek weaponry. The Resistance would put a stop to these experiments and gather as many pieces of Garlean technology as possible for their research into the enemy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Element of Supplies (8371447)

The imperial forces are planning to establish a refueling and repair station for their warmachina. They have even gone so far as to leave their supplies out in the open, though not entirely undefended.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Heavy Boots of Lead (8371448)

The Resistance had previously defeated an ancient automaton, only for it to reappear with improved combat capabilities. There is no telling the havoc it will wreak if left to its own devices.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
No Camping Allowed (8402962)

Dyunbu the Blessed and her troops have struck camp in a position of strategic significance, obstructing the advance of the Resistance. A swift assault should send them packing, opening a path for your allies.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Scavengers of Man's Sorrow (8371450)

Voidsent are invariably drawn to sites where blood is spilled, that they may feed on the aether of those fallen in battle. Though this poses as much of a threat to the Empire as it does the Resistance, the front line cannot advance until these fiends are eliminated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Help Wanted (8371451)

A Resistance unit has found itself swarmed by imperial forces. Without aid, they will surely be overwhelmed.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pyromancer Supreme (8371452)

An influential centurion─and powerful pyromancer─has arrived to chastise the Resistance. Snuff Sartauvoir's flame before all are consumed in fiery devastation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Waste the Rainbow (8372099)

Clarricie has brought several of her exotic pets for a leisurely stroll on the battlefield, and possibly to slay a few Resistance troops for good measure. Worst of all is her so-called “Feathered Rainbow,” which is not only a voracious predator, but offensively gaudy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Wild Bunch (8372101)

With their master having been slain in battle, a pack of trained beasts now roams the southern front, ravenously devouring anything unfortunate enough to draw too close.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
My Family and Other Animals (8372103)

Despite Daguza commanding an impressive assortment of beasts, he is not opposed to bolstering his ranks with more sentient beings. Your Bozjan allies strongly recommend ignoring his attempts to recruit you and simply pummeling his hideous face instead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a Mechanical Man (8371392)

Once more, the ancient automaton has taken to the battlefield, deadlier than ever. Your Resistance allies can but hope it is still within their power to defeat it.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Murder Death Kill (8372107)

The Empire's magitek-enhanced soldiers continue to harry the Resistance's front line. A unit led by Dabog, the magitek-enhanced pilot, poses an immediate threat to your Bozjan allies and must be eliminated at all costs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Desperately Seeking Something (8372110)

A number of imperial soldiers have been seen attempting to excavate an unknown object from the battlefield. Whatever it may be, it likely spells trouble for the Resistance, so they must be prevented from locating the prize they seek.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Supplies Party (8372111)

An imperial detachment has been sighted transporting supplies across the battlefield, and the Resistance aims to requisition these valuable resources for themselves. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Demonstrably Demonic (8372097)

As the battle intensifies, so too does its power to draw forth fell creatures from the void. A horde of archaeodemons has descended upon the southern front, laying waste to all in their path.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
For Absent Friends (8371391)

The imperial mage detachment led by Dyunbu the Blessed has joined with other units after their previous defeats. Though some common ground may yet be found between their leader and the Resistance, it seems that for the time being, conflict is unavoidable.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Of Steel and Flame (8371391)

As the Resistance prepares to strike directly at Castrum Lacus Litore, the way is barred by both Sartauvoir quo Soranus and Sicinius mal Vellutus, two of the deadliest opponents to grace the southern front. Though the elite members of Gunnhildr's Blades have entered the fray, even their considerable strength may not be enough to emerge victorious.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Let Slip the Dogs of War (8372118)

The subordinates of Hernais the Tenacious have unleashed their hounds to maul any Resistance troops that draw near to Castrum Lacus Litore. Your task is to send them running with their tails between their legs.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The War Against the Machines (8372098)

It appears there is no end to Sicinius mal Vellutus's magitek monstrosities, as yet more of his unmanned warmachina take to the field. With each of his creations deadlier than the last, the Resistance will be hard-pressed to repel them without your aid.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Spiders brought in from the Yafaem Saltmoor have broken free of their transport crates, and are now following an instinctual urge to return home. With great power comes great culpability, so it falls to you to subdue these arachnid escapees.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hills Are Alive (8977762)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bite the Pellet (8977764)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner (8977765)

Luncheon toads. Luncheon toads everywhere. Left unculled, these creatures will breed and spread far beyond their designated habitat. And no one needs to eat *that* much toad meat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Let It Grow (8977767)

A sample of snow brought back from the frozen north contained a tiny specimen of sentient algae, which has suddenly awoken from hibernation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Acid in Flight, Shepherd's Fright (8977768)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Incident Files: Elemental Attraction (8956818)

The energies of an elemental reactor appear to have caught the attention of a batch of experimental arcane creations. With disaster in the offing, the time has come to bring an end to this study in living crystals.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Incident Files: Ice of the Tiger (8956826)

A different batch of experimental creatures has succeeded in absorbing energy from a nearby reactor. Now charged with elemental ice, the entities have inexplicably evolved to resemble large feline predators. Break these crystalline cats before they go on the hunt.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Residual Complications (8977769)

Aetheric residue from an elemental reactor has crystallized into solid entities of mindless violence. Needless to say, their presence makes for a hostile working environment.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Moisture Farming (8977770)

A researcher with smooth and supple skin is casting an appraising eye over the nearby soma. It would seem that today's keyword for sample collection is “moisture.”


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Wasted XIV (8977771)

Wastewater with a high concentration of aetheric energy should never be allowed to flow near an elemental reactor. There are several gelatinous reasons why, and all of them unwelcome.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Empty the Nest (8977772)

A group of ore-based life-forms has established a nest too close to the reactor for comfort. As a simple “please leave” is unlikely to be effective, the colony must be eradicated.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Frailty of Life (8977773)

A berkanan grown to gigantic proportions is depriving the surrounding flora of sufficient nutrients. Reduce it to kindling for the greater good.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheaves on the Wind (8977774)

As this vexed researcher discovered, it is wise to keep a strong grip on one's stack of confidential documents when walking near tempestuous storm anilas...


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Devout Pilgrims vs. Daivadipa (8876668)

Hearing the prayers of pilgrims, a deity has descended─albeit a false one from the Tower of Zot. This pretender to the name of Daivadipa must be consigned to the aether whence it came.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Full Petal Alchemist: Risky Return (8957550)

On the way home from picking flowers, the alchemist Sajabaht was accosted by fiends lured by the sweet smell of the blossoms. Fend off the vicious rasayana so that the woman might return home in peace.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Devout Pilgrims vs. the Jungle Lizards (8957665)

Separated from his fellows, a pilgrim has run afoul of hungry jungle lizards. Though the man's faith is strong, so too are the lizard's snapping jaws, and a helping hand would not go astray.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Peek-a-Bhujamga (8957278)

It's all fun and games until someone wanders into poisonous bhujamga territory, as a group of children accidentally did while playing in the jungle. The vicious reptiles must be put down lest the little ones come to harm.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stalkers in the Shroud (8957279)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mesmerizing Moths (8957281)

A swarm of illumoths bred for their enchanted scales has escaped captivity. They must be put down before they can bewitch the locals─or be used as an excuse for indiscreet behavior.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Return of the Tyrant (8957282)

Valin, the ill-tempered baboon king said to have been banished by Saint Agama, has returned to continue its rampage. The tyrant must be deposed once more if peace is to reign in the jungle.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeys on Your Back (8957283)

A maiden out gathering herbs has attracted the attention of the worst sort of hanuman langurs─salivating ones. The mischief-makers must be driven off if the maiden is to obtain what she needs to treat her wounded father.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Devout Pilgrims vs. the Apalala (8957637)

A band of pilgrims cannot reach their destination on account of deadly apalala having moved in. Fervently do they pray for the way to be cleared─and a good old-fashioned culling should do the trick.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Artificial Malevolence: 15 Minutes to Comply (8964439)

Ebrelnaux of the Ironworks has clambered aboard an imperial warmachina, only for it to spring to life with him inside. The chance of rescuing him is to bring the machine to a crashing halt.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Artificial Malevolence: The Drone Army (8964448)

Ebrelnaux once defected from the Empire, and he now returns to his former home as a member of Garlond Ironworks. His investigation into Garlemald's latest magitek weaponry has taken a dangerous turn, so it falls to you to save him from the technology he once helped create.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Trespassers Will Be Eaten (8953327)

The search for sustenance has brought a wandering herd of ovibos into close contact with the survivors of Garlemald, who, in addition to wanting to defend their territory, also have designs on the meat of these beefy brutes.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Snowball's Chance (8953331)

Despite appearing to be comprised largely of snow, the bizarre snegovik requires warmth much like any other creature. The ceruleum pipelines, for whatever reason, give off a certain amount of heat, which attracts snegoviki. There is concern, however, that allowing them to huddle around the pipes will raise the temperature to dangerous levels, so they must therefore be driven off to prevent a potential explosion.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Not Yeti (8953341)

Like its cousin the yeti, the almasty is vicious, opportunistic, and built like a brick shitehouse. To top it all off, they smell like an abattoir on a hot day, which may prove something of a distraction as you set about slaughtering them en masse.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nettle Gear Solid (8953295)

With all the recent goings-on in Garlemald, the sudden appearance of poisonous icetraps resulted in little more than a raised eyebrow. Nevertheless, someone needs to keep the fiends at bay, and you are as good a candidate as any.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Roses Are Red, Violence Is Due (8953349)

The barren ice fields of northern Ilsabard are home to a surprising assortment of hostile flora, and none are more ferocious than the roselike Heliogabalus. This botanical behemoth is capable of devouring anything it can fit in one of its multitude of maws, and given its immense size, that encompasses just about every creature on the continent.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazing Crates (8953358)

Survivors of the civil war have excavated several days' worth of valuable provisions from the rubble of the capital. Unfortunately, they did not have the foresight to store the supplies beyond the reach of inquisitive beasts such as the jotnar, and it will take more than a bit of shouting and aggressive hand-waving to deter them.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Artificial Malevolence: Unmanned Aerial Villains (8964468)

The magitek that Ebrelnaux once helped create has taken on a life of its own. He intends to analyze the latest Garlean automated weaponry, but in order for him to carry out his investigation, you must first render these machines inoperative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Artificial Malevolence: Mighty Metatron (8964468)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Rocker, Roller, Out-of-controller (8953384)

Squadrons of magitek monstrosities once patrolled the streets of Garlemald to scare the citizenry into driving safely. Now, with no one to oversee them, these roaders now charge about the city attempting to mow down anyone foolish enough to cross their path.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Stray Dog Strut (8953390)

Deprived of their masters, these slavering hounds roam the ruined capital in search of fresh meat, and they are anything but fussy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Exterminate, Exterminate (8953405)

This horde of automated magitek weaponry was already a menace when under the command of its creators, and now that the machines' programming has been overwritten by some unknown malefactor, it no longer distinguishes between friend and foe. For the sake of your allies and Garlean survivors alike, you must eliminate this threat with all due haste.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Bit of a Problem (8953458)

Levitating, autonomous drones known simply as “bits” were deployed in great numbers during the Garlean civil war. Since the end of the hostilities, some enterprising miscreant has modified their targeting parameters, and they now mercilessly stalk any living thing that dares enter the imperial capital.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Man with the Golden Son (8953410)

The much-lauded magitek engineer Seneca poured his heart and soul into the creation of this gargantuan, bipedal warrior. He even went so far as to name it after himself, as a father might a son, in the hope it would carry on his legacy long after his passing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Parts Unknown (8953420)

Throughout the ruined capital, small pockets of survivors salvage what they can to help stave off the cold. One such engineer has ventured outside in search of parts required to restore power to his friends' temporary home, but with masterless magitek on the loose, he is in desperate need of your help.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Lepus Lamentorum: Crazy Contraption (8981410)

In a surprise to no Loporrit who knows him, Fallingway is betrayed by his “greatest creation” and now enlists your aid in silencing the malfunctioning miscreant.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mantids on the Moon (8954545)

Though the moon is rather lacking in native fauna, what little that resides there is in danger of being annihilated by a swarm of rampaging trimmers. Their serrated appendages and powerful mandibles more than make up for their unintimidating name.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
One Giant Weep (8954539)

A group of curious lunar life-forms has begun their migration. Loath though you are to put down such pitiful creatures, their spread must be stopped.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Cactus What You Preach (8954546)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Strolling Stones (8959470)

Sentient─and incredibly violent─regoliths have wandered over from the far side of the moon, and are attempting to make Mare Lamentorum their new home. For the sake of its current inhabitants, it is best to send these craggy creatures back whence they came.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Taking Care of the Caretakers (8954560)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Head Empty, Only Thoughts (8954576)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
What a Thrill (8954593)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ophion-mania (8953015)

An inadvertent profusion of invasive ophions is proving deleterious to the environment. The time has come to put things right─for the sake of the star, naturally.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rustling of Murderous Leaves (8953028)

A monstrous variety of yggdreant has set upon a researcher who meant only to observe them. Bring your woodcutter's axe to bear and get to hacking.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Butterfly Kisses of Death  (8953036)

A murder of phantom phanopsyches has descended, and they've a taste for flesh. Now, it's either kill or be killed─and you would rather be doing the killing, like as not.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
You Hurt My Researcher, Prepare to Die (8953091)

Meletos the Inscrutable is at it again, only this time a great deal calmer. He seeks one who might test his latest and greatest creation: the primordial kyklops.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad Breath in Paradise (8953095)

The clean, serene spring, which many a creature relies upon for fresh water, has been befouled by morbol marchionesses who have claimed it as their own. You won't stand for that, now will you?


---------------------------------------------------------------------
King of the Hill (8953096)

Two territorial creatures─the delirious melanioi and the Elpis minotaurs─have begun something of a turf war. Only violence can end this struggle for dominance.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Why Did It Have to Be Medusae? (8953097)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Omicron Recall: Comms Expansion (8995240)

Omicron N-6205 seeks to recover data from an earlier model known as Chi. Establishing a connection, however, will require the collection─or creation─of copious scrap material with which to augment its transceiver.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Omicron Recall: Secure Connection (8995245)

Transceiver successfully augmented, N-6205 now moves to establish a connection with the Chi unit. It requires time, however─time uninterrupted by the overflow units operating on a contradictory protocol.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sound and Fury (8957522)

Sorrow begets anger. Anger begets violence. Even amongst brothers does this cycle of loss perpetuate itself, unto the end of time...or such time as a more powerful foe arrives to end their suffering once and for all.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
(No) Wind beneath Our Wings (8957520)

Far from the Madding Horde (8957518)

Though Than Oskh may not be the most tragic figure cast to bitter winds in the wake of war against the machines, he is one of the most fearsome. If his senses cannot be restored, he must be stopped─ere he guides his horde to crush what few signs of life yet linger in their forsaken home.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dead Inside (8957541)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Nevermore (8957565)

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Omicron Recall: Killing Order (8865314)

Unit N-6205 has successfully established a connection with Chi─which has arrived with offensive protocols fully primed. It would seem that the only way to retrieve its data is to defeat it in combat.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Happiness Is a Warm Bunny (9082915)

The happy bunnies that are so indispensable─probably─to this Hatching–tide season have made mortal foes of the equally indispensable─presumably─local chickens, and now run rampant in the Twelveswood. Wade through a flock of furious hens to capture the fluffy mischief-makers and ensure the festivities proceed as planned.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't Be Sylphish (9556018)
