A young maiden, full eager to\u2500</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000050</h1>\n\n<p>Wherefore inquirest thou of her fairness!? Very well. Be she damsel or devil, I shall direct her steps to Revenant's Toll.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000060</h1>\n\n<p>...Save thine insinuations for one given to such impropriety. Thou shalt not find me amenable.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000070</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Far across the sea, from the land of Doma, have we traveled. We seek audience with the ruler of these lands. Who here speaks for you?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100010</h1>\n\n<p>We have traveled some several thousand malms across the sea, from the nation of Doma, in hopes that we might find sanctuary in these lands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100020</h1>\n\n<p>Sanctuary, Lady Yugiri?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100030</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. Lying within Othard, Doma was under the dominion of the Garlean Empire, as I am sure you are aware.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100040</h1>\n\n<p>When the war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we espied an opportunity to free ourselves from the yoke of imperial oppression, and took up arms.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100050</h1>\n\n<p>...Only to be crushed. And so I gathered what few Domans escaped the reckoning, and guided them hither to your shores.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100060</h1>\n\n<p>A war of succession...? Then the Emperor... Forgive me, you said that Doma \u201cwas\u201d under imperial rule, did you not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100070</h1>\n\n<p>Doma is gone. Razed to the ground as an example to the other provinces.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100080</h1>\n\n<p>Twelve have mercy... And your people?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100090</h1>\n\n<p>On a ship anchored in Vesper Bay, flying borrowed colors.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100100</h1>\n\n<p>Many were complicit in the rebellion, or are kin to those who were. They will not come ashore until I send word that it is safe to do so.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100110</h1>\n\n<p>I sought an audience with your rulers, but was summarily refused.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100120</h1>\n\n<p>The lords of Ul'dah are not wont to entertain foreign refugees without suitable encouragement.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100130</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap I was foolish to expect otherwise. But our supplies run low, and we have young ones in urgent need of care.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100140</h1>\n\n<p>I have seen the tents outside the gates, however. We are not the first to seek asylum, nor will we be the last.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100150</h1>\n\n<p>...Be that as it may, Ul'dah is no friend to Garlemald. Your tale would stir the hearts of many men and women here.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100160</h1>\n\n<p>The sultana and the Syndicate will not be so easily swayed\u2500but I shall see that you are granted an opportunity to plead your case.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100170</h1>\n\n<p>This is within your power?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100180</h1>\n\n<p>Well...far be it from me to boast, but I do have the ear of certain influential individuals.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100190</h1>\n\n<p>I am in your debt.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100200</h1>\n\n<p>Lady Yugiri, forgive me for observing, but...your choice of attire seems like to evoke feelings of mistrust.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100210</h1>\n\n<p>Men are wont to fear the unfamiliar. We know this from experience.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100220</h1>\n\n<p>We seek only to spare the people of Ul'dah unnecessary disquiet.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100230</h1>\n\n<p>I shall defer to your experience, then.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100240</h1>\n\n<p>I thank you for your understanding.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100250</h1>\n\n<p>It seems I have urgent business with the Flame General. I leave our guests in your capable hands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200000</h1>\n\n<p>I, Yugiri of Doma, am honored to meet you at last, Your Grace. To mark this auspicious occasion, I should like to present to you the finest treasures our humble nation has to offer...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200010</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, the circumstances which have brought me here today have divested me of both time and dignity. I come before you as a pauper in direst need of aid\u2500to request that you grant my people asylum.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200020</h1>\n\n<p>I, Nanamo, seventeenth in the line of Ul, welcome you to our city. Be at ease, Lady Yugiri.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200030</h1>\n\n<p>Although I myself have heard the tale of your misfortune, I would ask that you recount it once more for the benefit of the others here present.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200040</h1>\n\n<p>As you wish, Your Grace. For many years, my nation, Doma, suffered under the yoke of imperial rule, and my people yearned to be free. Thus, when a war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we sought to take advantage of the chaos and reclaim our liberty.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200050</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, our enemy proved less preoccupied than we had hoped, and our rebellion was put down in the most brutal fashion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200060</h1>\n\n<p>Those who survived\u2500how many do they number?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200070</h1>\n\n<p>More than two hundred souls huddle within the cramped confines of our own galleon's hold. Yet this figure accounts for but one of a number of ships which escaped the purge.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200080</h1>\n\n<p>It is my hope that you will allow us all to dwell within your walls. Should that prove unfeasible, however, I humbly ask that you accept as many of my people as your resources allow.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200090</h1>\n\n<p>Pray understand, we do not beg a boon, but propose instead an arrangement. We would serve\u2500as soldiers or tradesmen\u2500until our debt is repaid.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200100</h1>\n\n<p>What are the Syndicate's opinions on this matter?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200110</h1>\n\n<p>I, for one, think it's a marvelous idea. Lady Yugiri and her people strike me as an industrious lot, and there are parts of the city which have yet to be fully restored. If they are willing to work, I see no reason not to let them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200120</h1>\n\n<p>The head of the Mirage Trust is not known for his generosity. He sees profit in this.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200130</h1>\n\n<p>I agree. That said, these are foreign refugees. To admit them would require a formal resolution. Shall we call a vote?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200140</h1>\n\n<p>The law is the law.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200150</h1>\n\n<p>Lord Lolorito?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200160</h1>\n\n<p>Tell me: are you blind or willfully ignorant? Even now, our streets are choked with the displaced victims of the Calamity and Ala Mhigan refugees.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200170</h1>\n\n<p>They live hand-to-mouth, subsisting on aid provided by the Immortal Flames\u2500the cost of which grows ever higher!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200180</h1>\n\n<p>The wealth of Ul'dah is not without limits, my friends.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200190</h1>\n\n<p>And need I remind you that these refugees are prone to violence and criminal activity? You have all read the reports, I think?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200200</h1>\n\n<p>Without homes or employment, it is only a matter of time before men grow desperate and take that which they imagine has been unjustly denied them. Yet, knowing this, you would have us swell their ranks. Mayhap you think the Brass Blades and the Flames are not hard-pressed enough?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200210</h1>\n\n<p>Some say the chairman of the East Aldenard Trading Company passes gil thrice daily. This may explain how he came to be the wealthiest man in Ul'dah. Or it may simply be that he's ruthless beyond reckoning.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200220</h1>\n\n<p>Surely the sultanate can support the few hundred Domans Lady Yugiri represents? That our resources have been taxed I do not deny, but we are hardly in danger of financial collapse.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200230</h1>\n\n<p>I move that an exception be made.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200240</h1>\n\n<p>An exception, Your Grace? I am suddenly reminded of a similar debate some years ago, regarding a number of Ala Mhigan refugees, if memory serves.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200250</h1>\n\n<p>What were your words that day? Ah, yes: \u201cThe law is the law.\u201d And so our visitors remained in Little Ala Mhigo.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200260</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap our wise and benevolent sultana would be so good as to enlighten us as to which other of our laws should not be upheld?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200270</h1>\n\n<p>Mind your tongue, Lolorito.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200280</h1>\n\n<p>My lord, I share your concern for the welfare of our great nation, but we must endeavor to take a longer view. You know as well as I that people can be a resource still more precious than gil.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200290</h1>\n\n<p>Precious or not, they were never yet so reliable. And unlike those who frequent your establishment, I have no desire to gamble with my future.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200300</h1>\n\n<p>Ul'dah's greatest asset is, and has ever been, her material wealth. We risk this at our peril.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200310</h1>\n\n<p>One need only look to Teledji Adeledji's example for evidence of the danger in allowing sentiment to dictate policy.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200320</h1>\n\n<p>How far the vaunted Mirage hath fallen, both in repute and profitability, since he began employing refugees...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200330</h1>\n\n<p>How I choose to conduct my affairs is not your concern, my lord!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200340</h1>\n\n<p>A proposal has been tabled. Given its urgency, I move we forgo further debate and call a vote.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200350</h1>\n\n<p>To accept the Doman refugees or not. Those in favor, I bid you remain. Those opposed, I bid you leave.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200360</h1>\n\n<p>Would that it were within my power to welcome you and your people, Lady Yugiri. As you have observed, however, my authority in such matters is regrettably limited.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200370</h1>\n\n<p>Without the consent of the Syndicate, I cannot act.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200380</h1>\n\n<p>I understand, Your Grace. And I appreciate all that you have done on our behalf.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200390</h1>\n\n<p>The nerve of the man... If that bastard had not forsaken the eastern trade route, Little Ala Mhigo would now be thriving.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200400</h1>\n\n<p>That you should have traveled so far, under such dire circumstances, only to be refused in this manner is utterly unconscionable. Pray accept my sincerest apologies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200410</h1>\n\n<p>Now that the Empire no longer poses an immediate threat, they see little reason to maintain the pretense of unity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200420</h1>\n\n<p>The Monetarists have grown especially defiant of late\u2500Lord Lolorito most of all.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200430</h1>\n\n<p>But this is neither the time nor place for that discussion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300010</h1>\n\n<p>How goes the fishing? Caught anything slippery?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300020</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. Our suspicions were well founded. The Serpent Reavers are indeed the culprits.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300030</h1>\n\n<p>The plot thickens...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300040</h1>\n\n<p>Has there been any movement in Thanalan?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300050</h1>\n\n<p>It has been blessedly quiet. Which is to say the Amalj'aa are being no more or less of a nuisance than usual, summoning Ifrit with such crystals as they have hoarded.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300060</h1>\n\n<p>Urianger, too, reports naught out of the ordinary.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300070</h1>\n\n<p>Then we have our explanation.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300080</h1>\n\n<p>Your explanation for what, pray tell?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300090</h1>\n\n<p>For the recent spate of crystal thefts in Thanalan. We naturally assumed that the trail would lead us back to the Amalj'aa.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300100</h1>\n\n<p>Yet it did not. It led us across the sea unto Vylbrand.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300110</h1>\n\n<p>Vylbrand...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300120</h1>\n\n<p>There have been reports of increased Sahagin activity of late...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300130</h1>\n\n<p>Oh gods...they mean to summon Leviathan?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300140</h1>\n\n<p>That is the way of it, I fear.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300150</h1>\n\n<p>Whilst conducting our investigation on behalf of the Mineral Concern, we came upon evidence implicating the Serpent Reavers.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300160</h1>\n\n<p>With the aid of the Maelstrom, I was able to verify our suspicions. 'Tis only a matter of time before Leviathan returns to harrow the seas.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300170</h1>\n\n<p>But there is more. One of the Sahagin\u2500an elder, by my judgment\u2500spoke of attaining the \u201cgift and knowledge of eternity.\u201d</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300180</h1>\n\n<p><moan></p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400010</h1>\n\n<p>Such a disturbance in the aether... If I did not know better, I should think this device defective.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400020</h1>\n\n<p>And there is the explanation...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400030</h1>\n\n<p>Soon! Sssoon it shall begin! Our Lord shall rise 'midst sssurging waves to wash away the finless ones!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400040</h1>\n\n<p>And I shall be granted the gift and knowledge of eternity, and with the emissary ssstand equal! Then shall I know no cesssation, no oblivion!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400050</h1>\n\n<p>...Whence comes this promise of immortality? The emissary?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>We have outstayed our welcome.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500010</h1>\n\n<p>\u201cThe gift...and knowledge.\u201d</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500020</h1>\n\n<p>Are the two of you quite well?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500030</h1>\n\n<p>You...you shared that vision, did you not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500040</h1>\n\n<p>Even before the Sahagin made mention of the emissary, I recognized Elidibus's words. He is behind this.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500050</h1>\n\n<p>But surely it is not within his power to grant the Echo?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500060</h1>\n\n<p>My lady\u2500unless we act swiftly, Leviathan will rise again. The Admiral has already requested that we intervene to prevent this. Failing that, we are to attend to the primal's extermination.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500070</h1>\n\n<p>She will have our full cooperation. Let us make haste to Limsa Lominsa.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500080</h1>\n\n<p>I mean to play a part in this mission. Tataru\u2500pray take charge in my absence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500090</h1>\n\n<p>My lady, are you sure this is wise?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500100</h1>\n\n<p>I am aware of the risks. But there is something I must see with mine own eyes.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500110</h1>\n\n<p>...The true nature of the Echo.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500120</h1>\n\n<p>Very well. I shall not stand in your way...on the condition that you permit me to accompany you as bodyguard.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500130</h1>\n\n<p>Your company is ever welcome, Thancred.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500140</h1>\n\n<p>I take it something ill is afoot?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500150</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. A primal is about to be loosed upon Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500160</h1>\n\n<p>A...primal?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500170</h1>\n\n<p>A godlike being whose very existence is a bane upon the land. We Scions of the Seventh Dawn are sworn to put an end to their kind.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500180</h1>\n\n<p>I see. Know then that I am learned in the arts of war. In return for the kindness you have shown my people, I would lend you my blade.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500190</h1>\n\n<p>It would be most welcome. When contending with a primal, one can never have too many able allies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500200</h1>\n\n<p>If you crave a more intimate understanding of the problems facing Eorzea, this experience is like to provide it. Be sure to come well prepared.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600010</h1>\n\n<p>Damn them... They have made thralls of soldiers and civilians both...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600030</h1>\n\n<p>Did I miss much?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600040</h1>\n\n<p>Hah.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600050</h1>\n\n<p>Yah.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600060</h1>\n\n<p>So that is how you fight in the Far East? Mental note: pick no quarrel with Domans.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600070</h1>\n\n<p>But seriously: if I am to keep up, I must needs forsake elegance for efficiency.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600080</h1>\n\n<p>Yah.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600090</h1>\n\n<p>Hah.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600100</h1>\n\n<p>Hmmm...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600110</h1>\n\n<p>To the aetheryte!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700010</h1>\n\n<p>You'll forgive me my lateness.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700020</h1>\n\n<p>I've been something of a liability of late, I know. 'Tis high time I set about making amends.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700030</h1>\n\n<p>Pshhh! Long have you shriveled shhhorewalkers tormented our kind!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700040</h1>\n\n<p>But no more!

It's the Echo!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700090</h1>\n\n<p>What!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700100</h1>\n\n<p>Pshhh! Sssuch power!

Pshhh...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700210</h1>\n\n<p>Wh-Where did he go!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700220</h1>\n\n<p>What say you? Nary a single ship!? Hells take that sea demon!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700230</h1>\n\n<p>Gather the survivors and get to shore. Leave the wrecks for the pirates.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700240</h1>\n\n<p>Leviathan wastes no time. The diversionary squadron is lost.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700250</h1>\n\n<p>For a mercy, 'twould seem the primal now makes for open sea. But why does he not press his advantage? Unless...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700260</h1>\n\n<p>Gods save us, he means to unleash a tidal wave!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800010</h1>\n\n<p>There used to be a hamlet beyond South Tidegate in western La Noscea. Halfstone, 'twas called.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800020</h1>\n\n<p>Some years prior to the Maelstrom's founding, Leviathan rose from the briny depths, and set about unleashing watery hell upon us. On that occasion, the Company of Heroes put him down before he could do too much damage.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800030</h1>\n\n<p>But when the bastard came next, this time in the wake of the Calamity, we were not so fortunate. Weary of ravaging our shoreline, he summoned a tidal wave which fair leveled Halfstone, and washed the soil away for good measure.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800040</h1>\n\n<p>The area was subsequently occupied by the Sahagin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800050</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, the thrice-damned creatures transformed it into a spawning ground for their brood.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800060</h1>\n\n<p>Given the quantity of crystals stolen to feed him and his legion of thralls, we can be fairly sure that Leviathan is stronger now than in his previous incarnations.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800070</h1>\n\n<p>If that sea demon is left to wreak havoc, what befell Halfstone may well befall a larger settlement\u2500even Limsa.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800080</h1>\n\n<p>That cannot happen. The primal must be stopped.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800090</h1>\n\n<p>That was ever our objective, Admiral. But how are we to achieve it?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800100</h1>\n\n<p>The sea is Leviathan's uncontested domain. The ships of the Third Squadron could not close to within a hundred yalms of the primal, nor could their cannons pierce his defenses.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800110</h1>\n\n<p>I have read the reports, Master Thancred. Our warships may as well have been bloody pleasure barges for all the good they did. Seven hells... Is there no way that we might strike back?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800120</h1>\n\n<p>The Company of Heroes defeated Leviathan having first lured him into an inlet, but we must needs contend with him upon the open sea. It will avail us little to consult past experience.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800130</h1>\n\n<p>Admiral, if I may.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800140</h1>\n\n<p>Speak freely, Marshal.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800150</h1>\n\n<p>By all accounts, Leviathan's most formidable weapon is the very sea itself. Waves and whirlpools, tides and currents\u2500all these things are his to command. The key to victory, I believe, lies in disarming our foe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800160</h1>\n\n<p>This, in effect, is what the Company of Heroes achieved with their ruse. We cannot lure Leviathan from the sea a second time, but what if we could weaken his hold upon the element of water? I have heard of devices capable of such wonders. They draw upon the power of corrupted crystals, I am told.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800170</h1>\n\n<p>If mounted upon a ship, such a device might be used to prevent Leviathan from bringing the full force of the sea to bear against us, rendering him no more dangerous than any other sea serpent.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800180</h1>\n\n<p>Of course... Cid built a similar device to grant the Enterprise safe passage through Garuda's tempest, did he not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800190</h1>\n\n<p>Begging your pardon, my lady, but to give credit where it's due, this is something I heard from an old arcanist friend of mine.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800200</h1>\n\n<p>It makes little difference who thought of it first, so long as it works. Beg the specifications of this device from your friend, and I shall pass them on to our people at Naldiq & Vymelli's.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800210</h1>\n\n<p>But before we proceed any further, I would voice one concern: piercing Garuda's defenses is one thing, suppressing Leviathan's attacks quite another.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800220</h1>\n\n<p>In matters of science, I am as a babbling babe, but I cannot well imagine that such a feat would be possible without a veritable mountain of corrupted crystals.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800230</h1>\n\n<p>The question being: do we have a ship big enough to bear such a burden?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800240</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap not, Admiral. But two might. Recall you the tale of Mistbeard's greatest haul? It is said that he lashed two ships together, side by side, the better to bear his plunder.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800250</h1>\n\n<p>By your leave, we might attempt to repeat the trick. The gods know, it would be quicker than building a new vessel.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800260</h1>\n\n<p>Mistbeard did this? Truly, Marshal, upon the subject of the pirate king, you are as a scholar.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800270</h1>\n\n<p>Now, from what I have gleaned of these matters, the device will need to be in close and constant proximity to the target. To wit, we must lash our twin vessel to Leviathan.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800280</h1>\n\n<p>This in itself will be no small feat. Ramming speed will be required, but given the weight of the cargo, that will only be attainable with the aid of a towing vessel...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800290</h1>\n\n<p>Suffice it to say, the task of piloting said vessel will entail considerable danger, and I would not ask it of another. I volunteer myself.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800300</h1>\n\n<p>'Twill be dangerous for all involved...but we have no better recourse. Very well.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800310</h1>\n\n<p>Commodore. Assemble the remnants of the fleet at Moraby Bay.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800320</h1>\n\n<p>Give priority to our soundest vessels. The repairs can wait.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800330</h1>\n\n<p>Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn, command of the operation is yours. I want that twin vessel ready to sail posthaste.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800340</h1>\n\n<p>At once, Admiral!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800350</h1>\n\n<p>And then there is the small matter of slaying the beast... The fate of Limsa Lominsa rests upon your shoulders once again. Go well, Warrior of Light.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900010</h1>\n\n<p>We Lominsans are sworn to strive \u201cTill sea swallows all\u201d\u2500and swallow all it would have, had Leviathan prevailed. That we still strive now, we owe in no small part to you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900020</h1>\n\n<p>Not for the first time, you have delivered Limsa Lominsa from the wrath of a primal. Never has our nation known a stouter ally.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900030</h1>\n\n<p>On behalf of my people, I give you my humblest thanks.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900040</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis meet that I give thanks to old Mistbeard, too, for his fine solution. Whatever else he may have been, 'tis clear he was a resourceful soul. Would that I had a man like him in my service.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900050</h1>\n\n<p>Before I set foot in these lands, I had no inkling that the people of Eorzea contended with such mighty foes. Suffice it to say, their existence came as something of a shock\u2500as did the idea that they could be defeated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900060</h1>\n\n<p>This experience has served to remind me of the vastness of the world...and the boundless potential of man.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900070</h1>\n\n<p>Though I am but a refugee in this realm, I would fain be of use to you in your fight.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900080</h1>\n\n<p>Know that I am tutored in one of the foremost combat arts of the Far East. It may seem...outlandish to the Eorzean eye, but should any of your people care to learn, I would be pleased to initiate them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900090</h1>\n\n<p>And I will see to it that they are grateful. I have no doubt that your knowledge and skills will serve us well.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900100</h1>\n\n<p>Besides, your art is not so outlandish as you think. Would you not agree, Master Thancred?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900110</h1>\n\n<p>Naught escapes your searching eye, Admiral.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900120</h1>\n\n<p>Few are privy to this information, but Limsa Lominsa is home to a certain...secret fraternity. Its members are trained in a form of combat not unlike your own.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900130</h1>\n\n<p>By my judgment, it should not be beyond such individuals to adapt to the techniques I witnessed you employing with such admirable deftness.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900140</h1>\n\n<p>I am heartened to hear this. I, too, noted a kinship between your style and mine own. Though it seemed to me that you fought differently in the beginning.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900150</h1>\n\n<p>A-Aye, I suppose I did... What can I say? I am a man of many talents. Hahaha...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900160</h1>\n\n<p>Though you may labor to believe it, Thancred was once something of a scoundrel, who fraternized with the criminal class in these parts.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900170</h1>\n\n<p>Y-Y'shtola! You jest, of course!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900180</h1>\n\n<p>But for a chance encounter with Alphinaud's grandsire, he might never have left Limsa Lominsa; or received an education in Sharlayan; or taken up his post in Ul'dah\u2500which is where he trained in the blade, lest you wonder.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900190</h1>\n\n<p>Minfilia\u2500please!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900200</h1>\n\n<p>It would seem there is more to you than meets the eye, Master Thancred.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900210</h1>\n\n<p>Lady Yugiri\u2500I am told that you and yours came to Eorzea seeking permanent resettlement, and that many Domans have since been engaged as frontier hands at Revenant's Toll. Mor Dhona is many things, but a place of refuge it is not.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900220</h1>\n\n<p>Know that I would like nothing better than to furnish your people with a new home here on Lominsan soil. Alas, racked by instability as we are, our nation is in no fit state to take you in.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900230</h1>\n\n<p>Yet I'll not have it said that we turned a blind eye to your suffering. Until such time as we can do more, I pledge to send provisions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900240</h1>\n\n<p>We are in your debt, Admiral. I realize that it scarce qualifies as repayment, but if it please you, I shall set about sharing my martial knowledge with your people at once.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900250</h1>\n\n<p>You wished a word in private.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900260</h1>\n\n<p>The better not to spoil the festive mood.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900270</h1>\n\n<p>History repeats itself, Admiral. As the kobolds did before them, the Sahagin resorted to summoning their god over a territorial feud. They acted in self-preservation.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900280</h1>\n\n<p>It may be that the Sahagin initiated this particular clash, but how it begins does not interest me so much as how it ends.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900290</h1>\n\n<p>I have not forgotten our conversation, Y'shtola. I am aware that man bears part of the blame for the primals' existence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900300</h1>\n\n<p>Nor am I ignorant of the Sahagin's reason for acting. They sought to secure a place to breed and multiply, that their kind might survive. Self-preservation, as you say.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900310</h1>\n\n<p>But we have as much right to live and thrive as they. If our own survival is threatened, are we to lay down our arms and welcome oblivion? Nay.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900320</h1>\n\n<p>And so you kill, that you might live. Yet if living is a right, then that right belongs to all peoples, be they men or beastmen.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900330</h1>\n\n<p>I'll not deny your reasoning. But when a storm gathers, it falls to me to see my people safely through it. That is my duty, and I shall do it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900340</h1>\n\n<p>As must we all, Admiral. Stay the course, then, but know that it will lead to no good end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900350</h1>\n\n<p>Man has ever put himself first and foremost.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900360</h1>\n\n<p>To justify his actions, he clads himself in the armor of righteousness\u2500though it be a fancy of his own making.

    "text_clean": "000020 'Tis I. The situation may be more complicated than we anticipated. 000030 Indeed. I shall remain watchful. 000040 Ere thou goest another matter requireth thine attention. A young maiden, full eager to  000050 Wherefore inquirest thou of her fairness!? Very well. Be she damsel or devil, I shall direct her steps to Revenant's Toll. 000060 ...Save thine insinuations for one given to such impropriety. Thou shalt not find me amenable. 000070 (-???-)Far across the sea, from the land of Doma, have we traveled. We seek audience with the ruler of these lands. Who here speaks for you? 100010 We have traveled some several thousand malms across the sea, from the nation of Doma, in hopes that we might find sanctuary in these lands. 100020 Sanctuary, Lady Yugiri? 100030 Aye. Lying within Othard, Doma was under the dominion of the Garlean Empire, as I am sure you are aware. 100040 When the war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we espied an opportunity to free ourselves from the yoke of imperial oppression, and took up arms. 100050 ...Only to be crushed. And so I gathered what few Domans escaped the reckoning, and guided them hither to your shores. 100060 A war of succession...? Then the Emperor... Forgive me, you said that Doma  was  under imperial rule, did you not? 100070 Doma is gone. Razed to the ground as an example to the other provinces. 100080 Twelve have mercy... And your people? 100090 On a ship anchored in Vesper Bay, flying borrowed colors. 100100 Many were complicit in the rebellion, or are kin to those who were. They will not come ashore until I send word that it is safe to do so. 100110 I sought an audience with your rulers, but was summarily refused. 100120 The lords of Ul'dah are not wont to entertain foreign refugees without suitable encouragement. 100130 Mayhap I was foolish to expect otherwise. But our supplies run low, and we have young ones in urgent need of care. 100140 I have seen the tents outside the gates, however. We are not the first to seek asylum, nor will we be the last. 100150 ...Be that as it may, Ul'dah is no friend to Garlemald. Your tale would stir the hearts of many men and women here. 100160 The sultana and the Syndicate will not be so easily swayed but I shall see that you are granted an opportunity to plead your case. 100170 This is within your power? 100180 Well...far be it from me to boast, but I do have the ear of certain influential individuals. 100190 I am in your debt. 100200 Lady Yugiri, forgive me for observing, but...your choice of attire seems like to evoke feelings of mistrust. 100210 Men are wont to fear the unfamiliar. We know this from experience. 100220 We seek only to spare the people of Ul'dah unnecessary disquiet. 100230 I shall defer to your experience, then. 100240 I thank you for your understanding. 100250 It seems I have urgent business with the Flame General. I leave our guests in your capable hands. 200000 I, Yugiri of Doma, am honored to meet you at last, Your Grace. To mark this auspicious occasion, I should like to present to you the finest treasures our humble nation has to offer... 200010 Alas, the circumstances which have brought me here today have divested me of both time and dignity. I come before you as a pauper in direst need of aid to request that you grant my people asylum. 200020 I, Nanamo, seventeenth in the line of Ul, welcome you to our city. Be at ease, Lady Yugiri. 200030 Although I myself have heard the tale of your misfortune, I would ask that you recount it once more for the benefit of the others here present. 200040 As you wish, Your Grace. For many years, my nation, Doma, suffered under the yoke of imperial rule, and my people yearned to be free. Thus, when a war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we sought to take advantage of the chaos and reclaim our liberty. 200050 Alas, our enemy proved less preoccupied than we had hoped, and our rebellion was put down in the most brutal fashion. 200060 Those who survived how many do they number? 200070 More than two hundred souls huddle within the cramped confines of our own galleon's hold. Yet this figure accounts for but one of a number of ships which escaped the purge. 200080 It is my hope that you will allow us all to dwell within your walls. Should that prove unfeasible, however, I humbly ask that you accept as many of my people as your resources allow. 200090 Pray understand, we do not beg a boon, but propose instead an arrangement. We would serve as soldiers or tradesmen until our debt is repaid. 200100 What are the Syndicate's opinions on this matter? 200110 I, for one, think it's a marvelous idea. Lady Yugiri and her people strike me as an industrious lot, and there are parts of the city which have yet to be fully restored. If they are willing to work, I see no reason not to let them. 200120 The head of the Mirage Trust is not known for his generosity. He sees profit in this. 200130 I agree. That said, these are foreign refugees. To admit them would require a formal resolution. Shall we call a vote? 200140 The law is the law. 200150 Lord Lolorito? 200160 Tell me: are you blind or willfully ignorant? Even now, our streets are choked with the displaced victims of the Calamity and Ala Mhigan refugees. 200170 They live hand-to-mouth, subsisting on aid provided by the Immortal Flames the cost of which grows ever higher! 200180 The wealth of Ul'dah is not without limits, my friends. 200190 And need I remind you that these refugees are prone to violence and criminal activity? You have all read the reports, I think? 200200 Without homes or employment, it is only a matter of time before men grow desperate and take that which they imagine has been unjustly denied them. Yet, knowing this, you would have us swell their ranks. Mayhap you think the Brass Blades and the Flames are not hard-pressed enough? 200210 Some say the chairman of the East Aldenard Trading Company passes gil thrice daily. This may explain how he came to be the wealthiest man in Ul'dah. Or it may simply be that he's ruthless beyond reckoning. 200220 Surely the sultanate can support the few hundred Domans Lady Yugiri represents? That our resources have been taxed I do not deny, but we are hardly in danger of financial collapse. 200230 I move that an exception be made. 200240 An exception, Your Grace? I am suddenly reminded of a similar debate some years ago, regarding a number of Ala Mhigan refugees, if memory serves. 200250 What were your words that day? Ah, yes:  The law is the law.  And so our visitors remained in Little Ala Mhigo. 200260 Mayhap our wise and benevolent sultana would be so good as to enlighten us as to which other of our laws should not be upheld? 200270 Mind your tongue, Lolorito. 200280 My lord, I share your concern for the welfare of our great nation, but we must endeavor to take a longer view. You know as well as I that people can be a resource still more precious than gil. 200290 Precious or not, they were never yet so reliable. And unlike those who frequent your establishment, I have no desire to gamble with my future. 200300 Ul'dah's greatest asset is, and has ever been, her material wealth. We risk this at our peril. 200310 One need only look to Teledji Adeledji's example for evidence of the danger in allowing sentiment to dictate policy. 200320 How far the vaunted Mirage hath fallen, both in repute and profitability, since he began employing refugees... 200330 How I choose to conduct my affairs is not your concern, my lord! 200340 A proposal has been tabled. Given its urgency, I move we forgo further debate and call a vote. 200350 To accept the Doman refugees or not. Those in favor, I bid you remain. Those opposed, I bid you leave. 200360 Would that it were within my power to welcome you and your people, Lady Yugiri. As you have observed, however, my authority in such matters is regrettably limited. 200370 Without the consent of the Syndicate, I cannot act. 200380 I understand, Your Grace. And I appreciate all that you have done on our behalf. 200390 The nerve of the man... If that bastard had not forsaken the eastern trade route, Little Ala Mhigo would now be thriving. 200400 That you should have traveled so far, under such dire circumstances, only to be refused in this manner is utterly unconscionable. Pray accept my sincerest apologies. 200410 Now that the Empire no longer poses an immediate threat, they see little reason to maintain the pretense of unity. 200420 The Monetarists have grown especially defiant of late Lord Lolorito most of all. 200430 But this is neither the time nor place for that discussion. 300010 How goes the fishing? Caught anything slippery? 300020 Aye. Our suspicions were well founded. The Serpent Reavers are indeed the culprits. 300030 The plot thickens... 300040 Has there been any movement in Thanalan? 300050 It has been blessedly quiet. Which is to say the Amalj'aa are being no more or less of a nuisance than usual, summoning Ifrit with such crystals as they have hoarded. 300060 Urianger, too, reports naught out of the ordinary. 300070 Then we have our explanation. 300080 Your explanation for what, pray tell? 300090 For the recent spate of crystal thefts in Thanalan. We naturally assumed that the trail would lead us back to the Amalj'aa. 300100 Yet it did not. It led us across the sea unto Vylbrand. 300110 Vylbrand...? 300120 There have been reports of increased Sahagin activity of late... 300130 Oh gods...they mean to summon Leviathan? 300140 That is the way of it, I fear. 300150 Whilst conducting our investigation on behalf of the Mineral Concern, we came upon evidence implicating the Serpent Reavers. 300160 With the aid of the Maelstrom, I was able to verify our suspicions. 'Tis only a matter of time before Leviathan returns to harrow the seas. 300170 But there is more. One of the Sahagin an elder, by my judgment spoke of attaining the  gift and knowledge of eternity.  300180 <moan> 400010 Such a disturbance in the aether... If I did not know better, I should think this device defective. 400020 And there is the explanation... 400030 Soon! Sssoon it shall begin! Our Lord shall rise 'midst sssurging waves to wash away the finless ones! 400040 And I shall be granted the gift and knowledge of eternity, and with the emissary ssstand equal! Then shall I know no cesssation, no oblivion! 400050 ...Whence comes this promise of immortality? The emissary? 400060 We have outstayed our welcome. 500010  The gift...and knowledge.  500020 Are the two of you quite well? 500030 You...you shared that vision, did you not? 500040 Even before the Sahagin made mention of the emissary, I recognized Elidibus's words. He is behind this. 500050 But surely it is not within his power to grant the Echo? 500060 My lady unless we act swiftly, Leviathan will rise again. The Admiral has already requested that we intervene to prevent this. Failing that, we are to attend to the primal's extermination. 500070 She will have our full cooperation. Let us make haste to Limsa Lominsa. 500080 I mean to play a part in this mission. Tataru pray take charge in my absence. 500090 My lady, are you sure this is wise? 500100 I am aware of the risks. But there is something I must see with mine own eyes. 500110 ...The true nature of the Echo. 500120 Very well. I shall not stand in your way...on the condition that you permit me to accompany you as bodyguard. 500130 Your company is ever welcome, Thancred. 500140 I take it something ill is afoot? 500150 Aye. A primal is about to be loosed upon Eorzea. 500160 A...primal? 500170 A godlike being whose very existence is a bane upon the land. We Scions of the Seventh Dawn are sworn to put an end to their kind. 500180 I see. Know then that I am learned in the arts of war. In return for the kindness you have shown my people, I would lend you my blade. 500190 It would be most welcome. When contending with a primal, one can never have too many able allies. 500200 If you crave a more intimate understanding of the problems facing Eorzea, this experience is like to provide it. Be sure to come well prepared. 600010 Damn them... They have made thralls of soldiers and civilians both... 600030 Did I miss much? 600040 Hah. 600050 Yah. 600060 So that is how you fight in the Far East? Mental note: pick no quarrel with Domans. 600070 But seriously: if I am to keep up, I must needs forsake elegance for efficiency. 600080 Yah. 600090 Hah. 600100 Hmmm... 600110 To the aetheryte! 700010 You'll forgive me my lateness. 700020 I've been something of a liability of late, I know. 'Tis high time I set about making amends. 700030 Pshhh! Long have you shriveled shhhorewalkers tormented our kind! 700040 But no more! Your time is at an end! 700050 You shall perish with sssalt in your wounds and sssea in your lungs! 700060 Lord of the Whorl, hearken to our plea! Lord of the Whorl, deliver us from our misery! 700070 Do you feel that!? 700080 I know this sensation... It's the Echo! 700090 What!? 700100 Pshhh! Sssuch power! It is...transcendent! 700110 Seven hells... 700120 Pshhhahahahahaaa! Ssstrike me down if you will! It is futile! I have massstered the gift! I am...eternal! 700130 O mighty Leviathan, ruler of the ssseas, born of waters primordial! I offer unto You this frail fleshhh, that You might grant Your faithful servants deliverance! 700140 I beseech You! Come forth! 700150 Die, damn you! 700160 Foolishhh shorewalker! You cannot kill that which is eternal! 700170 Heavens forfend... 700180 Damn it all! 700190 Pshhh!? My being...ebbs away... B-But it should by rightsss be infinite! 700200 Am I not...immortal? Curse you, Emissary! You promised me...everlasssting... Pshhh... 700210 Wh-Where did he go!? 700220 What say you? Nary a single ship!? Hells take that sea demon! 700230 Gather the survivors and get to shore. Leave the wrecks for the pirates. 700240 Leviathan wastes no time. The diversionary squadron is lost. 700250 For a mercy, 'twould seem the primal now makes for open sea. But why does he not press his advantage? Unless... 700260 Gods save us, he means to unleash a tidal wave! 800010 There used to be a hamlet beyond South Tidegate in western La Noscea. Halfstone, 'twas called. 800020 Some years prior to the Maelstrom's founding, Leviathan rose from the briny depths, and set about unleashing watery hell upon us. On that occasion, the Company of Heroes put him down before he could do too much damage. 800030 But when the bastard came next, this time in the wake of the Calamity, we were not so fortunate. Weary of ravaging our shoreline, he summoned a tidal wave which fair leveled Halfstone, and washed the soil away for good measure. 800040 The area was subsequently occupied by the Sahagin. 800050 Aye, the thrice-damned creatures transformed it into a spawning ground for their brood. 800060 Given the quantity of crystals stolen to feed him and his legion of thralls, we can be fairly sure that Leviathan is stronger now than in his previous incarnations. 800070 If that sea demon is left to wreak havoc, what befell Halfstone may well befall a larger settlement even Limsa. 800080 That cannot happen. The primal must be stopped. 800090 That was ever our objective, Admiral. But how are we to achieve it? 800100 The sea is Leviathan's uncontested domain. The ships of the Third Squadron could not close to within a hundred yalms of the primal, nor could their cannons pierce his defenses. 800110 I have read the reports, Master Thancred. Our warships may as well have been bloody pleasure barges for all the good they did. Seven hells... Is there no way that we might strike back? 800120 The Company of Heroes defeated Leviathan having first lured him into an inlet, but we must needs contend with him upon the open sea. It will avail us little to consult past experience. 800130 Admiral, if I may. 800140 Speak freely, Marshal. 800150 By all accounts, Leviathan's most formidable weapon is the very sea itself. Waves and whirlpools, tides and currents all these things are his to command. The key to victory, I believe, lies in disarming our foe. 800160 This, in effect, is what the Company of Heroes achieved with their ruse. We cannot lure Leviathan from the sea a second time, but what if we could weaken his hold upon the element of water? I have heard of devices capable of such wonders. They draw upon the power of corrupted crystals, I am told. 800170 If mounted upon a ship, such a device might be used to prevent Leviathan from bringing the full force of the sea to bear against us, rendering him no more dangerous than any other sea serpent. 800180 Of course... Cid built a similar device to grant the Enterprise safe passage through Garuda's tempest, did he not? 800190 Begging your pardon, my lady, but to give credit where it's due, this is something I heard from an old arcanist friend of mine. 800200 It makes little difference who thought of it first, so long as it works. Beg the specifications of this device from your friend, and I shall pass them on to our people at Naldiq & Vymelli's. 800210 But before we proceed any further, I would voice one concern: piercing Garuda's defenses is one thing, suppressing Leviathan's attacks quite another. 800220 In matters of science, I am as a babbling babe, but I cannot well imagine that such a feat would be possible without a veritable mountain of corrupted crystals. 800230 The question being: do we have a ship big enough to bear such a burden? 800240 Mayhap not, Admiral. But two might. Recall you the tale of Mistbeard's greatest haul? It is said that he lashed two ships together, side by side, the better to bear his plunder. 800250 By your leave, we might attempt to repeat the trick. The gods know, it would be quicker than building a new vessel. 800260 Mistbeard did this? Truly, Marshal, upon the subject of the pirate king, you are as a scholar. 800270 Now, from what I have gleaned of these matters, the device will need to be in close and constant proximity to the target. To wit, we must lash our twin vessel to Leviathan. 800280 This in itself will be no small feat. Ramming speed will be required, but given the weight of the cargo, that will only be attainable with the aid of a towing vessel... 800290 Suffice it to say, the task of piloting said vessel will entail considerable danger, and I would not ask it of another. I volunteer myself. 800300 'Twill be dangerous for all involved...but we have no better recourse. Very well. 800310 Commodore. Assemble the remnants of the fleet at Moraby Bay. 800320 Give priority to our soundest vessels. The repairs can wait. 800330 Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn, command of the operation is yours. I want that twin vessel ready to sail posthaste. 800340 At once, Admiral! 800350 And then there is the small matter of slaying the beast... The fate of Limsa Lominsa rests upon your shoulders once again. Go well, Warrior of Light. 900010 We Lominsans are sworn to strive  Till sea swallows all and swallow all it would have, had Leviathan prevailed. That we still strive now, we owe in no small part to you. 900020 Not for the first time, you have delivered Limsa Lominsa from the wrath of a primal. Never has our nation known a stouter ally. 900030 On behalf of my people, I give you my humblest thanks. 900040 'Tis meet that I give thanks to old Mistbeard, too, for his fine solution. Whatever else he may have been, 'tis clear he was a resourceful soul. Would that I had a man like him in my service. 900050 Before I set foot in these lands, I had no inkling that the people of Eorzea contended with such mighty foes. Suffice it to say, their existence came as something of a shock as did the idea that they could be defeated. 900060 This experience has served to remind me of the vastness of the world...and the boundless potential of man. 900070 Though I am but a refugee in this realm, I would fain be of use to you in your fight. 900080 Know that I am tutored in one of the foremost combat arts of the Far East. It may seem...outlandish to the Eorzean eye, but should any of your people care to learn, I would be pleased to initiate them. 900090 And I will see to it that they are grateful. I have no doubt that your knowledge and skills will serve us well. 900100 Besides, your art is not so outlandish as you think. Would you not agree, Master Thancred? 900110 Naught escapes your searching eye, Admiral. 900120 Few are privy to this information, but Limsa Lominsa is home to a certain...secret fraternity. Its members are trained in a form of combat not unlike your own. 900130 By my judgment, it should not be beyond such individuals to adapt to the techniques I witnessed you employing with such admirable deftness. 900140 I am heartened to hear this. I, too, noted a kinship between your style and mine own. Though it seemed to me that you fought differently in the beginning. 900150 A-Aye, I suppose I did... What can I say? I am a man of many talents. Hahaha... 900160 Though you may labor to believe it, Thancred was once something of a scoundrel, who fraternized with the criminal class in these parts. 900170 Y-Y'shtola! You jest, of course! 900180 But for a chance encounter with Alphinaud's grandsire, he might never have left Limsa Lominsa; or received an education in Sharlayan; or taken up his post in Ul'dah which is where he trained in the blade, lest you wonder. 900190 Minfilia please! 900200 It would seem there is more to you than meets the eye, Master Thancred. 900210 Lady Yugiri I am told that you and yours came to Eorzea seeking permanent resettlement, and that many Domans have since been engaged as frontier hands at Revenant's Toll. Mor Dhona is many things, but a place of refuge it is not. 900220 Know that I would like nothing better than to furnish your people with a new home here on Lominsan soil. Alas, racked by instability as we are, our nation is in no fit state to take you in. 900230 Yet I'll not have it said that we turned a blind eye to your suffering. Until such time as we can do more, I pledge to send provisions. 900240 We are in your debt, Admiral. I realize that it scarce qualifies as repayment, but if it please you, I shall set about sharing my martial knowledge with your people at once. 900250 You wished a word in private. 900260 The better not to spoil the festive mood. 900270 History repeats itself, Admiral. As the kobolds did before them, the Sahagin resorted to summoning their god over a territorial feud. They acted in self-preservation. 900280 It may be that the Sahagin initiated this particular clash, but how it begins does not interest me so much as how it ends. 900290 I have not forgotten our conversation, Y'shtola. I am aware that man bears part of the blame for the primals' existence. 900300 Nor am I ignorant of the Sahagin's reason for acting. They sought to secure a place to breed and multiply, that their kind might survive. Self-preservation, as you say. 900310 But we have as much right to live and thrive as they. If our own survival is threatened, are we to lay down our arms and welcome oblivion? Nay. 900320 And so you kill, that you might live. Yet if living is a right, then that right belongs to all peoples, be they men or beastmen. 900330 I'll not deny your reasoning. But when a storm gathers, it falls to me to see my people safely through it. That is my duty, and I shall do it. 900340 As must we all, Admiral. Stay the course, then, but know that it will lead to no good end. 900350 Man has ever put himself first and foremost. 900360 To justify his actions, he clads himself in the armor of righteousness though it be a fancy of his own making. In this, mayhap the Garleans and we Domans are not so different... 900370 Eorzea has become as a raging sea. If we are to keep our heads above the waves, we cannot scruple to drown the man next to us. 900380 When hopes of coexistence founder, strength must determine who has the greater right to live. A00010 I have been reflecting upon the events which took place during our visit to Vylbrand. A00020 If you have a moment, I would share my conclusions with you. Please bear with me. A00030 When the Sahagin elder summoned Leviathan, he employed the power we have come to know as the Echo. A00040 Though I cannot well explain the how of it, it would seem he became immortal in so doing. A00050 When the Admiral subsequently slew him, his spirit emerged from his lifeless flesh, a consciousness shorn of physical form. A00060 Thus transfigured, he took up residence in the body of his minion with the ease of a man donning a favorite glove. A00070 Long have I known that the Echo allows one to pass through the walls of a man's soul. A00080 But never did I imagine that it could free us from our own flesh, nor less that our souls could then occupy the next corporeal vessel to take our fancy. A00090 It was of this that Elidibus spoke an existence which knows neither cessation nor oblivion. A00100 And yet, though the Sahagin had mastered his gift and thereby become immortal, he was by no means invulnerable. A00110 As we both bore witness, he was ultimately absorbed into Leviathan. A00120 And the import of this observation? If the Ascians' mode of existence is indeed the same, it can be inferred that they, too, are not invulnerable that they can be destroyed. A00130 There exists a legend which tells of souls who are reborn upon the cusp of each Umbral Calamity, that they might stay the encroaching Darkness. A00140 To most, it is but a faerie tale, yet recent events have given me cause to wonder: could the legend in fact refer to the Echo? A00150 Much and more yet remains unknown, but I am confident that all will become clear in time. A00160 For the present, however, what matters is that the key to defeating the Ascians may at last be within sight. A00170 With Urianger's aid, it is my hope that I shall fathom this matter ere long. A00180 Ah! I was just about to send for you, my friend. ...Is aught amiss? A00190 Grave tidings from the Sharlayan motherland, my lady. A00200 It doth concern our distant allies, the Students of Baldesion. A00210 What of them? A00220 My lady...the Isle of Val, which for many years hath been the order's home, is no more. A00230 No more? Whatever do you mean? A00240 I relate only that which hath been conveyed unto me by our agents. An aetheric wave of the highest magnitude was recorded in the region. Soon thereafter, 'twas observed that the isle had ceased to be. A00250 'Tis postulated that a magick was evoked, like in power to Ultima. A00260 Twelve preserve... B00010 If there are no other matters, I move that today's meeting be adjourned. B00020 It is done, my lord. B00030 I... <cough> F-Forgive my impertinence, my lord, but these orders... I am uncertain as to what end they serve. B00040 Revolution. C00010 Um. Well, then! C00020 That's enough of a beating for now!",

Tensions long simmering are at last threatening to boil over.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000040</h1>\n\n<p>Ul'dah is a nation infamous for the great disparity between the wealthy and the poor. The majority of the populace accepts this state of affairs because they believe that every man bears responsibility for his own lot in life.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000050</h1>\n\n<p>To an Ul'dahn, money is the foremost\u2500and some would say the only\u2500measure of a man's worth. Small wonder that the wealthiest wield the greatest influence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000060</h1>\n\n<p>So where do the refugees fit into this social hierarchy? What place is there for those who fled Ala Mhigo and the destruction of the Calamity?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000070</h1>\n\n<p>Plainly, there is none. They have no wealth, no power, and no worth. To the Ul'dahn way of thinking, they may as well not exist.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000080</h1>\n\n<p>Choosing to ignore their existence, however, is patently not an option. General Raubahn and the sultana understand this, which is why they ordered the Immortal Flames to provide the refugees aid and succor.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000090</h1>\n\n<p>Yet none would dispute that the expenses incurred by this policy grow by the day, with no end in sight.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000100</h1>\n\n<p>This has prompted more and more Ul'dahns to question their obligation to aid these worthless wanderers... </p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000110</h1>\n\n<p>While more and more refugees have come to resent their treatment at the hands of the sneering citizenry.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000120</h1>\n\n<p>The manner of Lord Lolorito's refusal to grant the Domans asylum bespoke a disdain for all refugees\u2500an attitude shared by the rest of the Monetarists. And you may be sure they make no effort to conceal their opinions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000130</h1>\n\n<p>It was only a matter of time before the refugees united in protest. Nor is it any surprise that some among them would ultimately resort to violence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000140</h1>\n\n<p>That the Immortal Flames should choose this of all occasions to engage in joint training exercises with the other Grand Companies... By the time they return, the situation may well have deteriorated beyond mending.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100010</h1>\n\n<p>Commander Swift has kept us apprised of your recent activities. You've made great strides towards quelling the violence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100020</h1>\n\n<p>Despite our best efforts to determine what provoked this uprising, the truth continues to elude us. Have you uncovered aught which might shed some light on the mystery?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100030</h1>\n\n<p>This information does not leave this room.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100040</h1>\n\n<p>The Syndicate's decision to reject the Doman refugees' appeal for asylum had lasting repercussions. A number of those displaced by the Calamity claimed it was proof of a policy of discrimination.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100050</h1>\n\n<p>Together with a group of Ala Mhigan refugees, they organized a series of demonstrations to protest against the sultanate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100060</h1>\n\n<p>Demonstrations which became heated, but did not descend into violence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100070</h1>\n\n<p> Until a certain incident served as a call to arms.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100080</h1>\n\n<p>A unit of Brass Blades sent to supervise a demonstration loosed arrows upon unarmed protesters.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100090</h1>\n\n<p>It was this atrocity which prompted the refugees to take up arms. I need not tell you what followed.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100100</h1>\n\n<p>We assumed at first that the attack was born of a miscommunication. When emotions run high, they happen. But suspicions were raised regarding the unit's commanding officer, whom I ordered interrogated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100110</h1>\n\n<p>Sure enough, our fears were soon confirmed. The dog confessed that a merchant had offered him coin to give the order\u2500a merchant in the employ of Teledji Adeledji.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100120</h1>\n\n<p>Teledji Adeledji?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100130</h1>\n\n<p>But he spoke in favor of the Domans' cause, and has ever seemed sympathetic towards the refugees' plight. Why would he do such a thing?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100140</h1>\n\n<p>Know you of the Carteneau Reclamation Bill?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100150</h1>\n\n<p>It is a proposal to annex the Carteneau Flats so that refugees may establish permanent settlements.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100160</h1>\n\n<p>When last I looked, that was disputed territory.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100170</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. Some might even call it a battlefield.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200010</h1>\n\n<p>The destruction wrought by Bahamut was greatest at the Carteneau Flats. That much is common knowledge.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200020</h1>\n\n<p>What is less well known is that his rampage laid bare ancient Allagan ruins, of which no record existed.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200030</h1>\n\n<p>There are certain...differences of opinion as to how these ruins should be handled, which is why each nation maintains a military presence in the region to this day.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200040</h1>\n\n<p>Yet differ though we may, we are still allies. Therefore, in the interest of preserving the Eorzean Alliance, we have reached an agreement.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200050</h1>\n\n<p>Any conflict which may arise during the course of military exercises in the region shall have no bearing on relations between our nations.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200060</h1>\n\n<p>In full knowledge of this delicate state of affairs, Teledji Adeledji proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200070</h1>\n\n<p>A shameless bloody ruse which stands to benefit him in but one conceivable way.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200080</h1>\n\n<p>If successful, he will gain control over the disputed territory, under the guise of assisting in the resettlement effort. And you can be sure he'll build an orphanage next to every Allagan ruin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200090</h1>\n\n<p>The man would threaten the unity of the Eorzean Alliance and risk countless lives for personal gain!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200100</h1>\n\n<p>He walks a path all his own, independent of any faction, and beholden to none of his fellows on the Syndicate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200110</h1>\n\n<p>By inciting the less fortunate to violence, he hopes to convince others that the Carteneau Reclamation Bill is the only viable solution.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200120</h1>\n\n<p>His sympathy for the plight of the Domans was naught but posturing to gain credibility with the refugees. Of that there can be no doubt.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300010</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive me, but what could possibly motivate Teledji Adeledji to go to such lengths? What is so special about these ruins that he would risk his position on the Syndicate, and, most likely, charges of treason against the sultanate?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300020</h1>\n\n<p>Omega...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300030</h1>\n\n<p>Pardon?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300040</h1>\n\n<p>An Allagan monstrosity, not unlike the Ultima Weapon. Mayhap larger. We know not. It has yet to be fully excavated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300050</h1>\n\n<p>Allagan inscriptions indicate that it was created to fell Bahamut himself.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300060</h1>\n\n<p>If accurate, it might explain why Nael van Darnus chose to bring the red moon down upon the Carteneau Flats.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300070</h1>\n\n<p>Given the ends he went to to ensure Eorzea's annihilation, destroying the one weapon which could stay the elder primal may well have seemed like good sense.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300080</h1>\n\n<p>When first I bore witness to the power of the Ultima Weapon, I doubted the evidence of my senses... And now you tell me there is another such weapon\u2500one which could contend with Bahamut. Bahamut.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300090</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. We were skeptical ourselves. Truth be told, until the Ultima Weapon's existence came to light, we thought the inscription had been mistranslated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300100</h1>\n\n<p>At present, Omega is more akin to a fossil than a tool of war, having long since ceased to function. As such, its true potential cannot accurately be gauged.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300110</h1>\n\n<p>However, if someone were to restore it, as the Garleans did the Ultima Weapon, I have little doubt that he would wield untold power.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300120</h1>\n\n<p>Power enough to subjugate Ul'dah, like as not, and the rest of Eorzea besides\u2500which is doubtless why Teledji Adeledji yearns to have it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300130</h1>\n\n<p>That he should aspire to world domination... He who has ever walked two paces behind Lord Lolorito in matters of commerce.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300140</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis in acknowledgement of his own limitations that he seeks this power. Woe betide us all should we allow him to have it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300150</h1>\n\n<p>Pray waste no time chasing rats. Only a fool would believe that secrets can be kept in Ul'dah.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300160</h1>\n\n<p>It would seem the implications of the sultanate's refugee problem are rather more far-reaching than we assumed...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400010</h1>\n\n<p>The incident with the new frontier hands? No, no, you need not elaborate\u2500I have been following their progress with no small amount of interest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400020</h1>\n\n<p>Brave men and women all... They do our nation a great service. The existence of a fortified outpost in Mor Dhona will do much to dissuade the Empire from trespassing on Coerthan soil.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400030</h1>\n\n<p>Right glad am I that you have chosen to lend your support to this endeavor. Never let it be said that House Fortemps does not acknowledge the efforts of her allies...or her debts.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400040</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas in the spirit of gratitude that I arranged for sundry supplies to be delivered to Revenant's Toll. That the shipment should chance to be waylaid by heretics is poor fortune, indeed.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400050</h1>\n\n<p>Poor fortune, I say...yet not without precedent. If you would know the truth of it, these incorrigible villains grow more organized with each passing day.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>This new unity of purpose we attribute to their leader\u2500the Lady \u201cIceheart.\u201d But though I have devoted significant resources to the task of identifying this woman, we have yet to learn so much as her birth name.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400070</h1>\n\n<p>What we do know is that the heretics speak of Iceheart in reverent tones, and would gladly embrace death rather than betray her. Such loyalty is rare indeed, and I fear to imagine what so committed a collective might achieve.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400080</h1>\n\n<p>The brigands have not yet been so brazen as to risk direct confrontation here in Dragonhead. Some few of their number have, however, been sighted not far to the west of here...and with ever-increasing regularity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400090</h1>\n\n<p>A visit to Whitebrim Front may bring you the answers you seek. Will you brave the snows knowing what implacable foes may lie in wait?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400100</h1>\n\n<p>Halone's blessings be upon you! Though I take no pride in the admission, many of mine own countrymen are not so well suited as you adventurers to dealing with such foes. Were they dragons, it might be otherwise!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400110</h1>\n\n<p>But truly, I could not wish for a finer ally. You have done much for my house in the past, and I have no doubt but that I shall have cause to celebrate your deeds again ere long.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400120</h1>\n\n<p>Should you learn aught of value, pray return to me forthwith. A warm hearth and a warmer welcome shall be waiting for you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500010</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Hmph...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600010</h1>\n\n<p>Your return is most timely. Of their own accord, my thoughts had turned to your task and the progress thereof. I confess, my imaginings tended toward the grim and bloody.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600020</h1>\n\n<p>But you are here now, and I suspect such frivolous wonderings do little justice to the reality of your travails. Tell me, what did you learn of Iceheart?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600030</h1>\n\n<p>...Indeed. And this transpired at Snowcloak?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600040</h1>\n\n<p>Of all the highlands, that towering wall has borne the worst of the region's brutal shift in climate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600050</h1>\n\n<p>So inhospitable has Snowcloak become that we have still to survey the area in its entirety. Could its frozen heights conceal the heretics' hideaway? Mayhap a more robust reconnaissance effort is in order.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600060</h1>\n\n<p>Putting such considerations aside for the moment, we still know far too little of this Iceheart. That she is capable of commanding such a band of fanatics bespeaks natural authority, and no small measure of charisma.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600070</h1>\n\n<p>As much as I would like to fathom this mystery with you, the situation has grown beyond my personal purview. I am bound by duty to inform the Temple Knights and request that they bring this matter to its conclusion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600080</h1>\n\n<p>Given the glowing reports their new commander has garnered thus far, I am certain that they can be relied upon to take appropriate action.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600090</h1>\n\n<p>Though Iceheart's true identity yet eludes us, you have provided us with a point from which to begin. Sometimes it takes but a single stone to prompt an avalanche.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600100</h1>\n\n<p>On the matter of the stolen provisions, I have already made arrangements for a second shipment to be sent to Revenant's Toll. I could not well allow such an honorable venture to be undermined by one miserable setback!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700010</h1>\n\n<p>Scions of the Seventh Dawn, on behalf of the people of Gridania, I bid you welcome. Your presence is of great comfort to us all in these days of uncertainty.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700020</h1>\n\n<p>I summoned you here to share tidings of a most urgent nature. But a short while ago, the great elemental spoke, and his voice was clarion in its intensity: Ramuh is returned unto the forest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700030</h1>\n\n<p>Scarce had his words ceased to echo in mine ears when we were visited by an emissary from Little Solace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700050</h1>\n\n<p>Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700055</h1>\n\n<p>Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700060</h1>\n\n<p>Though his exact whereabouts remain unknown, we may safely assume that the primal was summoned within the heart of the Sylphlands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700070</h1>\n\n<p>Unlike the other primals you have encountered, Lord Ramuh is no raging avatar of destruction. He is revered as much for his wisdom as his strength, serving as both arbiter and guardian to his children. Given that we and the sylphs found a way to share the Twelveswood, it is my hope that this sagely immortal will be amenable to reason, and that conflict may be avoided.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700080</h1>\n\n<p>Blessed as you are with the power of the Echo, you are one of the few among us who may commune with a primal without fear of influence. I would ask therefore that you represent us in this most delicate of negotiations.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700090</h1>\n\n<p>The Twelveswood has suffered enough. Upon this, we and the sylphs\u2500and I would venture Lord Ramuh himself\u2500are in perfect accord. Let us not endanger our shared home by engaging in unnecessary hostilities.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700100</h1>\n\n<p>Dear friend, I beseech you: safeguard the peace which exists between our peoples.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700110</h1>\n\n<p>You have my thanks.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700120</h1>\n\n<p>Pray make for Little Solace, then. A member of the Order of the Twin Adder awaits you there. He will advise you on how to find the Lord of Levin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700130</h1>\n\n<p>An ill wind blows through the forest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700140</h1>\n\n<p>Yet...it is not only the Twelveswood that flinches at its coming\u2500all the lands of Eorzea shiver in dread anticipation. Have care.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800010</h1>\n\n<p>Thine aura betrays thee, servant of Hydaelyn.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800020</h1>\n\n<p>Thou art the Bringer of Light...bane of Ifrit, Titan, Garuda, and Leviathan.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800030</h1>\n\n<p>I am Ramuh, guardian of the children of the forest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800040</h1>\n\n<p>Thou tramplest upon sacred soil, Bringer of Light. By what right doth man intrude in this sanctuary of the sylphs?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800050</h1>\n\n<p>The Gridanians proffer peace? Their words are born of delusion\u2500thine offer, an insult.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800060</h1>\n\n<p>Thou speakest of harmony, yet carest naught for my children's desires. They did but wish to dwell beneath these boughs in solitude\u2500yet even that was too much to ask of man.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800070</h1>\n\n<p>Thus did they turn to me for succor. The sentence I pronounce upon thy kind is just.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800080</h1>\n\n<p>Gridanian or Garlean, it matters not. The good intent of one excuseth not the misdeeds of the other.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800090</h1>\n\n<p>Thy conflicts have brought naught but anguish and misery unto the forest. All blame doth lie with the darkness that resideth in the breast of man.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800100</h1>\n\n<p>Whence sprung this calamitous seed? In the beginning, no such duality existed. Were light and dark given form when man was born?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800110</h1>\n\n<p>It would explain much. Not least why strife and sorrow follow ever in thy wake. Thou canst not deny the urgings of thine own nature.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800120</h1>\n\n<p>Knowing that thy mere presence here portendeth tragedy, wilt thou persist in this pretense of peacemaking?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800130</h1>\n\n<p>Thou bearest the crystal which I bestowed upon my wayward charges. That they should entrust so precious a gift to thee...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800140</h1>\n\n<p>Thou standest apart from thy kin. Thou art the Bringer of Light, aye...but there is something more in thee...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800150</h1>\n\n<p>Very well, I shall consider thy proposal...shouldst thou survive my trial.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800160</h1>\n\n<p>If thou wouldst champion the cause of harmony, I must have proof that thou art fit to play the role. Weather mine ire, and prove to me thereby that thou hast strength enough to stay the Darkness which threateneth to consume thee.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800170</h1>\n\n<p>Yet if thou shouldst be found wanting, know that all men shall perish in the storm of my judgment!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800180</h1>\n\n<p>Come to me, Bringer of Light. I shall await thee on the field of battle!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800190</h1>\n\n<p>Urianger. It is rare indeed to find you so far from a tome.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800200</h1>\n\n<p>The Lord of Levin himself... Never till this day had I looked upon his visage save in painted renderings, made faint by time... Ever shall this scene remain etched in my mind's eye... Ahem. Beg pardon, my lady.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800210</h1>\n\n<p>I must beg thine aid on a point of research. If thou art resolved to face Lord Ramuh, I would ask thy leave to observe the event...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900010</h1>\n\n<p>I have taken thy measure, Bringer of Light.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900020</h1>\n\n<p>And I judge thee a worthy champion. The task of excising the sin that hath taken root in man's heart is thine.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900030</h1>\n\n<p>Shrink not from employing thy strength in service to the forest, and the wider realm beyond. Like hungering shadows do the enemies of harmony gather, and meekness will but feed them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900040</h1>\n\n<p>If man is to be delivered from the Dark, it shall be by thy guiding Light alone. Stray not from the path, for if thou dost, thy people shall be truly lost...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900050</h1>\n\n<p>Thou hast slain the Lord of Levin. A regrettable act...but a necessary one.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900060</h1>\n\n<p>In witnessing thy struggle, a truth hath been revealed unto me. If I mistake not, it may yet prove a chink in the eternal armor of the Ascians.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900070</h1>\n\n<p>But let us conclude our present business. I shall expound upon my findings at the Rising Stones anon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00010</h1>\n\n<p>You are returned to us, dear friend, and none the worse for bearing the heavy burden which I did press upon you. Most glad am I of this.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00020</h1>\n\n<p>I am informed that your efforts to negotiate a peace with Lord Ramuh ended in conflict. Pray tell me, what befell?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00030</h1>\n\n<p>Ramuh made trial of you?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00040</h1>\n\n<p>I fear there is truth to his claim. It is the darkness within us that attracts the Darkness without.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00050</h1>\n\n<p>It cannot be denied that misfortune follows man. For evidence, one need only look to the conflict brewing in Carteneau, or to the rising flood of refugees.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00060</h1>\n\n<p>Our shared struggle against the Empire should have served to seal our union, yet the ties which bind the Alliance strain under the weight of gross self-interest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00070</h1>\n\n<p>As the scars of the Calamity begin to fade, so too does our sense of common purpose.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00080</h1>\n\n<p>Yet now is scarce the time to forget our shared responsibility. If this new-sprung realm is to survive beyond its infancy, it must needs be nurtured by all.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00090</h1>\n\n<p>Eorzea must be as one. Yet I fear that dream is still far off.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00100</h1>\n\n<p>On behalf of the people of Gridania, and the elementals both, I thank you for all that you and your fellow Scions have done.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00110</h1>\n\n<p>Full oft have I been compelled to look to you for aid of late...and offered all too little in return. As leader of this nation, I shall endeavor to prove a more worthy ally to your cause henceforth.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00120</h1>\n\n<p>Lord Ramuh has departed, yet the keening of this ill wind grows no less insistent...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00130</h1>\n\n<p>Voices of the forest\u2500pray speak and I shall listen. What unseen evil begets this unease in my heart?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00010</h1>\n\n<p>If everyone is ready, let us begin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00020</h1>\n\n<p>Urianger, the floor is yours.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00030</h1>\n\n<p>As all here assembled now know, in its final hours as our order's headquarters, the Waking Sands did play host to a most unexpected visitor. I speak of the Ascian clad in white, Elidibus.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00040</h1>\n\n<p>Unwelcome though his presence was, his words that day did serve to confirm a truth long suspected: that the Ascians are eternal beings, to whom physical destruction is as a temporary inconvenience.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00050</h1>\n\n<p>In the intervening time, Urianger and I have striven to discover a means by which the Ascians might more permanently be slain.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00060</h1>\n\n<p>And 'tis my belief that we have found the thread that will allow us to unravel the twisted skein of their existence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00070</h1>\n\n<p>In the moments prior to Leviathan's most recent manifestation, the Sahagin elder who summoned him was observed to undergo some manner of ascension.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00080</h1>\n\n<p>The aetheric readings taken by Y'shtola at the time of this transfiguration have proven most enlightening.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00090</h1>\n\n<p>The disruption to the flow of aether was sudden and dramatic. So tangible was the agitation, I scarce had need of my goggles.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00100</h1>\n\n<p>The significance of Y'shtola's readings might better be understood in the context of mine own, taken at the instant of the Lord of Levin's demise. Unlike the primal, the Sahagin was not subject to aetheric dissipation.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00110</h1>\n\n<p>Before discussing our new discoveries, it may benefit us all to recall what we know of aetheric behavior.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00120</h1>\n\n<p>Let us begin at what some might call the end. When we who dwell in the material realm die, our spirits dissolve into the flow of aether, and are returned to the aetherial realm.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00130</h1>\n\n<p>In turn, the restless energy which suffuses that plane streams back into our world, giving rise to new life.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00140</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis as the heavens did decree\u2500the way of all mortal souls.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00150</h1>\n\n<p>'Twixt this world and the next do the aetherial currents swirl, bearing the very essence of life. Thus doth the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth continue unabated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00160</h1>\n\n<p>Primals behave somewhat differently. In order to manifest and then maintain a physical presence in this realm, they must consume vast quantities of aether, most often in the form of crystals. Though they may seem to live, their flesh is but aether given shape.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00170</h1>\n\n<p>Thus, a defeated primal leaves behind no broken corpse\u2500rather, the essence of its form seeps back into the land whence it came, and the energy of its shattered spirit is called back to the aetherial realm.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00180</h1>\n\n<p>And there it waiteth till next the prayers of the faithful do draw it forth from the sea of aether to take their offering of crystals and make for itself a new body...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00190</h1>\n\n<p>Which brings us on to the third group. These so-called \u201cimmortals.\u201d They exist in a manner all their own.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00200</h1>\n\n<p>Quite. Even as the Sahagin elder fell to the Admiral's musket shot, I witnessed the release of an aetherial cloud which immediately took possession of a nearby minion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00210</h1>\n\n<p>A soul that dissipateth not upon the death of the flesh...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00220</h1>\n\n<p>The secret of life everlasting. And in the claws of a Sahagin, no less. But I wonder: what would happen to one of these obstinate spirits should there be no suitable host for it to claim?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00230</h1>\n\n<p>If mortal death entails a return to the aetherial realm, it seems doubtful that the soul of an immortal would venture there.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00240</h1>\n\n<p>Nay, it merely withdraweth a distance. Unto the shore of the aetherial sea, perchance, but no further.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00250</h1>\n\n<p>Yes, it exists in neither this realm nor the next, abiding instead in the space that lies between them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00260</h1>\n\n<p>The Ascians took control of Thancred by means of a Crystal of Darkness\u2500an artifact which, if our theories are correct, serves as a gateway to the place I have just described.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00270</h1>\n\n<p>I was hoping people had forgotten about that...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00280</h1>\n\n<p>I am sorry, my friend.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00290</h1>\n\n<p>For a mercy, the weary road of our research hath brought us unto an answer.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00300</h1>\n\n<p>The Sahagin ascended to an immortal state, but he did not possess a Crystal of Darkness through which to flee this realm. Thus was he consumed by Leviathan.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00310</h1>\n\n<p>If we could entrap the spirits of defeated Ascians in like manner, and thereby deny them resurrection...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00320</h1>\n\n<p>Therein lieth the path to victory. Thou art most perceptive, my lady.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00330</h1>\n\n<p>Only when we have trapped the bodiless soul within an aetherial prison can we hope to defeat its unnatural constancy. Thus, might even an eternal Paragon be consigned to oblivion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00340</h1>\n\n<p>These feats are, of course, far easier said than done. At present, we lack a viable means to entrap and extinguish an Ascian soul.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00350</h1>\n\n<p>Yet I believe it to be possible. The pieces of the puzzle lie before us\u2500we have but to put them together.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00360</h1>\n\n<p>I will depart at once to convene with the sages of Sharlayan. Together shall we divine the steps by which our goals may be achieved.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00370</h1>\n\n<p>I have the utmost faith in you, Archon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00380</h1>\n\n<p>Beg pardon, Antecedent, but I would raise one final matter... Even now, a Sharlayan survey party seeketh to ascertain the fate of the Students of Baldesion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00390</h1>\n\n<p>Their findings shall soon be known to us. Though you harbor feelings of dread, I bid you surrender not to sorrow, but abide instead in hopeful prayer.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00400</h1>\n\n<p>I shall, Archon. Thank you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00010</h1>\n\n<p>Tell me, General: what think you of Alphinaud's bold endeavor?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00020</h1>\n\n<p>I think it is more than bold, Your Grace. His organization would pave the way for a united Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00030</h1>\n\n<p>Well do I understand his impatience. Since facing the common threat of the Ultima Weapon, our nations have seemed farther apart, not closer together.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00040</h1>\n\n<p>Considering the many problems we face, should we not be glad that someone else is taking the initiative?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00050</h1>\n\n<p>We have all pledged our cooperation, yet the grumbling continues behind closed doors. Ul'dah is not alone in her duplicity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00060</h1>\n\n<p>I myself have doubts as to the good this organization will achieve.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00070</h1>\n\n<p>With the inclusion of the finest soldiers of the three Grand Companies, it promises to be a fearsome military body. But whom will it serve? Even under the watchful gaze of the Scions, it is not unthinkable that such a force could perpetrate a great wrong.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00080</h1>\n\n<p>Does it not concern you that a significant proportion of its financial backing came from the coffers of the Syndicate? That those unprincipled worms might forge this extraordinary gathering of warriors into a private army?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00090</h1>\n\n<p>I have trust in the Scions, Your Grace. They have spared us no end of trouble at the hands of the primals. If they seek reinforcements, I deem it unwise to deny them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00100</h1>\n\n<p>As for their finances, full many gave generously. And though our nobles proffered a sizable sum, their coin did not spill from the pockets of Lolorito and his cronies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00110</h1>\n\n<p>And what of the presence of our stalwart adventurer friend in this endeavor? I doubt the Warrior of Light would betray our cause.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00120</h1>\n\n<p>Yes, there is that, I suppose.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00130</h1>\n\n<p>Yet I have known people to change. Whether we will or no, the events of the age hurl us this way and that, like a dust devil skipping across the sands...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00140</h1>\n\n<p>Can naught be done about Teledji?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00150</h1>\n\n<p>I have explored all avenues available to us, Your Grace, but as Ul'dahn law now stands, we lack the evidence to convict him of any crime. To arrest him on spurious grounds would only play into his hands...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00160</h1>\n\n<p>He has all but committed treason, and yet we can do nothing!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00170</h1>\n\n<p>Then what good our government!? What worth the royal house!?

    "text_clean": "000020 Ul'dah, on the other hand, is not. This riot was anything but an isolated incident. 000030 There is a restlessness in the air. Tensions long simmering are at last threatening to boil over. 000040 Ul'dah is a nation infamous for the great disparity between the wealthy and the poor. The majority of the populace accepts this state of affairs because they believe that every man bears responsibility for his own lot in life. 000050 To an Ul'dahn, money is the foremost and some would say the only measure of a man's worth. Small wonder that the wealthiest wield the greatest influence. 000060 So where do the refugees fit into this social hierarchy? What place is there for those who fled Ala Mhigo and the destruction of the Calamity? 000070 Plainly, there is none. They have no wealth, no power, and no worth. To the Ul'dahn way of thinking, they may as well not exist. 000080 Choosing to ignore their existence, however, is patently not an option. General Raubahn and the sultana understand this, which is why they ordered the Immortal Flames to provide the refugees aid and succor. 000090 Yet none would dispute that the expenses incurred by this policy grow by the day, with no end in sight. 000100 This has prompted more and more Ul'dahns to question their obligation to aid these worthless wanderers...  000110 While more and more refugees have come to resent their treatment at the hands of the sneering citizenry. 000120 The manner of Lord Lolorito's refusal to grant the Domans asylum bespoke a disdain for all refugees an attitude shared by the rest of the Monetarists. And you may be sure they make no effort to conceal their opinions. 000130 It was only a matter of time before the refugees united in protest. Nor is it any surprise that some among them would ultimately resort to violence. 000140 That the Immortal Flames should choose this of all occasions to engage in joint training exercises with the other Grand Companies... By the time they return, the situation may well have deteriorated beyond mending. 100010 Commander Swift has kept us apprised of your recent activities. You've made great strides towards quelling the violence. 100020 Despite our best efforts to determine what provoked this uprising, the truth continues to elude us. Have you uncovered aught which might shed some light on the mystery? 100030 This information does not leave this room. 100040 The Syndicate's decision to reject the Doman refugees' appeal for asylum had lasting repercussions. A number of those displaced by the Calamity claimed it was proof of a policy of discrimination. 100050 Together with a group of Ala Mhigan refugees, they organized a series of demonstrations to protest against the sultanate. 100060 Demonstrations which became heated, but did not descend into violence. 100070  Until a certain incident served as a call to arms. 100080 A unit of Brass Blades sent to supervise a demonstration loosed arrows upon unarmed protesters. 100090 It was this atrocity which prompted the refugees to take up arms. I need not tell you what followed. 100100 We assumed at first that the attack was born of a miscommunication. When emotions run high, they happen. But suspicions were raised regarding the unit's commanding officer, whom I ordered interrogated. 100110 Sure enough, our fears were soon confirmed. The dog confessed that a merchant had offered him coin to give the order a merchant in the employ of Teledji Adeledji. 100120 Teledji Adeledji? 100130 But he spoke in favor of the Domans' cause, and has ever seemed sympathetic towards the refugees' plight. Why would he do such a thing? 100140 Know you of the Carteneau Reclamation Bill? 100150 It is a proposal to annex the Carteneau Flats so that refugees may establish permanent settlements. 100160 When last I looked, that was disputed territory. 100170 Aye. Some might even call it a battlefield. 200010 The destruction wrought by Bahamut was greatest at the Carteneau Flats. That much is common knowledge. 200020 What is less well known is that his rampage laid bare ancient Allagan ruins, of which no record existed. 200030 There are certain...differences of opinion as to how these ruins should be handled, which is why each nation maintains a military presence in the region to this day. 200040 Yet differ though we may, we are still allies. Therefore, in the interest of preserving the Eorzean Alliance, we have reached an agreement. 200050 Any conflict which may arise during the course of military exercises in the region shall have no bearing on relations between our nations. 200060 In full knowledge of this delicate state of affairs, Teledji Adeledji proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill. 200070 A shameless bloody ruse which stands to benefit him in but one conceivable way. 200080 If successful, he will gain control over the disputed territory, under the guise of assisting in the resettlement effort. And you can be sure he'll build an orphanage next to every Allagan ruin. 200090 The man would threaten the unity of the Eorzean Alliance and risk countless lives for personal gain! 200100 He walks a path all his own, independent of any faction, and beholden to none of his fellows on the Syndicate. 200110 By inciting the less fortunate to violence, he hopes to convince others that the Carteneau Reclamation Bill is the only viable solution. 200120 His sympathy for the plight of the Domans was naught but posturing to gain credibility with the refugees. Of that there can be no doubt. 300010 Forgive me, but what could possibly motivate Teledji Adeledji to go to such lengths? What is so special about these ruins that he would risk his position on the Syndicate, and, most likely, charges of treason against the sultanate? 300020 Omega... 300030 Pardon? 300040 An Allagan monstrosity, not unlike the Ultima Weapon. Mayhap larger. We know not. It has yet to be fully excavated. 300050 Allagan inscriptions indicate that it was created to fell Bahamut himself. 300060 If accurate, it might explain why Nael van Darnus chose to bring the red moon down upon the Carteneau Flats. 300070 Given the ends he went to to ensure Eorzea's annihilation, destroying the one weapon which could stay the elder primal may well have seemed like good sense. 300080 When first I bore witness to the power of the Ultima Weapon, I doubted the evidence of my senses... And now you tell me there is another such weapon one which could contend with Bahamut. Bahamut. 300090 Aye. We were skeptical ourselves. Truth be told, until the Ultima Weapon's existence came to light, we thought the inscription had been mistranslated. 300100 At present, Omega is more akin to a fossil than a tool of war, having long since ceased to function. As such, its true potential cannot accurately be gauged. 300110 However, if someone were to restore it, as the Garleans did the Ultima Weapon, I have little doubt that he would wield untold power. 300120 Power enough to subjugate Ul'dah, like as not, and the rest of Eorzea besides which is doubtless why Teledji Adeledji yearns to have it. 300130 That he should aspire to world domination... He who has ever walked two paces behind Lord Lolorito in matters of commerce. 300140 'Tis in acknowledgement of his own limitations that he seeks this power. Woe betide us all should we allow him to have it. 300150 Pray waste no time chasing rats. Only a fool would believe that secrets can be kept in Ul'dah. 300160 It would seem the implications of the sultanate's refugee problem are rather more far-reaching than we assumed... 400010 The incident with the new frontier hands? No, no, you need not elaborate I have been following their progress with no small amount of interest. 400020 Brave men and women all... They do our nation a great service. The existence of a fortified outpost in Mor Dhona will do much to dissuade the Empire from trespassing on Coerthan soil. 400030 Right glad am I that you have chosen to lend your support to this endeavor. Never let it be said that House Fortemps does not acknowledge the efforts of her allies...or her debts. 400040 'Twas in the spirit of gratitude that I arranged for sundry supplies to be delivered to Revenant's Toll. That the shipment should chance to be waylaid by heretics is poor fortune, indeed. 400050 Poor fortune, I say...yet not without precedent. If you would know the truth of it, these incorrigible villains grow more organized with each passing day. 400060 This new unity of purpose we attribute to their leader the Lady  Iceheart.  But though I have devoted significant resources to the task of identifying this woman, we have yet to learn so much as her birth name. 400070 What we do know is that the heretics speak of Iceheart in reverent tones, and would gladly embrace death rather than betray her. Such loyalty is rare indeed, and I fear to imagine what so committed a collective might achieve. 400080 The brigands have not yet been so brazen as to risk direct confrontation here in Dragonhead. Some few of their number have, however, been sighted not far to the west of here...and with ever-increasing regularity. 400090 A visit to Whitebrim Front may bring you the answers you seek. Will you brave the snows knowing what implacable foes may lie in wait? 400100 Halone's blessings be upon you! Though I take no pride in the admission, many of mine own countrymen are not so well suited as you adventurers to dealing with such foes. Were they dragons, it might be otherwise! 400110 But truly, I could not wish for a finer ally. You have done much for my house in the past, and I have no doubt but that I shall have cause to celebrate your deeds again ere long. 400120 Should you learn aught of value, pray return to me forthwith. A warm hearth and a warmer welcome shall be waiting for you. 500010 (-???-)Hmph... 600010 Your return is most timely. Of their own accord, my thoughts had turned to your task and the progress thereof. I confess, my imaginings tended toward the grim and bloody. 600020 But you are here now, and I suspect such frivolous wonderings do little justice to the reality of your travails. Tell me, what did you learn of Iceheart? 600030 ...Indeed. And this transpired at Snowcloak? 600040 Of all the highlands, that towering wall has borne the worst of the region's brutal shift in climate. 600050 So inhospitable has Snowcloak become that we have still to survey the area in its entirety. Could its frozen heights conceal the heretics' hideaway? Mayhap a more robust reconnaissance effort is in order. 600060 Putting such considerations aside for the moment, we still know far too little of this Iceheart. That she is capable of commanding such a band of fanatics bespeaks natural authority, and no small measure of charisma. 600070 As much as I would like to fathom this mystery with you, the situation has grown beyond my personal purview. I am bound by duty to inform the Temple Knights and request that they bring this matter to its conclusion. 600080 Given the glowing reports their new commander has garnered thus far, I am certain that they can be relied upon to take appropriate action. 600090 Though Iceheart's true identity yet eludes us, you have provided us with a point from which to begin. Sometimes it takes but a single stone to prompt an avalanche. 600100 On the matter of the stolen provisions, I have already made arrangements for a second shipment to be sent to Revenant's Toll. I could not well allow such an honorable venture to be undermined by one miserable setback! 700010 Scions of the Seventh Dawn, on behalf of the people of Gridania, I bid you welcome. Your presence is of great comfort to us all in these days of uncertainty. 700020 I summoned you here to share tidings of a most urgent nature. But a short while ago, the great elemental spoke, and his voice was clarion in its intensity: Ramuh is returned unto the forest. 700030 Scarce had his words ceased to echo in mine ears when we were visited by an emissary from Little Solace. 700050 Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin. 700055 Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin. 700060 Though his exact whereabouts remain unknown, we may safely assume that the primal was summoned within the heart of the Sylphlands. 700070 Unlike the other primals you have encountered, Lord Ramuh is no raging avatar of destruction. He is revered as much for his wisdom as his strength, serving as both arbiter and guardian to his children. Given that we and the sylphs found a way to share the Twelveswood, it is my hope that this sagely immortal will be amenable to reason, and that conflict may be avoided. 700080 Blessed as you are with the power of the Echo, you are one of the few among us who may commune with a primal without fear of influence. I would ask therefore that you represent us in this most delicate of negotiations. 700090 The Twelveswood has suffered enough. Upon this, we and the sylphs and I would venture Lord Ramuh himself are in perfect accord. Let us not endanger our shared home by engaging in unnecessary hostilities. 700100 Dear friend, I beseech you: safeguard the peace which exists between our peoples. 700110 You have my thanks. 700120 Pray make for Little Solace, then. A member of the Order of the Twin Adder awaits you there. He will advise you on how to find the Lord of Levin. 700130 An ill wind blows through the forest. 700140 Yet...it is not only the Twelveswood that flinches at its coming all the lands of Eorzea shiver in dread anticipation. Have care. 800010 Thine aura betrays thee, servant of Hydaelyn. 800020 Thou art the Bringer of Light...bane of Ifrit, Titan, Garuda, and Leviathan. 800030 I am Ramuh, guardian of the children of the forest. 800040 Thou tramplest upon sacred soil, Bringer of Light. By what right doth man intrude in this sanctuary of the sylphs? 800050 The Gridanians proffer peace? Their words are born of delusion thine offer, an insult. 800060 Thou speakest of harmony, yet carest naught for my children's desires. They did but wish to dwell beneath these boughs in solitude yet even that was too much to ask of man. 800070 Thus did they turn to me for succor. The sentence I pronounce upon thy kind is just. 800080 Gridanian or Garlean, it matters not. The good intent of one excuseth not the misdeeds of the other. 800090 Thy conflicts have brought naught but anguish and misery unto the forest. All blame doth lie with the darkness that resideth in the breast of man. 800100 Whence sprung this calamitous seed? In the beginning, no such duality existed. Were light and dark given form when man was born? 800110 It would explain much. Not least why strife and sorrow follow ever in thy wake. Thou canst not deny the urgings of thine own nature. 800120 Knowing that thy mere presence here portendeth tragedy, wilt thou persist in this pretense of peacemaking? 800130 Thou bearest the crystal which I bestowed upon my wayward charges. That they should entrust so precious a gift to thee... 800140 Thou standest apart from thy kin. Thou art the Bringer of Light, aye...but there is something more in thee... 800150 Very well, I shall consider thy proposal...shouldst thou survive my trial. 800160 If thou wouldst champion the cause of harmony, I must have proof that thou art fit to play the role. Weather mine ire, and prove to me thereby that thou hast strength enough to stay the Darkness which threateneth to consume thee. 800170 Yet if thou shouldst be found wanting, know that all men shall perish in the storm of my judgment! 800180 Come to me, Bringer of Light. I shall await thee on the field of battle! 800190 Urianger. It is rare indeed to find you so far from a tome. 800200 The Lord of Levin himself... Never till this day had I looked upon his visage save in painted renderings, made faint by time... Ever shall this scene remain etched in my mind's eye... Ahem. Beg pardon, my lady. 800210 I must beg thine aid on a point of research. If thou art resolved to face Lord Ramuh, I would ask thy leave to observe the event... 900010 I have taken thy measure, Bringer of Light. 900020 And I judge thee a worthy champion. The task of excising the sin that hath taken root in man's heart is thine. 900030 Shrink not from employing thy strength in service to the forest, and the wider realm beyond. Like hungering shadows do the enemies of harmony gather, and meekness will but feed them. 900040 If man is to be delivered from the Dark, it shall be by thy guiding Light alone. Stray not from the path, for if thou dost, thy people shall be truly lost... 900050 Thou hast slain the Lord of Levin. A regrettable act...but a necessary one. 900060 In witnessing thy struggle, a truth hath been revealed unto me. If I mistake not, it may yet prove a chink in the eternal armor of the Ascians. 900070 But let us conclude our present business. I shall expound upon my findings at the Rising Stones anon. A00010 You are returned to us, dear friend, and none the worse for bearing the heavy burden which I did press upon you. Most glad am I of this. A00020 I am informed that your efforts to negotiate a peace with Lord Ramuh ended in conflict. Pray tell me, what befell? A00030 Ramuh made trial of you? A00040 I fear there is truth to his claim. It is the darkness within us that attracts the Darkness without. A00050 It cannot be denied that misfortune follows man. For evidence, one need only look to the conflict brewing in Carteneau, or to the rising flood of refugees. A00060 Our shared struggle against the Empire should have served to seal our union, yet the ties which bind the Alliance strain under the weight of gross self-interest. A00070 As the scars of the Calamity begin to fade, so too does our sense of common purpose. A00080 Yet now is scarce the time to forget our shared responsibility. If this new-sprung realm is to survive beyond its infancy, it must needs be nurtured by all. A00090 Eorzea must be as one. Yet I fear that dream is still far off. A00100 On behalf of the people of Gridania, and the elementals both, I thank you for all that you and your fellow Scions have done. A00110 Full oft have I been compelled to look to you for aid of late...and offered all too little in return. As leader of this nation, I shall endeavor to prove a more worthy ally to your cause henceforth. A00120 Lord Ramuh has departed, yet the keening of this ill wind grows no less insistent... A00130 Voices of the forest pray speak and I shall listen. What unseen evil begets this unease in my heart? B00010 If everyone is ready, let us begin. B00020 Urianger, the floor is yours. B00030 As all here assembled now know, in its final hours as our order's headquarters, the Waking Sands did play host to a most unexpected visitor. I speak of the Ascian clad in white, Elidibus. B00040 Unwelcome though his presence was, his words that day did serve to confirm a truth long suspected: that the Ascians are eternal beings, to whom physical destruction is as a temporary inconvenience. B00050 In the intervening time, Urianger and I have striven to discover a means by which the Ascians might more permanently be slain. B00060 And 'tis my belief that we have found the thread that will allow us to unravel the twisted skein of their existence. B00070 In the moments prior to Leviathan's most recent manifestation, the Sahagin elder who summoned him was observed to undergo some manner of ascension. B00080 The aetheric readings taken by Y'shtola at the time of this transfiguration have proven most enlightening. B00090 The disruption to the flow of aether was sudden and dramatic. So tangible was the agitation, I scarce had need of my goggles. B00100 The significance of Y'shtola's readings might better be understood in the context of mine own, taken at the instant of the Lord of Levin's demise. Unlike the primal, the Sahagin was not subject to aetheric dissipation. B00110 Before discussing our new discoveries, it may benefit us all to recall what we know of aetheric behavior. B00120 Let us begin at what some might call the end. When we who dwell in the material realm die, our spirits dissolve into the flow of aether, and are returned to the aetherial realm. B00130 In turn, the restless energy which suffuses that plane streams back into our world, giving rise to new life. B00140 'Tis as the heavens did decree the way of all mortal souls. B00150 'Twixt this world and the next do the aetherial currents swirl, bearing the very essence of life. Thus doth the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth continue unabated. B00160 Primals behave somewhat differently. In order to manifest and then maintain a physical presence in this realm, they must consume vast quantities of aether, most often in the form of crystals. Though they may seem to live, their flesh is but aether given shape. B00170 Thus, a defeated primal leaves behind no broken corpse rather, the essence of its form seeps back into the land whence it came, and the energy of its shattered spirit is called back to the aetherial realm. B00180 And there it waiteth till next the prayers of the faithful do draw it forth from the sea of aether to take their offering of crystals and make for itself a new body... B00190 Which brings us on to the third group. These so-called  immortals.  They exist in a manner all their own. B00200 Quite. Even as the Sahagin elder fell to the Admiral's musket shot, I witnessed the release of an aetherial cloud which immediately took possession of a nearby minion. B00210 A soul that dissipateth not upon the death of the flesh... B00220 The secret of life everlasting. And in the claws of a Sahagin, no less. But I wonder: what would happen to one of these obstinate spirits should there be no suitable host for it to claim? B00230 If mortal death entails a return to the aetherial realm, it seems doubtful that the soul of an immortal would venture there. B00240 Nay, it merely withdraweth a distance. Unto the shore of the aetherial sea, perchance, but no further. B00250 Yes, it exists in neither this realm nor the next, abiding instead in the space that lies between them. B00260 The Ascians took control of Thancred by means of a Crystal of Darkness an artifact which, if our theories are correct, serves as a gateway to the place I have just described. B00270 I was hoping people had forgotten about that... B00280 I am sorry, my friend. B00290 For a mercy, the weary road of our research hath brought us unto an answer. B00300 The Sahagin ascended to an immortal state, but he did not possess a Crystal of Darkness through which to flee this realm. Thus was he consumed by Leviathan. B00310 If we could entrap the spirits of defeated Ascians in like manner, and thereby deny them resurrection... B00320 Therein lieth the path to victory. Thou art most perceptive, my lady. B00330 Only when we have trapped the bodiless soul within an aetherial prison can we hope to defeat its unnatural constancy. Thus, might even an eternal Paragon be consigned to oblivion. B00340 These feats are, of course, far easier said than done. At present, we lack a viable means to entrap and extinguish an Ascian soul. B00350 Yet I believe it to be possible. The pieces of the puzzle lie before us we have but to put them together. B00360 I will depart at once to convene with the sages of Sharlayan. Together shall we divine the steps by which our goals may be achieved. B00370 I have the utmost faith in you, Archon. B00380 Beg pardon, Antecedent, but I would raise one final matter... Even now, a Sharlayan survey party seeketh to ascertain the fate of the Students of Baldesion. B00390 Their findings shall soon be known to us. Though you harbor feelings of dread, I bid you surrender not to sorrow, but abide instead in hopeful prayer. B00400 I shall, Archon. Thank you. C00010 Tell me, General: what think you of Alphinaud's bold endeavor? C00020 I think it is more than bold, Your Grace. His organization would pave the way for a united Eorzea. C00030 Well do I understand his impatience. Since facing the common threat of the Ultima Weapon, our nations have seemed farther apart, not closer together. C00040 Considering the many problems we face, should we not be glad that someone else is taking the initiative? C00050 We have all pledged our cooperation, yet the grumbling continues behind closed doors. Ul'dah is not alone in her duplicity. C00060 I myself have doubts as to the good this organization will achieve. C00070 With the inclusion of the finest soldiers of the three Grand Companies, it promises to be a fearsome military body. But whom will it serve? Even under the watchful gaze of the Scions, it is not unthinkable that such a force could perpetrate a great wrong. C00080 Does it not concern you that a significant proportion of its financial backing came from the coffers of the Syndicate? That those unprincipled worms might forge this extraordinary gathering of warriors into a private army? C00090 I have trust in the Scions, Your Grace. They have spared us no end of trouble at the hands of the primals. If they seek reinforcements, I deem it unwise to deny them. C00100 As for their finances, full many gave generously. And though our nobles proffered a sizable sum, their coin did not spill from the pockets of Lolorito and his cronies. C00110 And what of the presence of our stalwart adventurer friend in this endeavor? I doubt the Warrior of Light would betray our cause. C00120 Yes, there is that, I suppose. C00130 Yet I have known people to change. Whether we will or no, the events of the age hurl us this way and that, like a dust devil skipping across the sands... C00140 Can naught be done about Teledji? C00150 I have explored all avenues available to us, Your Grace, but as Ul'dahn law now stands, we lack the evidence to convict him of any crime. To arrest him on spurious grounds would only play into his hands... C00160 He has all but committed treason, and yet we can do nothing!? C00170 Then what good our government!? What worth the royal house!? How deplorable this mockery of justice! C00180 This isn't the text you're looking for. C00190 Have faith, Your Grace. It is not over... D00010 Comrades! Your presence here this day signifies the momentous choice that each of you has made. D00020 With your strength now pledged to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, you are beholden to no single nation. You stand as the vanguard for a united Eorzea! D00030 From this moment forth, I declare you Crystal Braves! Let us mend this fractured realm, and face our enemies as one! D00040 Whether it be the beastmen and their primals, or the conflict in Carteneau, it is plain that the nations of Eorzea cannot solve the problems which plague the realm. Thus does it fall to some few heroic souls to succeed where they have failed! D00050 Come! Take your place at the Scions' side as guardians of Eorzea! And together we shall fight for the freedom of all! D00060 (-Crystal Braves-)For the freedom of all! D00070 A rousing speech, Alphinaud. Or should I say, Crystal Brave Commander Leveilleur? D00080 Please, Antecedent...the title is honorary. I shall not be  leading the troops into battle,  as it were. D00090 We are of the same purpose. Let us join hands, and do what must be done to save this land. D00100 The Scions stand ready! E00010 I'm eager to see what the Crystal Braves might accomplish. This shall prove an interesting time indeed for the Scions. E00020 Yes, I'm listening. E00030 So, our worst fears are confirmed. The entire isle... Such power defies comprehension... E00040 Truly!? Krile is alive!? Thank the Twelve... E00050 ...I see. Pray inform me if her condition changes. Yes. I shall pass on your words to Urianger. E00060 My thanks. I shall contact you anon. E00070 When I learned of the loss of the Isle of Val, I dared not hope that my friend had survived. Yet by some miracle, it would seem she has. She's still to regain consciousness, it is true, but better that than death. E00080 Putting this happy news to one side, we must now endeavor to make sense of the readings taken by the survey party. E00090 It appears the aetheric disturbance which accompanied the isle's destruction is of a magnitude alarmingly close to that of Ultima. Could the Ascians be responsible for this devastation as well? E00100 I wonder... Have you heard aught from the Mothercrystal since the battle with the Garleans? E00110 Then She speaks to neither one of us. Hydaelyn's silence portends naught but ill, I fear.  E00120 Louisoix... I pray you yet watch over us...",

Given the sensitive nature of the task, I could not rely on one of my own.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000040</h1>\n\n<p>That which I am about to tell you, I tell you in the strictest confidence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000050</h1>\n\n<p>Some days ago, we received certain documents from an anonymous source. They notified us of the presence of a Garlean agent within the ranks of one of the Grand Companies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000060</h1>\n\n<p>Following some discreet inquiries, we identified a suspect among the Immortal Flames whom we detained for questioning.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000070</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, the man was not our agent. He was but one of many men in the agent's employ.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000080</h1>\n\n<p>We pressed the traitor for a name, but he had none to give. He claims never to have met his master, whom he knows only as the Ivy.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000090</h1>\n\n<p>He was, however, certain that this \u201civy\u201d had coiled itself around every part of the Immortal Flames. It would seem our quarry joined the company some time ago, and gradually recruited others to his cause.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000100</h1>\n\n<p>These conspirators are the vines by which he learns our secrets, all without exposing himself.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000110</h1>\n\n<p>It won't be easy to identify the Ivy amidst this tangled mass of subterfuge. But we have a tendril in our hands, and we shall follow it all the way to the gnarled root.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000120</h1>\n\n<p>Now, much as I would prefer to proceed with due discretion, circumstances demand that this matter be settled posthaste.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000130</h1>\n\n<p>Garlemald's war of succession nears its end, and it is feared that the Empire will soon resume its march on Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000140</h1>\n\n<p>When it does, we can ill afford to have traitors in our midst. The Ivy must be rooted out now.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000150</h1>\n\n<p>We must begin by apprising General Raubahn of our findings. I would ask that you accompany me to the Hall of Flames, and remain on hand to see that things go smoothly.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000160</h1>\n\n<p>Assuming the Ivy's tendrils are as widespread as we believe, he will be aware that an investigation is underway. And if that is the case, he may well move against us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000170</h1>\n\n<p>We must be prepared for anything, while taking care not to betray our purpose by seeming prepared. A simple enough task for a one-woman army like you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100010</h1>\n\n<p>Well, well. What brings you here, my friend?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100011</h1>\n\n<p>She is here at my behest. Greetings, Raubahn. It has been a while.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100020</h1>\n\n<p>Ilberd, you old scoundrel! When they told me you'd be visiting, I scarce believed my ears!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100030</h1>\n\n<p>But look at you! The honored captain of the Crystal bloody Braves! Who'd have imagined, eh?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100040</h1>\n\n<p>Not many. But fewer still would have imagined your destiny lay in politics, old friend.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100050</h1>\n\n<p>Aye...we've both come far, have we not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100060</h1>\n\n<p>Lest you wonder, Ilberd and I go back a long way. We've been friends and rivals since we were lads.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100070</h1>\n\n<p>The last time we saw each other, Ala Mhigo had just fallen, so you can guess how many summers it's been. And in all that time, not a word from the fool!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100080</h1>\n\n<p>Ah, well, my dealings tended toward the modest and mundane...unlike some I could mention.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100090</h1>\n\n<p>As I hear it, no sooner did you reach Thanalan than the Brass Blades clapped you in irons and dragged you off to die on the bloodsands. But being a stubborn sort, you won a thousand matches, and earned yourself a place in the people's hearts while you were about it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100100</h1>\n\n<p>Then, with your mountain of prize money, you bought the Coliseum, and secured a seat on the Syndicate. Thal's balls, brother\u2500rags-to-riches does not do it justice! You're a hero to the common man!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100110</h1>\n\n<p>Bah, spare me. I am no hero. If anyone is worthy of that title, it's our friend here. Next to her, I'm little more than a glorified butcher.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100120</h1>\n\n<p>But you, Ilberd\u2500you sell yourself short. By all accounts, you were an adventurer of some standing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100130</h1>\n\n<p>I like to think that I did my part for the greater good. But if you are no hero, then I am no adventurer\u2500not in this company. Anyway...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100140</h1>\n\n<p>I have tidings.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100150</h1>\n\n<p>So there has been progress.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100160</h1>\n\n<p>I've let it be known that this meeting is a reunion between old friends. None will give your visit a second thought.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100170</h1>\n\n<p>To convene elsewhere would only attract attention. Let us speak here, in plain view of all.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100180</h1>\n\n<p>...So it is we who have been compromised.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100190</h1>\n\n<p>Teledji Adeledji's machinations have shaken Ul'dah to her foundations. In such uncertain times, a man's loyalty may be bought for a fistful of gil...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100200</h1>\n\n<p>But if this snake has truly been in our midst for as long as you say, we must needs consider a far graver possibility: conspiracy. Could it be that the Monetarists have been in league with the Empire from the first?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100210</h1>\n\n<p>Very well. I will have my most trusted men investigate the matter. Continue your inquiries in the meantime.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100220</h1>\n\n<p>It does me well to see you again, old friend. When next we meet, let it be over a flagon of ale.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100230</h1>\n\n<p>I look forward to it. Let us reminisce of bygone days, and drink to the future of our homeland.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100240</h1>\n\n<p>Flame General... You wear the mantle well, old friend. I must work hard if I'm to keep up.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100250</h1>\n\n<p>Well, it would seem your services were not required after all. I daresay we have Raubahn's prudence to thank for that. Still, I was glad of your presence. My thanks, Scion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300010</h1>\n\n<p>Have faith, my friend. You need only state your case with confidence and clarity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300020</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Commander Leveilleur. It is both an honor and a pleasure to meet you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300030</h1>\n\n<p>I am Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300040</h1>\n\n<p>Alphinaud Leveilleur, at your service.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300050</h1>\n\n<p>Your reputation precedes you, Ser Aymeric. I think we will find that we have much in common.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300060</h1>\n\n<p>Speaking of reputations, yours towers over us all. Does it not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300080</h1>\n\n<p>(-Taciturn Temple Knight-)It does indeed, Lord Commander.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300090</h1>\n\n<p>I am not too proud to admit that I have followed your activities with an interest bordering on fascination.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300100</h1>\n\n<p>Full glad was I to learn that you would be joining us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300110</h1>\n\n<p>Now then, shall we begin?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300120</h1>\n\n<p>We know full well that the Garleans will return in force ere long.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300130</h1>\n\n<p>What is more, we have yet to achieve a lasting victory over the primal menace. The beast tribes continue to summon their gods, and each incarnation is stronger than the last.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300140</h1>\n\n<p>Ishgard is not immune to these threats. I must reiterate that it would behoove your nation to rejoin the Eorzean Alliance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300150</h1>\n\n<p>Once again, I must respectfully disagree.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300160</h1>\n\n<p>On what grounds?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300170</h1>\n\n<p>Despite their presence in Coerthas, the Ixal do not concern us. Their territorial claims pertain to Gridanian lands, and it is the people of Gridania whom they harry.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300180</h1>\n\n<p>Consequently, the Holy See judges this to be a Gridanian affair, and Ishgard does not intervene in the internal affairs of other nations.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300190</h1>\n\n<p>Even were that not the case, our forces are wholly committed to the Dravanian conflict. We have not the knights to spare.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300200</h1>\n\n<p>As for the Garleans, we are not ignorant of history. We have observed the rise and expansion of the Empire, and we agree that it is only a matter of time before they resume their campaign in Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300220</h1>\n\n<p>Then surely it would be in our best interests to present a united front?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300230</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap one day, but not yet.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300240</h1>\n\n<p>Gaius van Baelsar is dead, and the legion of conscripts he left behind lacks the will to fight. We think it highly unlikely that they will emerge from behind the walls of their castra for some time.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300250</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive me, but if Ishgard's position has not changed, why did you agree to this meeting?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300260</h1>\n\n<p>It was not only as a representative of Ishgard that I came here.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300270</h1>\n\n<p>Pardon?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300280</h1>\n\n<p>It is not within my power to change Ishgardian policy, regardless of my personal feelings. There is, however, one area in which I may exert a measure of influence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300290</h1>\n\n<p>Concerns have been raised over the supplies House Fortemps has offered to Revenant's Toll. These have led to calls for restrictions on the provision of aid to foreign powers.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300300</h1>\n\n<p>I can ensure that the shipments continue unabated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300310</h1>\n\n<p>Ser Aymeric, we would be in your debt!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300320</h1>\n\n<p>No, you would not, for I require something in exchange.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300330</h1>\n\n<p>Of late there has been a flurry of Dravanian activity, the purpose of which was not immediately clear.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300340</h1>\n\n<p>However, our astrologians have since observed alarming changes in the heavens. The dragon star waxes unnaturally bright, and there are whispers that it portends the resurrection of Midgardsormr.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300350</h1>\n\n<p>The fallen guardian of Silvertear Falls? That's absurd.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300360</h1>\n\n<p>Full many times have I gazed upon the dragon's corpse, still wound around the Agrius, and wondered how different our world might be if it yet lived to plague the skies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300370</h1>\n\n<p>I do not know, and I do not wish to know. Nor does any son of Ishgard. Yet the mere presence of Dravanian forces is not sufficient grounds to send knights to Mor Dhona, whatever our astrologians say. As I told you before, we have not the forces to spare.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300380</h1>\n\n<p>...But we do. So, you will intervene on our behalf if we agree to watch over the Keeper of the Lake.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300390</h1>\n\n<p>Do you accept these terms?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300400</h1>\n\n<p>I do. I will see that you are kept abreast of any developments.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300410</h1>\n\n<p>I regret that we could not come to a similar agreement on other matters, but I understand that you are not at liberty to make such decisions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300420</h1>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I hope that what we have accomplished here today will serve to demonstrate to your countrymen that we can work together towards a common goal. Mayhap one day we shall look back on this moment as the first step towards a united Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300440</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap we shall, Commander.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300450</h1>\n\n<p>What is the meaning of this!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300460</h1>\n\n<p>The caravan, my lord! It's been attacked!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300470</h1>\n\n<p>It was Iceheart, my lord!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300480</h1>\n\n<p>What!? By the Fury! All our precautions were for naught!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600010</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)The tales do not do you justice, Warrior of Light.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600020</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Yes, I know who you are. And you know who I am.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600030</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)I was given the name Ysayle, but I earned the name Iceheart.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600040</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)This endless cycle of hatred, of bloodshed, of sorrow\u2500 You would see it continue, O noble Warrior of Light?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600050</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)I would not. I will not. I will bring an end to this war between dragon and man\u2500no matter the cost.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600080</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)In time, you will come to understand that what we do, we do for the greater good.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600090</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)For Eorzea. For Hydaelyn.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900010</h1>\n\n<p>Change has come to the Garlean Empire, and we must discuss the implications.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900011</h1>\n\n<p>The rumors are true then? The war of succession is ended?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900020</h1>\n\n<p>It is. A new emperor reigns in Garlemald.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900030</h1>\n\n<p>Who!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900040</h1>\n\n<p>The birth and all-too-rapid expansion of the Garlean Empire is commonly attributed to the strategic brilliance of Solus zos Galvus, yet he did not rule alone. Several members of the royal household also distinguished themselves during his reign.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900050</h1>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, it was the eldest son who stood to inherit the throne\u2500until his most untimely passing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900060</h1>\n\n<p>I thought us fortunate when I learned that the Emperor had died without naming a successor.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900070</h1>\n\n<p>Would that the Garlean Empire had died with him.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900080</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas the grandson and his uncle who had the strongest claims, was it not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900090</h1>\n\n<p>Indeed. Yet claims count for little without the power to assert them. High Legatus Varis yae Galvus is a respected military leader\u2500not so, his uncle.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900100</h1>\n\n<p>So, young Varis has torn the crown from his uncle's grasp, and taken his place at the head of the Empire.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900120</h1>\n\n<p>Given the troubled nature of his succession, the new emperor will require time to seal his grip on power. Yet have no doubt but that he shall, for there are none left with strength enough to oppose him.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900130</h1>\n\n<p>Since the success of Operation Archon, the remnants of the XIVth Legion and the forces occupying Ala Mhigo have done naught but fortify their positions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900140</h1>\n\n<p>But you can be sure they'll be ready to march on us again, if their emperor gives the word.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900150</h1>\n\n<p>When, not if. They say this Varis was so set upon Eorzean annexation that he spoke out against the Meteor project.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900160</h1>\n\n<p>Plainly, the new emperor's intentions are of great concern to us all.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900170</h1>\n\n<p>I propose that we set aside the Carteneau dispute for the present and discuss what measures the Alliance might take to prepare for a resumption of hostilities with Garlemald.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900171</h1>\n\n<p>Moreover, I move that we reexamine the question of how our former allies in Ishgard might be persuaded to retake their place at our side. Could Eorzea but stand as one, 'twould deal a grave blow to our enemy's ambitions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900180</h1>\n\n<p>Well, I suppose we should be grateful that they have finally acknowledged the inevitability of imperial attack. Who knows, they may even do something about it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900190</h1>\n\n<p>If only the leaders of Ishgard would follow their example, and stop hiding behind their gates, praying for the coming storm to pass them by.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900200</h1>\n\n<p>But that is a discussion for another time. At present, I am more concerned by the fact that the Alliance's mooted preparations will be made known to the Garleans many moons before their coming.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900210</h1>\n\n<p>So long as the Ivy eludes our grasp, no secret is safe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00010</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Minfilia, am I right?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00020</h1>\n\n<p>None other. I bid you welcome to Revenant's Toll, and thank you for traveling so far on such short notice.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00030</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Hah! As if I could ever say no to Urianger!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00040</h1>\n\n<p>Moenbryda is an accomplished Sharlayan scholar and an authority on aetheryte technologies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00050</h1>\n\n<p>She has played an invaluable role in our search for a means to capture Ascian souls.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00060</h1>\n\n<p>Charmed, I'm sure.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00010</h1>\n\n<p>Everyone, if I could have your attention!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00011</h1>\n\n<p>We have with us an esteemed guest who is come from Sharlayan to assist us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00020</h1>\n\n<p>Moen!

Moen and I are like twin sisters!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00060</h1>\n\n<p>...Save in appearance and aptitude.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00070</h1>\n\n<p>Everyone, please!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00080</h1>\n\n<p>I bid Moenbryda join us here that she might share with us her extensive knowledge of aetherytes.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00090</h1>\n\n<p>Also, as many of you are already aware, she has been overseeing our research into white auracite\u2500a sample of which she has been good enough to bring with her.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00110</h1>\n\n<p>Well, I had to come, didn't I? You'd have to be bloody daft to turn your nose up at a chance like this. Where better to conduct my final tests than a land so steeped in aether you can taste it!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00120</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis plain the passage of the years hath done little to dampen thy youthful spirits...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00130</h1>\n\n<p>...And nothing at all to reform thy youthful manner.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00140</h1>\n\n<p>Urianger!

What was it you said? \u201cNone save thee can satisfy this need\u2500\u201d</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00180</h1>\n\n<p>Go on...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00190</h1>\n\n<p>Th-Thine artless attempts to misrepresent mine all-too-innocent motives do thee little credit!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00200</h1>\n\n<p>Mine intent, as well thou knowest, was but to impress upon thee the gravity of the circumstance. Lest thou doubt, a deiform entity shall shortly be summoned, save if thou, and no other, grantest my compeers thine aid.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00210</h1>\n\n<p>You still haven't found it, then? Your missing aetheryte?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00220</h1>\n\n<p>We have not, no.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00230</h1>\n\n<p>We know that Iceheart teleported to an aetheryte not far from the first, yet even after careful analysis, we could not locate the second beacon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00240</h1>\n\n<p>We now suspect that the heretics destroyed the second aetheryte to impede our pursuit.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00250</h1>\n\n<p>Our allies continue to scour Snowcloak for Iceheart's sanctuary, but we have no guarantee that they will find it. Yet it must be found, for even now Iceheart prepares to call upon Saint Shiva.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00260</h1>\n\n<p>I'm sorry but...if the aetheryte's been destroyed, then that's that.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00270</h1>\n\n<p>Although... You're absolutely sure she used the first aetheryte, are you? She didn't just use teleportation magicks?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00280</h1>\n\n<p>One of our own bore witness to her escape. I can say with absolute certainty that Iceheart used the aetheryte.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00290</h1>\n\n<p>In that case, there might be a way\u2500so long as the aetherial current is still flowing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00300</h1>\n\n<p>Truly? How?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00310</h1>\n\n<p>We use the current to recreate the beacon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00320</h1>\n\n<p>As you know, aetherytes are a bit like lighthouses. We use them to reconstitute our physical forms when crossing the aetherial sea. Without them, we'd lose all sense of direction and our essence would dissipate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00350</h1>\n\n<p>However, we don't rely solely on these beacons. There are currents of aether which flow between them\u2500currents which help guide us to our destination.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00360</h1>\n\n<p>Now, these currents will gradually dwindle away to nothing if an aetheryte is destroyed. But if even a sluggish flow remains, we could theoretically use it to direct a surge of concentrated aether towards the void left by the beacon and thereby fill it up again.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00380</h1>\n\n<p>Like opening the floodgates to fill a dry riverbed. Though, correct me if I'm wrong, but would we not need a veritable reservoir of aether?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00390</h1>\n\n<p>In concert, we might manage to channel a sufficient volume, yet that is not my chief concern.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00400</h1>\n\n<p>To direct the flow of so great a volume of aether with the requisite precision would be a nigh-impossible task in itself.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00410</h1>\n\n<p>I barely succeeded in facilitating travel to an unattuned beacon. That which you describe sounds considerably more difficult.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00420</h1>\n\n<p>And dangerous! Every person who has attempted to teleport in this fashion has died in the process. They, however, did not have white auracite at their disposal!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00440</h1>\n\n<p>I can use it to channel all the aether you can give me into the aetheryte. However, white auracite cannot retain aether for an extended period of time, so we would need to infuse it immediately beforehand.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00450</h1>\n\n<p>Just so you know, I'd confidently give this plan better than even odds of success. And if the worst comes to the worst, your people won't suffer.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00490</h1>\n\n<p>Though it risk the lives of our best and brightest, we have not the time to seek other options.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00500</h1>\n\n<p>If the aetherial current still flows, we shall carry out Moenbryda's plan.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00510</h1>\n\n<p>That's the spirit! Let's roll the dice!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00010</h1>\n\n<p>You should never have come here, Warrior of Light. I labor only to forge a lasting peace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00020</h1>\n\n<p>A peace you would deny us out of ignorance and blind faith.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00030</h1>\n\n<p>No matter. If it is our fate to be at odds, then it is mine to strike you down.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00040</h1>\n\n<p>We whom gods and men have forsaken shall be the instruments of our own deliverance!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00050</h1>\n\n<p>Partake of my flesh\u2500fill this vessel with your light! Walk amongst your brothers and sisters once more!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00060</h1>\n\n<p>O Saint Shiva, still the hatred within our hearts and bless us with eternal grace!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00070</h1>\n\n<p>Hmph...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00010</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Fool... Blind, bloody fool.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00020</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)You of all people should understand the suffering war begets\u2500that no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the violence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00021</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Mine is the righteous cause!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00030</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)You fight in a war you do not understand\u2500a pawn of liars and schemers.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00040</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)And they are no less ignorant than you! Following the creed of their fathers without question, never thinking to ask why.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00050</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Trapped in a delusion of their own creation and blind to the truth.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00060</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Warrior of Light, redemption is not beyond us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00070</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)We who walk before may lead those who walk after.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00080</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Seek the Keeper of the Lake.

Think...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00110</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)And so the vessel withdraws. A predictable outcome.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00120</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Nevertheless, Lahabrea will be pleased.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00130</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)How unfortunate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00010</h1>\n\n<p>On behalf of the Holy See of Ishgard, allow me to express my deepest thanks.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00020</h1>\n\n<p>Never before have we been required to contend with a primal. Indeed, there were fears in some quarters that our knights might not be equal to the task.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00030</h1>\n\n<p>From what we have now learned of these beings, I can say with certainty that we would have lost a great many men had the Scions not intervened.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00040</h1>\n\n<p>Then the argument for preemptive action should be self-evident. Perchance now you will reconsider my proposal that Ishgard move against Natalan?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00050</h1>\n\n<p>Ere we first met, a similar proposal was tabled\u2500but the Holy See decreed that we were to observe, and that military action should be taken only in self-defense.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00060</h1>\n\n<p>All things considered, it was not an unreasonable decision. Since the Calamity, two vigils have fallen to the Horde, while Garuda has never shown any inclination to storm the Gates of Judgement.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00070</h1>\n\n<p>...Which is why this unprecedented crisis and its resolution may prompt a change in policy.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00080</h1>\n\n<p>You who have faced these primals know well the threat they pose. Ishgard did not\u2500not until now.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00090</h1>\n\n<p>And there is naught like a brush with death to change a man's outlook.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00110</h1>\n\n<p>At the very least, this should silence any lingering objections to our arrangement with Revenant's Toll.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00120</h1>\n\n<p>The Holy See may even feel moved to grant us its formal endorsement.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00130</h1>\n\n<p>So far as it is possible, the Scions shall be compensated for their service.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00140</h1>\n\n<p>We should be grateful for any aid you can provide.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00150</h1>\n\n<p>As a gesture of good faith, I shall withdraw my previous request. Your people are doubtless needed elsewhere.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00160</h1>\n\n<p>That will not be necessary.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00170</h1>\n\n<p>We too have a vested interest in watching Dravania's movements.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00171</h1>\n\n<p>I see. Once more, I must thank you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00172</h1>\n\n<p>Ser Aymeric, if I may... Do you truly believe that Midgardsormr could return?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00180</h1>\n\n<p>The heavens are a window unto truth, but those who interpret their movements are not infallible. I requested your involvement as a precautionary measure.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00190</h1>\n\n<p>But of course... You sought an excuse to compensate us from the first, mindful of what would happen if Revenant's Toll were taken by your enemies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00200</h1>\n\n<p>Ishgard is not wont to aid its neighbors, but that does not preclude it from manipulating them to serve its own interests.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00210</h1>\n\n<p>(-Taciturn Temple Knight-)Choose your next words carefully.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00220</h1>\n\n<p>Do you know what sort of man becomes lord commander of the Temple Knights?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00230</h1>\n\n<p>One who comes from good stock. I did not, yet here I am. Now why do you suppose that is?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00240</h1>\n\n<p>Because I swiftly learned to tell the difference between words, deeds, and beliefs.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00250</h1>\n\n<p>...You are correct, Master Leveilleur. Ishgard desires to see Revenant's Toll flourish, as it would present a troublesome obstacle to our enemies from the south.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00260</h1>\n\n<p>We are so glad to be of use to you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00270</h1>\n\n<p>As we are to you. Ours is a mutually beneficial arrangement, lest we forget. One born of necessity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00280</h1>\n\n<p>The dragons grow more restless by the day, and the heretics harry us nigh without cease.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00290</h1>\n\n<p>We have contended with such troubles for centuries, but there are limits to even our endurance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00300</h1>\n\n<p>Yet as a pauper is loath to part with his meager possessions, the leaders of Ishgard are not wont to render up their trust to outsiders.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00310</h1>\n\n<p>But with perseverance on our part, they may yet be made to see the light.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00320</h1>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, one must take care when walking the road less traveled.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00330</h1>\n\n<p>Wise words, Ser Aymeric. I shall make a point to remember them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00340</h1>\n\n<p>I must apologize for my earlier outburst. I hope it will not sour our good relations.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00350</h1>\n\n<p>Not at all. You but spoke from the heart.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00360</h1>\n\n<p>I trust you understand that, at times, my duties may prevent me from meeting with you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00370</h1>\n\n<p>On such occasions, my second-in-command will speak for me.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00380</h1>\n\n<p>(-Lucia-)Lucia, at your service.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00390</h1>\n\n<p>(-Lucia-)Pray excuse our reticence.

I cannot thank you enough.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00490</h1>\n\n<p>Think nothing of it.

Can we be certain this entity was a primal?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00050</h1>\n\n<p>As certain as we can be that Good King Moggle Mog XII was a primal, I should think. Both were ostensibly summoned.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00060</h1>\n\n<p>Let's not quibble over definitions. Of more concern is the implication that Iceheart retained her will even after she was possessed. We are talking about a mortal wielding the power of a primal!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00070</h1>\n\n<p>It can't possibly be that easy, can it? There must be some sort of sacrifice required. Or maybe she's just special?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00080</h1>\n\n<p>What qualities this woman possesseth, I know not, but full sure am I that she was groomed for this role.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00090</h1>\n\n<p>Few are privy to the secrets of summoning, and but a single party standeth to profit from their dissemination.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00100</h1>\n\n<p>Well, I wouldn't presume to comment on how the lass came to know about summoning, but I will say that what she summoned was a primal. The readings were the same, or near as damn it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00110</h1>\n\n<p>Strange as it all sounds, it's really no different from what you've faced before.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00120</h1>\n\n<p>Then mayhap it is time that we reexamined our previous encounters.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00130</h1>\n\n<p>Pack your things, Yda. We're going back to Gridania.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00140</h1>\n\n<p>Yes sir!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00150</h1>\n\n<p>About Iceheart's final words to you...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00200</h1>\n\n<p>\"Hear... Feel... Think...\u201c</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00210</h1>\n\n<p>Hydaelyn speaks to her as well.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00211</h1>\n\n<p>If Iceheart is blessed with the power of the Echo, she will doubtless have used it to further her goals.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00212</h1>\n\n<p>...Or could it be that it was a revelation granted her by the Echo which first set her on this path? She did say that the Ishgardians were blind to the truth.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00213</h1>\n\n<p>Do you think she has knowledge of the origins of the Ishgardian-Dravanian war? It would do much to explain her unwavering conviction.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00220</h1>\n\n<p>Did not the Lady Iceheart implore thee to seek the Keeper of the Lake? And did she not imply that in so doing thou wouldst come to see with eyes unclouded?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00230</h1>\n\n<p>Midgardsormr was a king amongst kings who reigned for centuries on end... But he is dead, and his wisdom lost to the ages\u2500unless the Ishgardians' fears are well founded...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00240</h1>\n\n<p>It would seem we have yet another reason to stand watch over the Keeper of the Lake. For a mercy, we are well positioned to do so.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00280</h1>\n\n<p>Iceheart, Shiva, Ascians, and Midgardsormr. I shudder to think how they are all connected...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00010</h1>\n\n<p>I have heard. Truly bothersome business.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00020</h1>\n\n<p>No, I do not foresee a problem on that front. The main concern is Raubahn\u2500there is no telling what the brute might do.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00030</h1>\n\n<p>Have the Blades watch him and the Flames day and night.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00040</h1>\n\n<p>You may leave the sultana to me. I shall personally attend Her Grace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00050</h1>\n\n<p><sigh></p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00060</h1>\n\n<p>Sever one of the East Aldenard trade routes. That ought to keep Lolorito occupied for a while.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00070</h1>\n\n<p>Nanamo Ul Namo... For my sake, pray be a good little sultana to the last.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00010</h1>\n\n<p>Welcome back, my friend. I have already received word from Alphinaud.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00011</h1>\n\n<p>To think that Flame Marshal Roaille was the Garlean agent... I know not what to say.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00020</h1>\n\n<p>Together with Raubahn, Eline lent us much-needed aid at the time of our order's founding. She was particularly passionate about the need to tackle the primal threat.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00030</h1>\n\n<p>When we discussed the subject, her eyes fairly shone with determination. Whatever else she may have been, I choose to believe that it was her true self with whom I spoke then...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00040</h1>\n\n<p>But now is not the time to dwell on such matters.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00050</h1>\n\n<p>I have an important announcement to make regarding our effort to defeat the Ascians. We shall begin as soon as everyone is assembled.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00060</h1>\n\n<p>My thanks for coming, friends. Moenbryda, the floor is yours.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00070</h1>\n\n<p>By now, I'm sure you're all familiar with white auracite, the miraculous material that'll allow us to capture Ascian souls.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00080</h1>\n\n<p>Back at Snowcloak, we verified its ability to absorb vast amounts of aether.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00090</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, it leaves something to be desired in the area of stability. The stone can only store aether for a short while before expelling its contents.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00100</h1>\n\n<p>In addition to auracite's inherent limitations, we must needs be wary of our enemy's strength.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00110</h1>\n\n<p>Our foe draweth upon an infinite wellspring of power. Even should we succeed in entrapping him, the stone will not long contain his wrath.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00120</h1>\n\n<p>Meaning that if we want to kill the swine, we'll have to be quick about it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00130</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis our belief that an Ascian soul may be permanently undone if smitten by a sufficiently concentrated burst of pure aether.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00140</h1>\n\n<p>The only trouble is, we can't say for sure how concentrated the burst needs to be... Without knowing how much aether an Ascian soul is composed of, we're basically guessing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00150</h1>\n\n<p>Our sole clue lieth in thy struggle with Lahabrea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00160</h1>\n\n<p>During that encounter, Hydaelyn bid you forge what She called \u201ca blade of Light,\u201d a weapon which took the form of a luminous stream of energy.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00170</h1>\n\n<p>Based on your description, we believe the \u201cblade\u201d with which you vanquished your foe was composed of aether.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00180</h1>\n\n<p>Admittedly, your victory proved ephemeral, as Lahabrea was able to use a Crystal of Darkness to flee into the space that lies between our world and the void.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00190</h1>\n\n<p>The fact remains, however, that Hydaelyn placed the means to destroy the Ascians in your hands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00200</h1>\n\n<p>Be that as it may, it would be unwise to assume that She will do the same when next we encounter such a foe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00210</h1>\n\n<p>Quite so, my lady. We must needs find the means to forge our own blade of aether\u2500one to equal that which Hydaelyn did benevolently bestow upon Her champion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00220</h1>\n\n<p>That is all well and good, but it seems to me that producing such a blade will require a prodigious quantity of aether. Whence will it come, pray tell?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00230</h1>\n\n<p>Ummm... Oh! What if we had two pieces of white auracite? One to trap the Ascian, and the other to store the aether for the blade!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00240</h1>\n\n<p>Nice try, but it's as I said: the stone won't hold aether for any length of time. We'd still need to collect the stuff there and then, sorry to say.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00250</h1>\n\n<p>And therein lies the rub: finding a way to create the blade whenever and wherever we choose.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00260</h1>\n\n<p>'Twould seem more research is in order.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00270</h1>\n\n<p>I'm going to linger awhile\u2500perform a few more tests on the auracite.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00280</h1>\n\n<p>And I could do with some help. Urianger, why don't you lend me a hand?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00290</h1>\n\n<p>M-Mine apologies, but I am required at the Waking Sands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00300</h1>\n\n<p>Lady Minfilia hath given me sole charge of the premises. 'Twould be unseemly to leave them unattended.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00310</h1>\n\n<p>\"Sole charge,\u201c you say? So...you're basically alone there, then? Well, that settles it! I'll just have to come to you!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00320</h1>\n\n<p>While you were afield, word arrived from the Sharlayan motherland.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00330</h1>\n\n<p>You will recall that a survey party was dispatched to investigate the incident at the Isle of Val. What they discovered was troubling to say the least.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00340</h1>\n\n<p>According to the report, the isle has been erased from existence. 'Twas as if a hole had been torn in the very fabric of reality.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00350</h1>\n\n<p>Aye...yet the mystery endeth not with the isle's disappearance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00360</h1>\n\n<p>It hath come to light that a number of scholars in various other locales were reported missing at a similar juncture.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00370</h1>\n\n<p>What's more, they all had something in common with the head of the Students of Baldesion. Every last one of them was researching a phenomenon called dimensional compression\u2500or the \u201cRejoining,\u201d as the ancient texts call it. I'll be damned if that's a coincidence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00380</h1>\n\n<p>All indications suggest Ascian involvement, but I sense that a force greater still is at work\u2500the entity the dark beings call \u201cthe one true god\u201d...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00390</h1>\n\n<p>We must pray that my dear friend Krile regains consciousness soon. If she bore witness to the Isle of Val's final moments, she may be able to shed some light on this mystery...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00010</h1>\n\n<p>Following the Calamity, the forces of the XIVth Imperial Legion entrenched themselves in strategic locations across Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00020</h1>\n\n<p>So swiftly did they accomplish this, it was suspected that they had received help. To think that it came from Roaille... My right hand.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00030</h1>\n\n<p>There is more. We have reason to believe that Roaille didn't deal exclusively with the XIVth. She also answered to a higher authority in Garlemald.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00040</h1>\n\n<p>But this higher authority could not have been the Emperor. By consenting to the Meteor project, Solus zos Galvus showed himself to be more concerned about preventing the spread of primal influence than claiming Eorzea for the Empire. He would happily have seen the lot reduced to ash.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00050</h1>\n\n<p>We believe a number of high-ranking figures within the royal household were against the decision, but that they knew better than to oppose the Emperor openly. Of course, this didn't prevent them from making clandestine provisions, in which Roaille played a part.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00060</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, these provisions did not prevent Dalamud from falling, and the ensuing chaos changed the face of the realm forever. Yet Eorzea survived.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00070</h1>\n\n<p>To all intents and purposes, the Meteor project had failed, and the Empire was left to rue its lack of a decisive means to eliminate the primals. Until, that is, it stumbled upon the Ultima Weapon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00080</h1>\n\n<p>Even before the accursed thing was dug up, it seemed to me the XIVth had the might to overwhelm our weakened armies. Yet they chose to hide behind their walls. Why?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00090</h1>\n\n<p>The Black Wolf was wary of making the denizens of Eorzea desperate, lest more primals emerge to bleed the land. The discovery of the Ultima Weapon, however, emboldened him to resume his war of conquest in earnest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00100</h1>\n\n<p>But there was one in Garlemald who believed that van Baelsar's actions were premature\u2500one who stood higher in the imperial army's chain of command. He ordered the legatus to halt his advance, only to find that the Black Wolf had slipped its leash, and that the XIVth now acted alone.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00110</h1>\n\n<p>In a bid to bring van Baelsar to heel, he used the agent he had planted in Ul'dah prior to the Calamity to undermine the legion's efforts.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00120</h1>\n\n<p>A man who outranks van Baelsar, yet opposed the late emperor's decision to annihilate Eorzea... This could only be the former high legatus of the Garlean Army, now known as Emperor Varis zos Galvus.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00130</h1>\n\n<p>So he was Roaille's true master...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00140</h1>\n\n<p>But one of several, in actual fact. We've learned that even as Roaille served the Empire's interests, she sold imperial secrets to a certain faction in Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00150</h1>\n\n<p>In so doing, she helped to maintain the status quo, thus prolonging the conflict. Considering who stands to profit from war, it isn't hard to imagine who her other masters were.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00160</h1>\n\n<p>Seven hells... You mean to say that she was a double agent?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00170</h1>\n\n<p>Triple, if you consider her services to van Baelsar and the new emperor as separate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00180</h1>\n\n<p>As neatly as these pieces seem to fit, one aspect of the puzzle remains unclear to me.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00190</h1>\n\n<p>By whose will was the marshal feeding intelligence to the heretics? And try as I might, I fail to see how aiding their cause would profit either her imperial or Monetarist masters.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00200</h1>\n\n<p>Could it be that another hand is at work here? If so, Roaille must be made to reveal whose it is.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00210</h1>\n\n<p>Not only have I lost a trusted friend; now I must interrogate her as a stranger.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00220</h1>\n\n<p>Not a pleasant task, I grant you, but a necessary one. Unless we weed out the Ivy, root, stalk, and stem, it will simply grow back.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00230</h1>\n\n<p>I know that full well. Those closest to Roaille have already been detained, and I will question them alongside her.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00240</h1>\n\n<p>General. Pray keep in mind that there may be unwitting abettors among them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00250</h1>\n\n<p>All will be treated fairly\u2500on that you have my word. Those who are innocent have no cause to fear.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00260</h1>\n\n<p>You have ever been a friend of truth, General. I hope the unpleasant task of weeding out falsehood will not detain you too long. Though it be for the sake of Eorzea, doubting one's comrades is poison to the soul.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00270</h1>\n\n<p>...And with that, I take my leave.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00280</h1>\n\n<p>All these years, I've been made to dance to their tune...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00290</h1>\n\n<p>How could you, Roaille? How could you side with them...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00300</h1>\n\n<p>...Those cankers who take from this land and give naught in return\u2500who use their power to disempower, and grow fat while the people starve!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00310</h1>\n\n<p>I know you can hear me, Monetarist scum! Your crimes will not go unpunished!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00320</h1>\n\n<p>One day, I will purge this land of your sickness! Before the eyes of the Twelve, I swear it!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00330</h1>\n\n<p>Raaaaaargh!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00010</h1>\n\n<p>I shall have no further need of you this day.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00020</h1>\n\n<p>(-Lady-In-Waiting-)Your Grace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00030</h1>\n\n<p>I fear that not even mine own chambers shall remain private for long.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00040</h1>\n\n<p>Has the situation grown so grim?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00050</h1>\n\n<p>Ever since he proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill, Teledji Adeledji has risen to greater prominence upon the backs of impoverished refugees.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00060</h1>\n\n<p>The Monetarists were ever united in their pursuit of profit, but the man's actions have torn a rift in their ranks.

    "text_clean": "000020 ...Commander Leveilleur bade you serve us? 000030 These are welcome tidings indeed. Given the sensitive nature of the task, I could not rely on one of my own. 000040 That which I am about to tell you, I tell you in the strictest confidence. 000050 Some days ago, we received certain documents from an anonymous source. They notified us of the presence of a Garlean agent within the ranks of one of the Grand Companies. 000060 Following some discreet inquiries, we identified a suspect among the Immortal Flames whom we detained for questioning. 000070 Alas, the man was not our agent. He was but one of many men in the agent's employ. 000080 We pressed the traitor for a name, but he had none to give. He claims never to have met his master, whom he knows only as the Ivy. 000090 He was, however, certain that this  ivy  had coiled itself around every part of the Immortal Flames. It would seem our quarry joined the company some time ago, and gradually recruited others to his cause. 000100 These conspirators are the vines by which he learns our secrets, all without exposing himself. 000110 It won't be easy to identify the Ivy amidst this tangled mass of subterfuge. But we have a tendril in our hands, and we shall follow it all the way to the gnarled root. 000120 Now, much as I would prefer to proceed with due discretion, circumstances demand that this matter be settled posthaste. 000130 Garlemald's war of succession nears its end, and it is feared that the Empire will soon resume its march on Eorzea. 000140 When it does, we can ill afford to have traitors in our midst. The Ivy must be rooted out now. 000150 We must begin by apprising General Raubahn of our findings. I would ask that you accompany me to the Hall of Flames, and remain on hand to see that things go smoothly. 000160 Assuming the Ivy's tendrils are as widespread as we believe, he will be aware that an investigation is underway. And if that is the case, he may well move against us. 000170 We must be prepared for anything, while taking care not to betray our purpose by seeming prepared. A simple enough task for a one-woman army like you. 100010 Well, well. What brings you here, my friend? 100011 She is here at my behest. Greetings, Raubahn. It has been a while. 100020 Ilberd, you old scoundrel! When they told me you'd be visiting, I scarce believed my ears! 100030 But look at you! The honored captain of the Crystal bloody Braves! Who'd have imagined, eh? 100040 Not many. But fewer still would have imagined your destiny lay in politics, old friend. 100050 Aye...we've both come far, have we not? 100060 Lest you wonder, Ilberd and I go back a long way. We've been friends and rivals since we were lads. 100070 The last time we saw each other, Ala Mhigo had just fallen, so you can guess how many summers it's been. And in all that time, not a word from the fool! 100080 Ah, well, my dealings tended toward the modest and mundane...unlike some I could mention. 100090 As I hear it, no sooner did you reach Thanalan than the Brass Blades clapped you in irons and dragged you off to die on the bloodsands. But being a stubborn sort, you won a thousand matches, and earned yourself a place in the people's hearts while you were about it. 100100 Then, with your mountain of prize money, you bought the Coliseum, and secured a seat on the Syndicate. Thal's balls, brother rags-to-riches does not do it justice! You're a hero to the common man! 100110 Bah, spare me. I am no hero. If anyone is worthy of that title, it's our friend here. Next to her, I'm little more than a glorified butcher. 100120 But you, Ilberd you sell yourself short. By all accounts, you were an adventurer of some standing. 100130 I like to think that I did my part for the greater good. But if you are no hero, then I am no adventurer not in this company. Anyway... 100140 I have tidings. 100150 So there has been progress. 100160 I've let it be known that this meeting is a reunion between old friends. None will give your visit a second thought. 100170 To convene elsewhere would only attract attention. Let us speak here, in plain view of all. 100180 ...So it is we who have been compromised. 100190 Teledji Adeledji's machinations have shaken Ul'dah to her foundations. In such uncertain times, a man's loyalty may be bought for a fistful of gil... 100200 But if this snake has truly been in our midst for as long as you say, we must needs consider a far graver possibility: conspiracy. Could it be that the Monetarists have been in league with the Empire from the first? 100210 Very well. I will have my most trusted men investigate the matter. Continue your inquiries in the meantime. 100220 It does me well to see you again, old friend. When next we meet, let it be over a flagon of ale. 100230 I look forward to it. Let us reminisce of bygone days, and drink to the future of our homeland. 100240 Flame General... You wear the mantle well, old friend. I must work hard if I'm to keep up. 100250 Well, it would seem your services were not required after all. I daresay we have Raubahn's prudence to thank for that. Still, I was glad of your presence. My thanks, Scion. 300010 Have faith, my friend. You need only state your case with confidence and clarity. 300020 (-???-)Commander Leveilleur. It is both an honor and a pleasure to meet you. 300030 I am Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights. 300040 Alphinaud Leveilleur, at your service. 300050 Your reputation precedes you, Ser Aymeric. I think we will find that we have much in common. 300060 Speaking of reputations, yours towers over us all. Does it not? 300080 (-Taciturn Temple Knight-)It does indeed, Lord Commander. 300090 I am not too proud to admit that I have followed your activities with an interest bordering on fascination. 300100 Full glad was I to learn that you would be joining us. 300110 Now then, shall we begin? 300120 We know full well that the Garleans will return in force ere long. 300130 What is more, we have yet to achieve a lasting victory over the primal menace. The beast tribes continue to summon their gods, and each incarnation is stronger than the last. 300140 Ishgard is not immune to these threats. I must reiterate that it would behoove your nation to rejoin the Eorzean Alliance. 300150 Once again, I must respectfully disagree. 300160 On what grounds? 300170 Despite their presence in Coerthas, the Ixal do not concern us. Their territorial claims pertain to Gridanian lands, and it is the people of Gridania whom they harry. 300180 Consequently, the Holy See judges this to be a Gridanian affair, and Ishgard does not intervene in the internal affairs of other nations. 300190 Even were that not the case, our forces are wholly committed to the Dravanian conflict. We have not the knights to spare. 300200 As for the Garleans, we are not ignorant of history. We have observed the rise and expansion of the Empire, and we agree that it is only a matter of time before they resume their campaign in Eorzea. 300220 Then surely it would be in our best interests to present a united front? 300230 Mayhap one day, but not yet. 300240 Gaius van Baelsar is dead, and the legion of conscripts he left behind lacks the will to fight. We think it highly unlikely that they will emerge from behind the walls of their castra for some time. 300250 Forgive me, but if Ishgard's position has not changed, why did you agree to this meeting? 300260 It was not only as a representative of Ishgard that I came here. 300270 Pardon? 300280 It is not within my power to change Ishgardian policy, regardless of my personal feelings. There is, however, one area in which I may exert a measure of influence. 300290 Concerns have been raised over the supplies House Fortemps has offered to Revenant's Toll. These have led to calls for restrictions on the provision of aid to foreign powers. 300300 I can ensure that the shipments continue unabated. 300310 Ser Aymeric, we would be in your debt! 300320 No, you would not, for I require something in exchange. 300330 Of late there has been a flurry of Dravanian activity, the purpose of which was not immediately clear. 300340 However, our astrologians have since observed alarming changes in the heavens. The dragon star waxes unnaturally bright, and there are whispers that it portends the resurrection of Midgardsormr. 300350 The fallen guardian of Silvertear Falls? That's absurd. 300360 Full many times have I gazed upon the dragon's corpse, still wound around the Agrius, and wondered how different our world might be if it yet lived to plague the skies. 300370 I do not know, and I do not wish to know. Nor does any son of Ishgard. Yet the mere presence of Dravanian forces is not sufficient grounds to send knights to Mor Dhona, whatever our astrologians say. As I told you before, we have not the forces to spare. 300380 ...But we do. So, you will intervene on our behalf if we agree to watch over the Keeper of the Lake. 300390 Do you accept these terms? 300400 I do. I will see that you are kept abreast of any developments. 300410 I regret that we could not come to a similar agreement on other matters, but I understand that you are not at liberty to make such decisions. 300420 Nevertheless, I hope that what we have accomplished here today will serve to demonstrate to your countrymen that we can work together towards a common goal. Mayhap one day we shall look back on this moment as the first step towards a united Eorzea. 300440 Mayhap we shall, Commander. 300450 What is the meaning of this!? 300460 The caravan, my lord! It's been attacked! 300470 It was Iceheart, my lord! 300480 What!? By the Fury! All our precautions were for naught!? 600010 (-???-)The tales do not do you justice, Warrior of Light. 600020 (-???-)Yes, I know who you are. And you know who I am. 600030 (-Iceheart-)I was given the name Ysayle, but I earned the name Iceheart. 600040 (-Iceheart-)This endless cycle of hatred, of bloodshed, of sorrow  You would see it continue, O noble Warrior of Light? 600050 (-Iceheart-)I would not. I will not. I will bring an end to this war between dragon and man no matter the cost. 600080 (-Iceheart-)In time, you will come to understand that what we do, we do for the greater good. 600090 (-Iceheart-)For Eorzea. For Hydaelyn. 900010 Change has come to the Garlean Empire, and we must discuss the implications. 900011 The rumors are true then? The war of succession is ended? 900020 It is. A new emperor reigns in Garlemald. 900030 Who!? 900040 The birth and all-too-rapid expansion of the Garlean Empire is commonly attributed to the strategic brilliance of Solus zos Galvus, yet he did not rule alone. Several members of the royal household also distinguished themselves during his reign. 900050 Nevertheless, it was the eldest son who stood to inherit the throne until his most untimely passing. 900060 I thought us fortunate when I learned that the Emperor had died without naming a successor. 900070 Would that the Garlean Empire had died with him. 900080 'Twas the grandson and his uncle who had the strongest claims, was it not? 900090 Indeed. Yet claims count for little without the power to assert them. High Legatus Varis yae Galvus is a respected military leader not so, his uncle. 900100 So, young Varis has torn the crown from his uncle's grasp, and taken his place at the head of the Empire. 900120 Given the troubled nature of his succession, the new emperor will require time to seal his grip on power. Yet have no doubt but that he shall, for there are none left with strength enough to oppose him. 900130 Since the success of Operation Archon, the remnants of the XIVth Legion and the forces occupying Ala Mhigo have done naught but fortify their positions. 900140 But you can be sure they'll be ready to march on us again, if their emperor gives the word. 900150 When, not if. They say this Varis was so set upon Eorzean annexation that he spoke out against the Meteor project. 900160 Plainly, the new emperor's intentions are of great concern to us all. 900170 I propose that we set aside the Carteneau dispute for the present and discuss what measures the Alliance might take to prepare for a resumption of hostilities with Garlemald. 900171 Moreover, I move that we reexamine the question of how our former allies in Ishgard might be persuaded to retake their place at our side. Could Eorzea but stand as one, 'twould deal a grave blow to our enemy's ambitions. 900180 Well, I suppose we should be grateful that they have finally acknowledged the inevitability of imperial attack. Who knows, they may even do something about it. 900190 If only the leaders of Ishgard would follow their example, and stop hiding behind their gates, praying for the coming storm to pass them by. 900200 But that is a discussion for another time. At present, I am more concerned by the fact that the Alliance's mooted preparations will be made known to the Garleans many moons before their coming. 900210 So long as the Ivy eludes our grasp, no secret is safe. B00010 (-???-)Minfilia, am I right? B00020 None other. I bid you welcome to Revenant's Toll, and thank you for traveling so far on such short notice. B00030 (-???-)Hah! As if I could ever say no to Urianger! B00040 Moenbryda is an accomplished Sharlayan scholar and an authority on aetheryte technologies. B00050 She has played an invaluable role in our search for a means to capture Ascian souls. B00060 Charmed, I'm sure. C00010 Everyone, if I could have your attention! C00011 We have with us an esteemed guest who is come from Sharlayan to assist us. C00020 Moen! Gods, it's been ages! C00030 Oh, longer, sister! C00040 A joyous reunion indeed. C00050 Well, of course it is! Moen and I are like twin sisters! C00060 ...Save in appearance and aptitude. C00070 Everyone, please! C00080 I bid Moenbryda join us here that she might share with us her extensive knowledge of aetherytes. C00090 Also, as many of you are already aware, she has been overseeing our research into white auracite a sample of which she has been good enough to bring with her. C00110 Well, I had to come, didn't I? You'd have to be bloody daft to turn your nose up at a chance like this. Where better to conduct my final tests than a land so steeped in aether you can taste it!? C00120 'Tis plain the passage of the years hath done little to dampen thy youthful spirits... C00130 ...And nothing at all to reform thy youthful manner. C00140 Urianger! Where in the hells've you been hiding? C00150 Un...unhand me. C00160 I come all this way, and that's what you have to say to me!? C00170 I much preferred when you were pleading with me to drop everything and hurry to your side. What was it you said?  None save thee can satisfy this need  C00180 Go on... C00190 Th-Thine artless attempts to misrepresent mine all-too-innocent motives do thee little credit! C00200 Mine intent, as well thou knowest, was but to impress upon thee the gravity of the circumstance. Lest thou doubt, a deiform entity shall shortly be summoned, save if thou, and no other, grantest my compeers thine aid. C00210 You still haven't found it, then? Your missing aetheryte? C00220 We have not, no. C00230 We know that Iceheart teleported to an aetheryte not far from the first, yet even after careful analysis, we could not locate the second beacon. C00240 We now suspect that the heretics destroyed the second aetheryte to impede our pursuit. C00250 Our allies continue to scour Snowcloak for Iceheart's sanctuary, but we have no guarantee that they will find it. Yet it must be found, for even now Iceheart prepares to call upon Saint Shiva. C00260 I'm sorry but...if the aetheryte's been destroyed, then that's that. C00270 Although... You're absolutely sure she used the first aetheryte, are you? She didn't just use teleportation magicks? C00280 One of our own bore witness to her escape. I can say with absolute certainty that Iceheart used the aetheryte. C00290 In that case, there might be a way so long as the aetherial current is still flowing. C00300 Truly? How? C00310 We use the current to recreate the beacon. C00320 As you know, aetherytes are a bit like lighthouses. We use them to reconstitute our physical forms when crossing the aetherial sea. Without them, we'd lose all sense of direction and our essence would dissipate. C00350 However, we don't rely solely on these beacons. There are currents of aether which flow between them currents which help guide us to our destination. C00360 Now, these currents will gradually dwindle away to nothing if an aetheryte is destroyed. But if even a sluggish flow remains, we could theoretically use it to direct a surge of concentrated aether towards the void left by the beacon and thereby fill it up again. C00380 Like opening the floodgates to fill a dry riverbed. Though, correct me if I'm wrong, but would we not need a veritable reservoir of aether? C00390 In concert, we might manage to channel a sufficient volume, yet that is not my chief concern. C00400 To direct the flow of so great a volume of aether with the requisite precision would be a nigh-impossible task in itself. C00410 I barely succeeded in facilitating travel to an unattuned beacon. That which you describe sounds considerably more difficult. C00420 And dangerous! Every person who has attempted to teleport in this fashion has died in the process. They, however, did not have white auracite at their disposal! C00440 I can use it to channel all the aether you can give me into the aetheryte. However, white auracite cannot retain aether for an extended period of time, so we would need to infuse it immediately beforehand. C00450 Just so you know, I'd confidently give this plan better than even odds of success. And if the worst comes to the worst, your people won't suffer. C00490 Though it risk the lives of our best and brightest, we have not the time to seek other options. C00500 If the aetherial current still flows, we shall carry out Moenbryda's plan. C00510 That's the spirit! Let's roll the dice! D00010 You should never have come here, Warrior of Light. I labor only to forge a lasting peace. D00020 A peace you would deny us out of ignorance and blind faith. D00030 No matter. If it is our fate to be at odds, then it is mine to strike you down. D00040 We whom gods and men have forsaken shall be the instruments of our own deliverance! D00050 Partake of my flesh fill this vessel with your light! Walk amongst your brothers and sisters once more! D00060 O Saint Shiva, still the hatred within our hearts and bless us with eternal grace! D00070 Hmph... E00010 (-Iceheart-)Fool... Blind, bloody fool. E00020 (-Iceheart-)You of all people should understand the suffering war begets that no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the violence. E00021 (-Iceheart-)Mine is the righteous cause! E00030 (-Iceheart-)You fight in a war you do not understand a pawn of liars and schemers. E00040 (-Iceheart-)And they are no less ignorant than you! Following the creed of their fathers without question, never thinking to ask why. E00050 (-Iceheart-)Trapped in a delusion of their own creation and blind to the truth. E00060 (-Iceheart-)Warrior of Light, redemption is not beyond us. E00070 (-Iceheart-)We who walk before may lead those who walk after. E00080 (-Iceheart-)Seek the Keeper of the Lake. See with eyes unclouded. E00090 (-Iceheart-)Do...do not squander Mother's gift. E00100 (-Iceheart-)Hear... Feel... Think... E00110 (-???-)And so the vessel withdraws. A predictable outcome. E00120 (-???-)Nevertheless, Lahabrea will be pleased. E00130 (-???-)How unfortunate. F00010 On behalf of the Holy See of Ishgard, allow me to express my deepest thanks. F00020 Never before have we been required to contend with a primal. Indeed, there were fears in some quarters that our knights might not be equal to the task. F00030 From what we have now learned of these beings, I can say with certainty that we would have lost a great many men had the Scions not intervened. F00040 Then the argument for preemptive action should be self-evident. Perchance now you will reconsider my proposal that Ishgard move against Natalan? F00050 Ere we first met, a similar proposal was tabled but the Holy See decreed that we were to observe, and that military action should be taken only in self-defense. F00060 All things considered, it was not an unreasonable decision. Since the Calamity, two vigils have fallen to the Horde, while Garuda has never shown any inclination to storm the Gates of Judgement. F00070 ...Which is why this unprecedented crisis and its resolution may prompt a change in policy. F00080 You who have faced these primals know well the threat they pose. Ishgard did not not until now. F00090 And there is naught like a brush with death to change a man's outlook. F00110 At the very least, this should silence any lingering objections to our arrangement with Revenant's Toll. F00120 The Holy See may even feel moved to grant us its formal endorsement. F00130 So far as it is possible, the Scions shall be compensated for their service. F00140 We should be grateful for any aid you can provide. F00150 As a gesture of good faith, I shall withdraw my previous request. Your people are doubtless needed elsewhere. F00160 That will not be necessary. F00170 We too have a vested interest in watching Dravania's movements. F00171 I see. Once more, I must thank you. F00172 Ser Aymeric, if I may... Do you truly believe that Midgardsormr could return? F00180 The heavens are a window unto truth, but those who interpret their movements are not infallible. I requested your involvement as a precautionary measure. F00190 But of course... You sought an excuse to compensate us from the first, mindful of what would happen if Revenant's Toll were taken by your enemies. F00200 Ishgard is not wont to aid its neighbors, but that does not preclude it from manipulating them to serve its own interests. F00210 (-Taciturn Temple Knight-)Choose your next words carefully. F00220 Do you know what sort of man becomes lord commander of the Temple Knights? F00230 One who comes from good stock. I did not, yet here I am. Now why do you suppose that is? F00240 Because I swiftly learned to tell the difference between words, deeds, and beliefs. F00250 ...You are correct, Master Leveilleur. Ishgard desires to see Revenant's Toll flourish, as it would present a troublesome obstacle to our enemies from the south. F00260 We are so glad to be of use to you. F00270 As we are to you. Ours is a mutually beneficial arrangement, lest we forget. One born of necessity. F00280 The dragons grow more restless by the day, and the heretics harry us nigh without cease. F00290 We have contended with such troubles for centuries, but there are limits to even our endurance. F00300 Yet as a pauper is loath to part with his meager possessions, the leaders of Ishgard are not wont to render up their trust to outsiders. F00310 But with perseverance on our part, they may yet be made to see the light. F00320 Nevertheless, one must take care when walking the road less traveled. F00330 Wise words, Ser Aymeric. I shall make a point to remember them. F00340 I must apologize for my earlier outburst. I hope it will not sour our good relations. F00350 Not at all. You but spoke from the heart. F00360 I trust you understand that, at times, my duties may prevent me from meeting with you. F00370 On such occasions, my second-in-command will speak for me. F00380 (-Lucia-)Lucia, at your service. F00390 (-Lucia-)Pray excuse our reticence. We are but wary of speaking too freely, lest our sentiments be made known to our enemies. F00400 (-Lucia-)Know that the lord commander and I are of one mind. For the sake of Ishgard and of Eorzea at large I pray our peoples can put aside their differences. F00410 (-Lucia-)Those who dwell in the past risk losing sight of their future. F00420 Should aught befall one of our shipments, pray inform Lucia immediately. You may also relay to her any words you might have for me alone. F00430 Not being of Ishgardian birth, she owes no allegiance to any noble house, making her as near to incorruptible as one can find in my homeland. Suffice it to say, I trust her completely, and so may you. F00440 Which reminds me  Lord Haurchefant, if you would be so kind. F00450 Certainly. F00460 In times such as these, trust is ever in short supply. Mayhap this will go some way to rectify the problem. F00470 The results of our investigation into the heretics' recent attacks, as well as our interrogation of the merchant you detained. F00480 Ser Aymeric... I cannot thank you enough. F00490 Think nothing of it. Ishgard may be many things, but it is no friend to Garlemald. F00500 Did I not tell you to have faith, my friend? G00010 Words cannot well express how glad I am to see you returned to us hale and whole. G00011 Needless to say, I am most eager to hear your account of that which occurred in Coerthas assuming you are ready to speak of it? G00020 Excellent. I shall summon the others at once. G00030 Iceheart used her own body as a vessel for a primal's soul? G00040 Master Louisoix's writings make no mention of such a possibility. Can we be certain this entity was a primal? G00050 As certain as we can be that Good King Moggle Mog XII was a primal, I should think. Both were ostensibly summoned. G00060 Let's not quibble over definitions. Of more concern is the implication that Iceheart retained her will even after she was possessed. We are talking about a mortal wielding the power of a primal! G00070 It can't possibly be that easy, can it? There must be some sort of sacrifice required. Or maybe she's just special? G00080 What qualities this woman possesseth, I know not, but full sure am I that she was groomed for this role. G00090 Few are privy to the secrets of summoning, and but a single party standeth to profit from their dissemination. G00100 Well, I wouldn't presume to comment on how the lass came to know about summoning, but I will say that what she summoned was a primal. The readings were the same, or near as damn it. G00110 Strange as it all sounds, it's really no different from what you've faced before. G00120 Then mayhap it is time that we reexamined our previous encounters. G00130 Pack your things, Yda. We're going back to Gridania. G00140 Yes sir! G00150 About Iceheart's final words to you... G00200 \"Hear... Feel... Think...  G00210 Hydaelyn speaks to her as well. G00211 If Iceheart is blessed with the power of the Echo, she will doubtless have used it to further her goals. G00212 ...Or could it be that it was a revelation granted her by the Echo which first set her on this path? She did say that the Ishgardians were blind to the truth. G00213 Do you think she has knowledge of the origins of the Ishgardian-Dravanian war? It would do much to explain her unwavering conviction. G00220 Did not the Lady Iceheart implore thee to seek the Keeper of the Lake? And did she not imply that in so doing thou wouldst come to see with eyes unclouded? G00230 Midgardsormr was a king amongst kings who reigned for centuries on end... But he is dead, and his wisdom lost to the ages unless the Ishgardians' fears are well founded... G00240 It would seem we have yet another reason to stand watch over the Keeper of the Lake. For a mercy, we are well positioned to do so. G00280 Iceheart, Shiva, Ascians, and Midgardsormr. I shudder to think how they are all connected... H00010 I have heard. Truly bothersome business. H00020 No, I do not foresee a problem on that front. The main concern is Raubahn there is no telling what the brute might do. H00030 Have the Blades watch him and the Flames day and night. H00040 You may leave the sultana to me. I shall personally attend Her Grace. H00050 <sigh> H00060 Sever one of the East Aldenard trade routes. That ought to keep Lolorito occupied for a while. H00070 Nanamo Ul Namo... For my sake, pray be a good little sultana to the last. I00010 Welcome back, my friend. I have already received word from Alphinaud. I00011 To think that Flame Marshal Roaille was the Garlean agent... I know not what to say. I00020 Together with Raubahn, Eline lent us much-needed aid at the time of our order's founding. She was particularly passionate about the need to tackle the primal threat. I00030 When we discussed the subject, her eyes fairly shone with determination. Whatever else she may have been, I choose to believe that it was her true self with whom I spoke then... I00040 But now is not the time to dwell on such matters. I00050 I have an important announcement to make regarding our effort to defeat the Ascians. We shall begin as soon as everyone is assembled. I00060 My thanks for coming, friends. Moenbryda, the floor is yours. I00070 By now, I'm sure you're all familiar with white auracite, the miraculous material that'll allow us to capture Ascian souls. I00080 Back at Snowcloak, we verified its ability to absorb vast amounts of aether. I00090 Alas, it leaves something to be desired in the area of stability. The stone can only store aether for a short while before expelling its contents. I00100 In addition to auracite's inherent limitations, we must needs be wary of our enemy's strength. I00110 Our foe draweth upon an infinite wellspring of power. Even should we succeed in entrapping him, the stone will not long contain his wrath. I00120 Meaning that if we want to kill the swine, we'll have to be quick about it. I00130 'Tis our belief that an Ascian soul may be permanently undone if smitten by a sufficiently concentrated burst of pure aether. I00140 The only trouble is, we can't say for sure how concentrated the burst needs to be... Without knowing how much aether an Ascian soul is composed of, we're basically guessing. I00150 Our sole clue lieth in thy struggle with Lahabrea. I00160 During that encounter, Hydaelyn bid you forge what She called  a blade of Light,  a weapon which took the form of a luminous stream of energy. I00170 Based on your description, we believe the  blade  with which you vanquished your foe was composed of aether. I00180 Admittedly, your victory proved ephemeral, as Lahabrea was able to use a Crystal of Darkness to flee into the space that lies between our world and the void. I00190 The fact remains, however, that Hydaelyn placed the means to destroy the Ascians in your hands. I00200 Be that as it may, it would be unwise to assume that She will do the same when next we encounter such a foe. I00210 Quite so, my lady. We must needs find the means to forge our own blade of aether one to equal that which Hydaelyn did benevolently bestow upon Her champion. I00220 That is all well and good, but it seems to me that producing such a blade will require a prodigious quantity of aether. Whence will it come, pray tell? I00230 Ummm... Oh! What if we had two pieces of white auracite? One to trap the Ascian, and the other to store the aether for the blade! I00240 Nice try, but it's as I said: the stone won't hold aether for any length of time. We'd still need to collect the stuff there and then, sorry to say. I00250 And therein lies the rub: finding a way to create the blade whenever and wherever we choose. I00260 'Twould seem more research is in order. I00270 I'm going to linger awhile perform a few more tests on the auracite. I00280 And I could do with some help. Urianger, why don't you lend me a hand? I00290 M-Mine apologies, but I am required at the Waking Sands. I00300 Lady Minfilia hath given me sole charge of the premises. 'Twould be unseemly to leave them unattended. I00310 \"Sole charge,  you say? So...you're basically alone there, then? Well, that settles it! I'll just have to come to you! I00320 While you were afield, word arrived from the Sharlayan motherland. I00330 You will recall that a survey party was dispatched to investigate the incident at the Isle of Val. What they discovered was troubling to say the least. I00340 According to the report, the isle has been erased from existence. 'Twas as if a hole had been torn in the very fabric of reality. I00350 Aye...yet the mystery endeth not with the isle's disappearance. I00360 It hath come to light that a number of scholars in various other locales were reported missing at a similar juncture. I00370 What's more, they all had something in common with the head of the Students of Baldesion. Every last one of them was researching a phenomenon called dimensional compression or the  Rejoining,  as the ancient texts call it. I'll be damned if that's a coincidence. I00380 All indications suggest Ascian involvement, but I sense that a force greater still is at work the entity the dark beings call  the one true god ... I00390 We must pray that my dear friend Krile regains consciousness soon. If she bore witness to the Isle of Val's final moments, she may be able to shed some light on this mystery... J00010 Following the Calamity, the forces of the XIVth Imperial Legion entrenched themselves in strategic locations across Eorzea. J00020 So swiftly did they accomplish this, it was suspected that they had received help. To think that it came from Roaille... My right hand. J00030 There is more. We have reason to believe that Roaille didn't deal exclusively with the XIVth. She also answered to a higher authority in Garlemald. J00040 But this higher authority could not have been the Emperor. By consenting to the Meteor project, Solus zos Galvus showed himself to be more concerned about preventing the spread of primal influence than claiming Eorzea for the Empire. He would happily have seen the lot reduced to ash. J00050 We believe a number of high-ranking figures within the royal household were against the decision, but that they knew better than to oppose the Emperor openly. Of course, this didn't prevent them from making clandestine provisions, in which Roaille played a part. J00060 Alas, these provisions did not prevent Dalamud from falling, and the ensuing chaos changed the face of the realm forever. Yet Eorzea survived. J00070 To all intents and purposes, the Meteor project had failed, and the Empire was left to rue its lack of a decisive means to eliminate the primals. Until, that is, it stumbled upon the Ultima Weapon. J00080 Even before the accursed thing was dug up, it seemed to me the XIVth had the might to overwhelm our weakened armies. Yet they chose to hide behind their walls. Why? J00090 The Black Wolf was wary of making the denizens of Eorzea desperate, lest more primals emerge to bleed the land. The discovery of the Ultima Weapon, however, emboldened him to resume his war of conquest in earnest. J00100 But there was one in Garlemald who believed that van Baelsar's actions were premature one who stood higher in the imperial army's chain of command. He ordered the legatus to halt his advance, only to find that the Black Wolf had slipped its leash, and that the XIVth now acted alone. J00110 In a bid to bring van Baelsar to heel, he used the agent he had planted in Ul'dah prior to the Calamity to undermine the legion's efforts. J00120 A man who outranks van Baelsar, yet opposed the late emperor's decision to annihilate Eorzea... This could only be the former high legatus of the Garlean Army, now known as Emperor Varis zos Galvus. J00130 So he was Roaille's true master... J00140 But one of several, in actual fact. We've learned that even as Roaille served the Empire's interests, she sold imperial secrets to a certain faction in Eorzea. J00150 In so doing, she helped to maintain the status quo, thus prolonging the conflict. Considering who stands to profit from war, it isn't hard to imagine who her other masters were. J00160 Seven hells... You mean to say that she was a double agent? J00170 Triple, if you consider her services to van Baelsar and the new emperor as separate. J00180 As neatly as these pieces seem to fit, one aspect of the puzzle remains unclear to me. J00190 By whose will was the marshal feeding intelligence to the heretics? And try as I might, I fail to see how aiding their cause would profit either her imperial or Monetarist masters. J00200 Could it be that another hand is at work here? If so, Roaille must be made to reveal whose it is. J00210 Not only have I lost a trusted friend; now I must interrogate her as a stranger. J00220 Not a pleasant task, I grant you, but a necessary one. Unless we weed out the Ivy, root, stalk, and stem, it will simply grow back. J00230 I know that full well. Those closest to Roaille have already been detained, and I will question them alongside her. J00240 General. Pray keep in mind that there may be unwitting abettors among them. J00250 All will be treated fairly on that you have my word. Those who are innocent have no cause to fear. J00260 You have ever been a friend of truth, General. I hope the unpleasant task of weeding out falsehood will not detain you too long. Though it be for the sake of Eorzea, doubting one's comrades is poison to the soul. J00270 ...And with that, I take my leave. J00280 All these years, I've been made to dance to their tune... J00290 How could you, Roaille? How could you side with them...? J00300 ...Those cankers who take from this land and give naught in return who use their power to disempower, and grow fat while the people starve! J00310 I know you can hear me, Monetarist scum! Your crimes will not go unpunished! J00320 One day, I will purge this land of your sickness! Before the eyes of the Twelve, I swear it! J00330 Raaaaaargh! K00010 I shall have no further need of you this day. K00020 (-Lady-In-Waiting-)Your Grace. K00030 I fear that not even mine own chambers shall remain private for long. K00040 Has the situation grown so grim? K00050 Ever since he proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill, Teledji Adeledji has risen to greater prominence upon the backs of impoverished refugees. K00060 The Monetarists were ever united in their pursuit of profit, but the man's actions have torn a rift in their ranks. They snap at each other as rabid dogs. K00070 Yet now is not the time to be bickering among ourselves. K00080 If this bickering is a threat to law and order, might you not have grounds to dissolve the Syndicate? K00090 Would that the solution were so simple, Admiral. Alas, my moving to dissolve the Syndicate is certain to spark outrage among the influential merchant class, whom the cabal represents. K00100 This would serve to exacerbate the current unrest, and peace would slip still further away. K00110 Be they rich or poor, natives or refugees, all who reside in Ul'dah have a right to pursue happiness. It is the duty of a ruler to protect this right. K00120 If I am to perform my duty, I must needs tread warily. It would not do to make enemies heedlessly. K00130 Were Lord Lolorito here, he would doubtless say that I have my head in the clouds. K00140 A ruler is required to take a wide view. Try as we might to cater to all needs, some will inevitably be overlooked. As such, there shall ever be citizens who feel aggrieved. It cannot be helped. K00150 But as you have informed us, the Monetarists take no view but their own. They hunger for power while the masses starve. K00160 In the absence of a common cause, it seems beyond any one individual to make Ul'dah whole. K00170 And the presence of a Garlean agent within the Immortal Flames only makes matters worse. K00180 Even accounting for Ul'dah's historic reliance upon mercenaries, such a grievous breach of security is unprecedented. I fear this business will provide the Monetarists with a rod to beat Raubahn. K00190 Eorzea can ill afford for the Immortal Flames to be dampened now. Ere long, the Garleans will turn their ravenous gaze toward our lands once more. If we are to resist their might, our nations must stand together. K00200 Yet for this to happen, our nations must be whole. Can naught be done to improve the situation in Ul'dah? K00210 The true wealth of Ul'dah lies in the health, happiness, and hopes of her citizens. Alas, the citizens shall never know these things so long as their lives are ruled by the ambitions of the few. K00220 The Monetarists claim to represent the best interests of the people, but in sooth they desire only to manipulate them for their own selfish ends. K00230 For the government to serve the people, it must be formed of the people. K00240 For Ul'dah to move forward, it is not only the Syndicate that must be dissolved. K00250 Nay... You jest... K00260 My friends it was for no other reason than to make known to you mine intent that I requested your presence here. K00270 When I make my declaration to the people, chaos shall inevitably ensue. K00280 As the last monarch in the line of Ul, I make unto you this request. K00290 Help Raubahn to preserve order, and protect the people. Forsake them, and you forsake yourselves, for a strong Eorzea will ever have need of a strong Ul'dah. K00300 Your Grace... Are you certain of this? K00310 There is no other way. K00320 When the time is ripe, the nation shall become a true republic. Both Royalists and Monetarists shall cease to be. K00330 Ul'dah will no longer belong to kings or queens or merchant princes, but to her people. K00340 Raubahn... Forgive me for casting aside all that you have toiled for in my name... K00350 Beyond this gesture, I am powerless to help my subjects.",

Without your valor, I might never have broken free of Bahamut's control.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400050</h1>\n\n<p>These last few moments are mine to live as the man I once was.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>This is all that I wanted. Yet now that it is happening, I find myself struggling to believe it... Is it really you?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400070</h1>\n\n<p>Grandfather, pray forgive me my insolence. It was not my intent to demean you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400080</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive you? I am proud of you, child. You were wise enough to deduce the manner of creature I had become.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400090</h1>\n\n<p>Alphinaud. Alisaie. If any here should beg forgiveness, it is I.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400100</h1>\n\n<p>Grandfather, I must ask... Will you not tell us what befell during the Calamity?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400110</h1>\n\n<p>Yes. Yes, of course. You have come far to hear the truth...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400120</h1>\n\n<p>Let us then begin the tale at the Battle of Carteneau, where clashed the forces of the Garlean Empire and the Eorzean Alliance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400130</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas there in the sky above the surging armies that the elder primal Bahamut broke free of the red moon, Dalamud.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400140</h1>\n\n<p>In an effort to contain this avatar of destruction, I called upon the Twelve to aid me in the creation of a prison of aether...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400150</h1>\n\n<p>But Bahamut would not be caged by such feeble bars\u2500too vast was his might; too fierce his rage.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400170</h1>\n\n<p>You know of what happened next. I used the last of my strength to send you and your companions outside of time, and then prepared to meet my end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400180</h1>\n\n<p>Little choice remained to me. I used the last of my strength to entrust our hope unto the future, and prepared to meet my end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500010</h1>\n\n<p>As you have no doubt surmised, I did not perish. When the cage built from the essences of the Twelve was destroyed, the sky was filled with a colossal cloud of aether...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500020</h1>\n\n<p>This drifting energy responded to the prayers of those fighting below\u2500and to my own desperate wish that the dying realm be saved\u2500by infusing me with the power of a primal.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500030</h1>\n\n<p>I became the immortal Phoenix, ancient symbol of rebirth.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500040</h1>\n\n<p>Rising into the sky, I struck Bahamut with all my newfound strength. The blow shattered his earthly form, and a shower of aether rained down upon the land.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500050</h1>\n\n<p>Thus began the rejuvenation of Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500060</h1>\n\n<p>Believing the deed done, I relinquished my hold on that staggering energy, desirous that it should be returned to the realm without delay.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500070</h1>\n\n<p>But I had not reckoned on Bahamut's tenacious will. Even as he teetered upon the cusp of oblivion, the dragon reached out to claim me.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500080</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, within my fast fading form, enough remained of the Phoenix's energy to offer Bahamut a hold, and he dragged me along in his wake.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500090</h1>\n\n<p>And thus began your existence as the elder primal's thrall...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500100</h1>\n\n<p>I cannot help but wonder at his will to survive... Though he was all but obliterated, Bahamut found a way to seize the power you surrendered.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500110</h1>\n\n<p>That would explain why part of his physical form survived to be entombed underground.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500120</h1>\n\n<p>'Twould also explain why Eorzea was so terribly warped. Even as the land sought to restore itself, the returning flow of aether was cut off.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500130</h1>\n\n<p>Very good. When his grip on existence was once again secured, Bahamut did not cease his feast until he had consumed every last mote of aether that yet floated in the air.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500140</h1>\n\n<p>And still he was not fully restored...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500150</h1>\n\n<p>You must remember that by this time, much of the freed aether had already returned to the land. That which remained was not sufficient to reconstruct so massive a form in its entirety.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500160</h1>\n\n<p>But there did not need to be\u2500not for a being sustained by the marvels of Allagan technology.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500170</h1>\n\n<p>As long as some piece of Bahamut persists, the coils will seek it out and continue their regenerative task.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500180</h1>\n\n<p>The fragments of Dalamud appear motionless from the surface, but deep beneath the ground they had been searching...tunneling through rock and soil towards their escaped prisoner.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500190</h1>\n\n<p>And, as you have observed for yourselves, they found his heart.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500200</h1>\n\n<p>Warrior of Light, heed me. You must put a stop to Bahamut's regeneration.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500210</h1>\n\n<p>Whether it be for man or for dragonkind, the question of justice is irrelevant. The elder primal will leave naught but a smoldering wasteland for both his children and ours.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500220</h1>\n\n<p>I beg you to defend Eorzea\u2500as you always have, and as I always knew you would.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500230</h1>\n\n<p>I beg you to defend Eorzea, and guide its people to the future they yet struggle to find.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500240</h1>\n\n<p>This portal will take you to the final internment hulk. 'Tis time for the tale of Bahamut and his part in the Calamity to come to an end!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500250</h1>\n\n<p>Alphinaud, Alisaie. Pray come closer.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500260</h1>\n\n<p>Your hopes and dreams must no longer be an extension of mine. You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm\u2500your own meaning in this sea of chaos.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500270</h1>\n\n<p>Will you do that for me?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500280</h1>\n\n<p>Of course, Grandfather. I have already made it my mission to see this newborn Eorzea survive and flourish.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500290</h1>\n\n<p>Alisaie. While I was yet in thrall to Bahamut, you spoke of my faith in man's strength. Know that your words reached me, imprisoned though my soul still was.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500300</h1>\n\n<p>So forceful was your conviction, I wonder if that belief has not become your own. Perhaps, after all your anger and sorrow was spent, you found something greater within you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500310</h1>\n\n<p>See this fight to its culmination. 'Tis also your strength in which I have faith.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500320</h1>\n\n<p>Thank you...for everything... Pray take your rest, Grandfather... You deserve it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500330</h1>\n\n<p>There are records of an art that allowed one to summon the power of a primal from the essence of its demise.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500340</h1>\n\n<p>And though I am no true primal, all that I have left, I give to you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500350</h1>\n\n<p>Alphinaud. Alisaie. My darling grandchildren. May Light's blessings ever keep and protect you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500360</h1>\n\n<p>Come, Warrior of Light. Our task remains undone!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600010</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas a long and arduous road, but at last we reach its end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600020</h1>\n\n<p>Farewell, Bahamut. I banish you back to the aether!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600030</h1>\n\n<p>He is not yet whole! I did not think him capable...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600040</h1>\n\n<p>Ah!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600050</h1>\n\n<p>Ugh!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600060</h1>\n\n<p>Ugh... Alisaie! ALISAIE!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600070</h1>\n\n<p>I had thought it finally over...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600080</h1>\n\n<p>We'll not survive another blast!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600090</h1>\n\n<p>No... Is this how I honor my promise to Grandfather?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600100</h1>\n\n<p>You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm\u2500your own meaning in this sea of chaos. Will you do that for me?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600110</h1>\n\n<p>I will, Grandfather. In fact, I believe I already have.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600120</h1>\n\n<p>That reason has been with me all along, guiding me\u2500Eorzea's blade of Light, shearing through the endless shrouds of darkness...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600130</h1>\n\n<p>I have been shown the miraculous feats of which we are all capable. Of which I am capable.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600140</h1>\n\n<p>Bahamut! You have wreaked enough havoc!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600150</h1>\n\n<p>I will not let your wrathful fires consume all that we know and love!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600160</h1>\n\n<p>Ugh!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600170</h1>\n\n<p>How long I have waited to hear you say that! You have found your resolve at last!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600180</h1>\n\n<p>Let me join my strength to yours.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600190</h1>\n\n<p>In this place, in this moment, our purpose has become one!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600191</h1>\n\n<p>(-Alphinaud and Alisaie-)For the future of Eorzea!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600200</h1>\n\n<p>This last task is yours, Warrior of Light! You must destroy Bahamut's crystal core!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700010</h1>\n\n<p>You did it!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700020</h1>\n\n<p>But one task remains...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700030</h1>\n\n<p>With this last coil disabled, there shall be naught left to bind Bahamut to this world. His beloved children will finally know peace...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700040</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis done. He is truly gone.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700050</h1>\n\n<p>You knew, didn't you? You knew what Grandfather had become.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700060</h1>\n\n<p>I...was not certain. But from all I had gleaned, it seemed a distinct possibility.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700070</h1>\n\n<p>The scene people describe of the Battle of Carteneau was one of unimaginable devastation. And 'tis through the combined prayers of the desperate\u2500and an abundant source of aether\u2500that primals are born. I merely put two and two together.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700080</h1>\n\n<p>And you consider that a sufficient explanation?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700090</h1>\n\n<p>Well, however you stumbled across your theory, 'twas this revelation that made you wary of my attachment to Grandfather.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700100</h1>\n\n<p>You feared that in my obsession, I would fall under his primal sway. Is that why you decided to join us? To pull me back should I show signs of wavering?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700110</h1>\n\n<p>Pray forgive me, Sister. I wished only to protect you. Yet I see now that I needn't have doubted the strength of your conviction.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700120</h1>\n\n<p>May I ask you a question? What do you now intend to do with the truth you have uncovered?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700130</h1>\n\n<p>Which particular truth was that, Brother? The fact that desperate prayer gave rise to the primal Phoenix? That this new god was responsible for setting Eorzea on the path to rebirth?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700140</h1>\n\n<p>Should such a tale become common knowledge, people would soon offer up their prayers in earnest\u2500they would beseech Phoenix to complete the healing that was begun.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700150</h1>\n\n<p>Yet as you and I know all too well, the very act of calling forth this savior would do more harm to the land than good.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700160</h1>\n\n<p>We cannot encourage such worship for this very reason. Were Grandfather forced to return as an aether-draining primal, 'twould undo all that he had worked to protect.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700170</h1>\n\n<p>Your abiding love for him was the key that unlocked the truth of the Calamity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700180</h1>\n\n<p>But keys may also serve to seal doors that were best left unopened.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700190</h1>\n\n<p>Let your love now guide your actions, and lock away deep inside the fate of both Grandfather and Bahamut.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700200</h1>\n\n<p>Fear not, Alphinaud\u2500I understand what must be done.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700210</h1>\n\n<p>The realm need not know the truth for it to be saved.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700220</h1>\n\n<p>That the elder primal is banished, to return no more...that is enough.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700230</h1>\n\n<p>Let us make our way back to the surface.

Will you not tell us what befell during the Calamity? 400110 Yes. Yes, of course. You have come far to hear the truth... 400120 Let us then begin the tale at the Battle of Carteneau, where clashed the forces of the Garlean Empire and the Eorzean Alliance. 400130 'Twas there in the sky above the surging armies that the elder primal Bahamut broke free of the red moon, Dalamud. 400140 In an effort to contain this avatar of destruction, I called upon the Twelve to aid me in the creation of a prison of aether... 400150 But Bahamut would not be caged by such feeble bars too vast was his might; too fierce his rage. 400170 You know of what happened next. I used the last of my strength to send you and your companions outside of time, and then prepared to meet my end. 400180 Little choice remained to me. I used the last of my strength to entrust our hope unto the future, and prepared to meet my end. 500010 As you have no doubt surmised, I did not perish. When the cage built from the essences of the Twelve was destroyed, the sky was filled with a colossal cloud of aether... 500020 This drifting energy responded to the prayers of those fighting below and to my own desperate wish that the dying realm be saved by infusing me with the power of a primal. 500030 I became the immortal Phoenix, ancient symbol of rebirth. 500040 Rising into the sky, I struck Bahamut with all my newfound strength. The blow shattered his earthly form, and a shower of aether rained down upon the land. 500050 Thus began the rejuvenation of Eorzea. 500060 Believing the deed done, I relinquished my hold on that staggering energy, desirous that it should be returned to the realm without delay. 500070 But I had not reckoned on Bahamut's tenacious will. Even as he teetered upon the cusp of oblivion, the dragon reached out to claim me. 500080 Alas, within my fast fading form, enough remained of the Phoenix's energy to offer Bahamut a hold, and he dragged me along in his wake. 500090 And thus began your existence as the elder primal's thrall... 500100 I cannot help but wonder at his will to survive... Though he was all but obliterated, Bahamut found a way to seize the power you surrendered. 500110 That would explain why part of his physical form survived to be entombed underground. 500120 'Twould also explain why Eorzea was so terribly warped. Even as the land sought to restore itself, the returning flow of aether was cut off. 500130 Very good. When his grip on existence was once again secured, Bahamut did not cease his feast until he had consumed every last mote of aether that yet floated in the air. 500140 And still he was not fully restored... 500150 You must remember that by this time, much of the freed aether had already returned to the land. That which remained was not sufficient to reconstruct so massive a form in its entirety. 500160 But there did not need to be not for a being sustained by the marvels of Allagan technology. 500170 As long as some piece of Bahamut persists, the coils will seek it out and continue their regenerative task. 500180 The fragments of Dalamud appear motionless from the surface, but deep beneath the ground they had been searching...tunneling through rock and soil towards their escaped prisoner. 500190 And, as you have observed for yourselves, they found his heart. 500200 Warrior of Light, heed me. You must put a stop to Bahamut's regeneration. 500210 Whether it be for man or for dragonkind, the question of justice is irrelevant. The elder primal will leave naught but a smoldering wasteland for both his children and ours. 500220 I beg you to defend Eorzea as you always have, and as I always knew you would. 500230 I beg you to defend Eorzea, and guide its people to the future they yet struggle to find. 500240 This portal will take you to the final internment hulk. 'Tis time for the tale of Bahamut and his part in the Calamity to come to an end! 500250 Alphinaud, Alisaie. Pray come closer. 500260 Your hopes and dreams must no longer be an extension of mine. You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm your own meaning in this sea of chaos. 500270 Will you do that for me? 500280 Of course, Grandfather. I have already made it my mission to see this newborn Eorzea survive and flourish. 500290 Alisaie. While I was yet in thrall to Bahamut, you spoke of my faith in man's strength. Know that your words reached me, imprisoned though my soul still was. 500300 So forceful was your conviction, I wonder if that belief has not become your own. Perhaps, after all your anger and sorrow was spent, you found something greater within you. 500310 See this fight to its culmination. 'Tis also your strength in which I have faith. 500320 Thank you...for everything... Pray take your rest, Grandfather... You deserve it. 500330 There are records of an art that allowed one to summon the power of a primal from the essence of its demise. 500340 And though I am no true primal, all that I have left, I give to you. 500350 Alphinaud. Alisaie. My darling grandchildren. May Light's blessings ever keep and protect you. 500360 Come, Warrior of Light. Our task remains undone! 600010 'Twas a long and arduous road, but at last we reach its end. 600020 Farewell, Bahamut. I banish you back to the aether! 600030 He is not yet whole! I did not think him capable... 600040 Ah! 600050 Ugh! 600060 Ugh... Alisaie! ALISAIE! 600070 I had thought it finally over... 600080 We'll not survive another blast! 600090 No... Is this how I honor my promise to Grandfather? 600100 You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm your own meaning in this sea of chaos. Will you do that for me? 600110 I will, Grandfather. In fact, I believe I already have. 600120 That reason has been with me all along, guiding me Eorzea's blade of Light, shearing through the endless shrouds of darkness... 600130 I have been shown the miraculous feats of which we are all capable. Of which I am capable. 600140 Bahamut! You have wreaked enough havoc! 600150 I will not let your wrathful fires consume all that we know and love! 600160 Ugh! 600170 How long I have waited to hear you say that! You have found your resolve at last! 600180 Let me join my strength to yours. 600190 In this place, in this moment, our purpose has become one! 600191 (-Alphinaud and Alisaie-)For the future of Eorzea! 600200 This last task is yours, Warrior of Light! You must destroy Bahamut's crystal core! 700010 You did it! 700020 But one task remains... 700030 With this last coil disabled, there shall be naught left to bind Bahamut to this world. His beloved children will finally know peace... 700040 'Tis done. He is truly gone. 700050 You knew, didn't you? You knew what Grandfather had become. 700060 I...was not certain. But from all I had gleaned, it seemed a distinct possibility. 700070 The scene people describe of the Battle of Carteneau was one of unimaginable devastation. And 'tis through the combined prayers of the desperate and an abundant source of aether that primals are born. I merely put two and two together. 700080 And you consider that a sufficient explanation? 700090 Well, however you stumbled across your theory, 'twas this revelation that made you wary of my attachment to Grandfather. 700100 You feared that in my obsession, I would fall under his primal sway. Is that why you decided to join us? To pull me back should I show signs of wavering? 700110 Pray forgive me, Sister. I wished only to protect you. Yet I see now that I needn't have doubted the strength of your conviction. 700120 May I ask you a question? What do you now intend to do with the truth you have uncovered? 700130 Which particular truth was that, Brother? The fact that desperate prayer gave rise to the primal Phoenix? That this new god was responsible for setting Eorzea on the path to rebirth? 700140 Should such a tale become common knowledge, people would soon offer up their prayers in earnest they would beseech Phoenix to complete the healing that was begun. 700150 Yet as you and I know all too well, the very act of calling forth this savior would do more harm to the land than good. 700160 We cannot encourage such worship for this very reason. Were Grandfather forced to return as an aether-draining primal, 'twould undo all that he had worked to protect. 700170 Your abiding love for him was the key that unlocked the truth of the Calamity. 700180 But keys may also serve to seal doors that were best left unopened. 700190 Let your love now guide your actions, and lock away deep inside the fate of both Grandfather and Bahamut. 700200 Fear not, Alphinaud I understand what must be done. 700210 The realm need not know the truth for it to be saved. 700220 That the elder primal is banished, to return no more...that is enough. 700230 Let us make our way back to the surface. Poor Urianger must be beside himself with worry!",

I had hoped to speak with Commander Leveilleur as well, but I cannot afford to wait any longer.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000040</h1>\n\n<p>The lord commander sent me hither to request your aid in a matter of grave import.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000050</h1>\n\n<p>You see now why I had Tataru summon you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000060</h1>\n\n<p>Now that we are all assembled, perhaps you would be good enough to elaborate on the nature of the matter which brought you to us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000070</h1>\n\n<p>The Observatorium's astrologians have sounded the alarum.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000080</h1>\n\n<p>Last night, the dragon star burned with an intensity not seen in fifteen summers.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000090</h1>\n\n<p>Not since the Dravanians engaged the Empire in the Battle of Silvertear Skies.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000100</h1>\n\n<p>\u201cThe northern sky doth burn full bright upon the wyrm lord's call. The red behemoth beckoneth, and flame consumeth all.\u201d</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000110</h1>\n\n<p>The old Coerthan rhyme, aye.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000120</h1>\n\n<p>The brightening of the dragon star is said to accompany the roar of a great wyrm. The astrologians believe that it was Midgardsormr himself who cried out on this occasion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000130</h1>\n\n<p>After an absence of centuries, the king of kings did return to lead his kind against the might of Garlemald...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000140</h1>\n\n<p>...Only to fall in his duel with the Agrius, proud flagship of the Garlean fleet. Devoid of life, his corpse remaineth entwined about the magitek monstrosity even unto this day.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000150</h1>\n\n<p>Urianger has the right of it. Whatever this alteration in the dragon star portends, the great wyrm has shown no sign of life.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000160</h1>\n\n<p>Tataru, have the Domans reported aught out of the ordinary?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000170</h1>\n\n<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if Midgardsormr had roared, wouldn't we have heard it here in Revenant's Toll?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000180</h1>\n\n<p>\u201cRoar\u201d is but a figure of speech. Dravanians can communicate in ways beyond our ken.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000190</h1>\n\n<p>It is for this very reason that we are forced to look for signs in the heavens. We cannot say with any confidence that a great wyrm roared at all, much less that it was Midgardsormr.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000200</h1>\n\n<p>Only by directly examining the Keeper of the Lake can we be certain. However, it will take too long to gain the Holy See's approval to dispatch the Temple Knights.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000210</h1>\n\n<p>Therefore, Ser Aymeric would entrust this task to you. Do you accept?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000220</h1>\n\n<p>We knew you would not disappoint us. Now, if you would excuse me, I must return and assist the lord commander. We have precious little time to prepare.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000230</h1>\n\n<p>To prepare for what, pray tell?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000240</h1>\n\n<p>When a great wyrm roars, his brethren cannot choose but answer. We prepare for battle.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100010</h1>\n\n<p>Who treadeth now upon my bones and waketh me from slumber sweet?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100020</h1>\n\n<p>Thou hast forgotten the face of thy lord. Remember, mortal, and fear me.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200010</h1>\n\n<p>By Her gifts hast thou earned a moment's reprieve.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200020</h1>\n\n<p>Speak, mortal, and I shall listen.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200030</h1>\n\n<p>Guided by a star...? Heh heh heh.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200040</h1>\n\n<p>My people have heard the song. Ishgard shall burn.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200050</h1>\n\n<p>Sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200060</h1>\n\n<p>We do not forget. We do not forgive.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200070</h1>\n\n<p>Seven children did I sire. One now singeth of retribution.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200080</h1>\n\n<p>I rise to join in the chorus.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200090</h1>\n\n<p>Thou art powerless to silence us, mortal. Yet thou shalt not live to labor in vain. Thy reprieve is at an end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200100</h1>\n\n<p>Hmph. Trickery is thy shield. This frail, ignoble creature is not gifted, but chosen...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200110</h1>\n\n<p>Hearken to me, Hydaelyn! I remember...and I consent.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200120</h1>\n\n<p>Fear not, mortal... I shall not harm thee...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200130</h1>\n\n<p>Heh heh heh. Mayhap thou thinkest me an oathbreaker?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200140</h1>\n\n<p>Thou art mistaken. If thou comest to harm, it shall be by another's hand, not mine.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200150</h1>\n\n<p>I did but strip thee of thy mistress's feeble blessing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200160</h1>\n\n<p>Thou didst profit much by Her grace, but no more.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200170</h1>\n\n<p>The covenant binds me to thee.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200180</h1>\n\n<p>I shall watch...listen...and wait.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200190</h1>\n\n<p>Fight and struggle, if it be thy will.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200200</h1>\n\n<p>Man hath ever coveted that which lieth beyond his grasp.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200210</h1>\n\n<p>I drink of Her body, and thence doth mine own find new life.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200220</h1>\n\n<p>When it hath grown whole, the loyal and penitent shall rejoice.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200230</h1>\n\n<p>The Dragonsong heraldeth a beginning...and an end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300010</h1>\n\n<p>My friend! I can scarce believe it! You confronted the wyrm lord and lived to tell the tale!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300020</h1>\n\n<p>I give thanks to Halone for your preservation. It is our sole cause for gladness.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300030</h1>\n\n<p>Your encounter with the Keeper of the Lake served to confirm our fears. A great wyrm has roared, and it makes little difference if it was one of the two in Eorzea or any other...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300040</h1>\n\n<p>The Dravanians are coming.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300050</h1>\n\n<p>I am told that Ishgard has magical defenses against Dravanian attack, though I am not privy to their exact nature.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300060</h1>\n\n<p>Will they be enough to repel a massive force?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300070</h1>\n\n<p>Ishgard has weathered countless assaults over centuries. This will be no different.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300080</h1>\n\n<p>And now that you have confirmed the threat, none can ignore the lord commander's calls for the wards to be strengthened.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300090</h1>\n\n<p>I dare not presume to speak for him, but I expect the lord commander would sing your praises.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300100</h1>\n\n<p>I must away, but we shall meet again soon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300110</h1>\n\n<p>Countless assaults weathered...and this will be no different? Why am I not convinced?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400010</h1>\n\n<p>Now that everything's calmed down a bit\u2500relatively speaking, I mean\u2500I thought it might be a good time to share our progress on the weapon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400020</h1>\n\n<p>I believe we're on the verge of a breakthrough.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400030</h1>\n\n<p>Well, don't keep us all in suspense.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400040</h1>\n\n<p>Just in case anyone's forgotten, let's start by reviewing what we already know. So! An Ascian is an immortal because its soul doesn't return to the aetherial realm when its host is defeated. Instead, it flees to the place that lies between our world and the void.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400050</h1>\n\n<p>Therefore, the first step to permanently defeating an Ascian is preventing its soul from making this journey. And if you recall, when we last gathered here, I had verified that white auracite has adequate capacity to entrap the beings, albeit only briefly.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>Which left the small matter of their extermination.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400070</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. To unmake an Ascian soul, one must needs smite it with a concentrated burst, or \u201cblade,\u201d of purest aether. However, we wanted for both the data and the means to forge such a weapon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400080</h1>\n\n<p>Short of experimenting on an actual Ascian, you see, there's no way to gauge how much aether its soul is made of.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400090</h1>\n\n<p>As such, we don't know what aetheric density our blade needs to have in order for it to work.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400100</h1>\n\n<p>So we'll just have to make the densest blade we can, and hope for the best! Though that would require a lot of aether...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400110</h1>\n\n<p>Hang on a minute! Why didn't we think of this before!? White auracite can hold an absolute heap of aether, can't it!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400120</h1>\n\n<p>Please tell me you're joking. Gods' sakes, Yda! I feel as though I'm reliving the same scene over and over with you! How many times do you need to be told that white auracite cannot store aether for long periods?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400130</h1>\n\n<p>Being intangible matter, aether is given to dispersion; only in its crystallized form is it a stable source of energy. I will test you later on this, so see to it you do not forget.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400140</h1>\n\n<p>Ah...r-right, yes... It's all coming back to me...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400150</h1>\n\n<p>So our hopes rest on good old crystals again, do they? While they are certainly reliable, they leave something to be desired in the area of portability.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400160</h1>\n\n<p>Indeed. I am reminded of the quantity of corrupted crystals required to thwart Leviathan, and the extraordinary lengths to which the Lominsans went to transport them. What if it should prove that a similar quantity was needed to destroy an Ascian soul\u2500or still more...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400170</h1>\n\n<p>I do not envy the poor sod who has to lug all of that around on the off chance that an Ascian appears.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400180</h1>\n\n<p>That's the very problem we set out to solve, and I reckon we've found the answer. If it isn't practical to lug around the aether we need, we'll just have to draw upon another source.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400190</h1>\n\n<p>And the only viable source is the land.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400200</h1>\n\n<p>If you mean to tap the great river of aether, know that it will entail considerable risk. Meddling with the currents may well induce a surge like to the one which despoiled Mor Dhona.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400210</h1>\n\n<p>Give me a bit more credit, will you? Why would we need to tap the river when there're veritable reservoirs jutting out all over the land?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400220</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, I speak of corrupted crystals. It might be that their aspect is out of balance, but a crystal's a crystal\u2500it contains aether, and we can help ourselves to it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400230</h1>\n\n<p>While corrupted crystals are indeed abundant, there is no guarantee that they will be in close proximity at a crucial moment.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400240</h1>\n\n<p>Ah, but what if we don't need them to be? What if we could tap their power from afar? A malm away, say?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400250</h1>\n\n<p>If we could do that, we'd have ready access to aether aplenty in almost every corner of Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400260</h1>\n\n<p>I've yet to put my theories to the proof, but I've got a good feeling about this. If no one has any objections, I'd like to see where this avenue leads.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400270</h1>\n\n<p>If you think it worth your while, you have my blessing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400280</h1>\n\n<p>But tell us, what are your theories? I for one am most eager to understand the process, however vaguely.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400290</h1>\n\n<p>I thought you might say that. But no one wants to listen to boring old theories all day, do they? I know I don't. So, with your permission, I'd like to try something a bit more hands-on. I've already built an aetheric siphon especially for this purpose, and I've been meaning to try it out.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400300</h1>\n\n<p>Thing is, the profusion of corrupted crystals in Mor Dhona makes it something of a high-risk testing ground. If anything goes awry with the siphon, it would be better if it didn't happen within spitting distance of quite so much aether.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400310</h1>\n\n<p>Ideally, I need an isolated specimen. Does anyone know where I can find one?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400320</h1>\n\n<p>May I suggest northern Thanalan? There you will find corrupted crystals of middling size, standing a reasonable distance apart. Ideal for your needs, I should have thought. Oh, and if you do elect to visit the place, I should be much obliged if you would assist me in another matter while you are in the area.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400330</h1>\n\n<p>Has something happened?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400340</h1>\n\n<p>Movement has been observed at Castrum Meridianum.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400350</h1>\n\n<p>During Operation Archon, the Alliance dealt the stronghold a heavy blow. Its facilities were extensively damaged, and its garrison reduced to a fraction of its former strength.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400360</h1>\n\n<p>Not long after our forces withdrew, however, their ranks were replenished by reinforcements from Castrum Centri. They now seek to rebuild, and to this end they have their sights set upon the Ceruleum Processing Plant.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400370</h1>\n\n<p>Having lost the Empire's support, the XIVth Legion lacks the resources to sustain itself. To them, this is a bid for survival, and they will doubtless fight like desperate men.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400380</h1>\n\n<p>Though I have dispatched the Crystal Braves, I fear their strength alone may not suffice to stay the imperial assault. I would request the Scions' aid in the defensive effort.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400390</h1>\n\n<p>If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to inveigle us into fighting your battle with the promise of shiny crystals!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400400</h1>\n\n<p>Well then, consider me inveigled! I won't lie, the crystals you speak of sound perfect\u2500so the Garleans have to go!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400410</h1>\n\n<p>Besides, we can't afford to beat about the bush. There's no telling when the Ascians will next appear.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400420</h1>\n\n<p>Thine eagerness to hurl thyself into the jaws of danger cometh as little surprise. Exercise due caution, I prithee.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400430</h1>\n\n<p>Though you have become a Crystal Brave, you are yet a Scion, Alphinaud. We could hardly refuse you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400440</h1>\n\n<p>Pray join the Crystal Braves and lend them your support. Thancred and Papalymo shall accompany you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400450</h1>\n\n<p>Yda and Y'shtola\u2500in the meantime I would have you assist Moenbryda. Scout out the crystal clusters, that the testing may commence as soon as the Garlean threat has been eliminated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400460</h1>\n\n<p>If it please you, I shall continue mine own experiments on white auracite.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400470</h1>\n\n<p>Thank you, Urianger. Everyone, pray see to your preparations and depart as soon as you are able. Go well, and be safe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500010</h1>\n\n<p>Hold on. I won't be a second.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500020</h1>\n\n<p>The beast seemed peckish, so I gave it a taste of my axe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500030</h1>\n\n<p>I know, I know... As Urianger never tires of reminding me, \u201cAn axe ill becometh the hand of a scholar.\u201d What can I say? I like axes. To hear my mother tell it, I came into this world holding one.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500040</h1>\n\n<p>And it's not as if it stopped me picking up a quill, is it? I often think of the man who introduced me to the joys of learning... He's one of the reasons I decided to come to Eorzea.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500050</h1>\n\n<p>...Him and my excruciatingly stiff childhood friend. Considering how unalike we are, it's a wonder we ever got on. The world's a strange old place, isn't it?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500060</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, that ought to do it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500070</h1>\n\n<p>So far, so good. At these concentrations, it shouldn't matter too much if something goes awry. Just enough aether to make it interesting.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500080</h1>\n\n<p>Did you see that? The way the crystal glowed?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500090</h1>\n\n<p>The siphon works, I'm happy to say. With a few refinements, it should satisfy our appetite for aether. Which just leaves the small matter of forging our blade.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500100</h1>\n\n<p>I'm not sure how to go about it just yet, but I swear to find a way. I'll put a blade in your hands if it's the last thing I do.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500110</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)She senses me. A useful talent.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500120</h1>\n\n<p>An Ascian!? Are they onto us!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500130</h1>\n\n<p>By your brand, I see you are an Archon of Sharlayan. Keeper of knowledge. Seeker of truth. Meddler.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500140</h1>\n\n<p>I don't know what the hells you're saying, but I don't much like your tone.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500150</h1>\n\n<p>Hahaha. Your instincts serve you well. But come, be not unsettled on my account. That lovely brow was not made for frowns. Ah, but I waste my breath.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500160</h1>\n\n<p>Let me direct my words to one who understands them. We meet at last, Warrior of Light. I am Nabriales...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500170</h1>\n\n<p>...And you have long been a thorn in my side. I suffered the overweening presence of Lahabrea that men might host the power of gods, only for you to undo my hard work.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500180</h1>\n\n<p>Yaaarrrgh!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500190</h1>\n\n<p>Oh, bugger...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500200</h1>\n\n<p>Urgh!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500210</h1>\n\n<p>Do settle down.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500220</h1>\n\n<p>You must concede that I acted in self-defense.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500230</h1>\n\n<p>But what's this? I do not sense the blessing of Light...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500240</h1>\n\n<p>Oh dear! Could it be that frail Hydaelyn has forgotten Her champion!? This I did not foresee!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500250</h1>\n\n<p>Shorn of Light as you are, you are no longer a threat. And better yet, the seal is broken.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500260</h1>\n\n<p>Now is the time to claim the staff!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500270</h1>\n\n<p>With it in my grasp, I shall rise above them all and take my place at Lord Zodiark's right hand!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500280</h1>\n\n<p>What did that bastard want with us?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500290</h1>\n\n<p>Nabriales, he calls himself? With charm like that, I'll bet he has maidens falling at his feet. Unconscious.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500300</h1>\n\n<p>But this staff\u2500you say just talking about it had the bastard grinning like a brat on his nameday? Must be quite a staff.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500310</h1>\n\n<p>Oh, gods... He means Tupsimati, Master Louisoix's staff!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500320</h1>\n\n<p>Minfilia's in danger! We have to get back to the Rising Stones!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600010</h1>\n\n<p>You two!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600020</h1>\n\n<p>So you were able to divine my intent. What now, Warrior of Light? Ah, but that name is no longer fitting. You have become decidedly dull, and quite incapable of barring my entry.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600030</h1>\n\n<p>What do you mean!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600040</h1>\n\n<p>You truly do not know? Then I suppose it is only right that I enlighten you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600050</h1>\n\n<p>The blessing of Light kept you and your fellow meddlers safe. It was that which prevented my kind from entering your domain.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600060</h1>\n\n<p>My kind, I say, though it had no power over the likes of Elidibus and Lahabrea. Being of this world, they could come and go as they please, while I could only look on...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600070</h1>\n\n<p>But I need look no longer. Now that the seal is gone, I mean to act. Unlike the others, I am not given to waiting. I shall take that staff and bring about the next Rejoining.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600080</h1>\n\n<p>...Rejoining? Then it was your doing! The Isle of Val, the scholars\u2500all of it!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600090</h1>\n\n<p>You will not harm her!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600100</h1>\n\n<p>Urrrgh!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600110</h1>\n\n<p>Moenbryda!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600120</h1>\n\n<p>Why must you insist on forcing my hand? Did you learn nothing from our last meeting? Ah, but I forget\u2500my words fall upon deaf ears.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600130</h1>\n\n<p>The staff is but a broken relic\u2500a memorial to the departed. What possible use could you have for it?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600140</h1>\n\n<p>What use!? You mean to say that all this time, you kept the key, never knowing what it was you possessed?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600150</h1>\n\n<p>The staff Tupsimati\u2500or rather, the stone tablet it bears\u2500is host to a great power.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600160</h1>\n\n<p>Together with the horn, it can be used to draw vast quantities of aether from its bearer's surroundings.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600170</h1>\n\n<p>How else do you think Louisoix was able to invoke the power of the Twelve without making them an offering of crystals?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600180</h1>\n\n<p>Summoning requires not only prayer, but a profusion of aether. Even a child knows that.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600190</h1>\n\n<p>If I did not know before, you may be certain I do now. But above all, I know that we cannot allow this staff to fall into your hands. I will die before I let you take it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600200</h1>\n\n<p>Insufferable woman. I would happily end your miserable life here and now... Alas, Elidibus would never let me hear the end of it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600210</h1>\n\n<p>Very well. If you will not part with the staff, I will take you too.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600220</h1>\n\n<p>After them! Quickly...before the rift closes!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700010</h1>\n\n<p>It appears I have underestimated you... You are a formidable foe, even without the blessing of Light...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700020</h1>\n\n<p>And now I am forced to reveal this unseemly form. Hmph.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700030</h1>\n\n<p>You're safe... Thank the Twelve...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700040</h1>\n\n<p>You may have bested me this day...but what of the next? What of all the days to come!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700050</h1>\n\n<p>Remember: Light no longer holds sway here. I may return whensoever I wish. Again and again and again. Eventually, you will falter and the staff will be mine. Until next time, Scions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700060</h1>\n\n<p>There will be no next time! This is the end!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700070</h1>\n\n<p>What!? What trickery is this!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700080</h1>\n\n<p>No! Nooo! You cannot! Nooooooooo!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700090</h1>\n\n<p>Use Tupsimati to gather aether! Quickly, before he breaks free!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700100</h1>\n\n<p>Concentrate! Call to mind the time you struck down Lahabrea with the blade of Light!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700110</h1>\n\n<p>Why won't it work? Is it because we lack the blessing of Light?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700120</h1>\n\n<p>Damn it... So much aether...and it still isn't enough...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700130</h1>\n\n<p>Fools! No mortal prison can contain me! I shall make you pay for your insolence!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700140</h1>\n\n<p>Please, Mother Hydaelyn! Hearken to our plea! Lend us Your divine Light!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700150</h1>\n\n<p>Why can You not hear us? Do our words no longer reach You?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700160</h1>\n\n<p>If only we had...a bit more aether...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700170</h1>\n\n<p>Moenbryda! What are you doing!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700180</h1>\n\n<p>Master Louisoix... I understand now...the choice you made...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700190</h1>\n\n<p>In death...there is life... Farewell, Urianger...you daft old coot...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700200</h1>\n\n<p>Moenbryda, no! You mustn't\u2500!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700210</h1>\n\n<p>What!? Nooo! It...it cannot end!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700220</h1>\n\n<p>I am eternal! I am immortaaaaaal!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700230</h1>\n\n<p>Moenbryda... She's...she's gone...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>700240</h1>\n\n<p>You did it, my friend. The Ascian is dead.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800010</h1>\n\n<p>This device is a legacy of Moenbryda's toils and sacrifice.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800020</h1>\n\n<p>I shall hold on to it for safekeeping.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800030</h1>\n\n<p>Minfilia! Are you all right?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800040</h1>\n\n<p>I am.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800050</h1>\n\n<p>We were surveying northern Thanalan when we received the distress call.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800060</h1>\n\n<p>We returned as swiftly as we were able.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800070</h1>\n\n<p>It seems you have everything in hand, however.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800080</h1>\n\n<p>What happened here? Where is Moenbryda?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800090</h1>\n\n<p>She gave her life to temper the blade of Light? I...I have no words.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800100</h1>\n\n<p>Rather than await the inevitable, she took her fate into her own hands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800110</h1>\n\n<p>Does...does Urianger know...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800120</h1>\n\n<p>My friend. There is something I must tell you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800130</h1>\n\n<p>I heard all, my lady.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800140</h1>\n\n<p>The moon sinketh, taking her leave of the heavens. Yet her passing heraldeth the coming of a new day.<br/>\n...Moenbryda hath fulfilled her destiny, hath she not?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800150</h1>\n\n<p>Long ago, far across the seas in the Sharlayan motherland, Moenbryda and I did study under the sage tutelage of Master Louisoix.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800160</h1>\n\n<p>Full oft did he impress upon us that knowledge existeth to serve the greater good. This sentiment, however, was contrary to the nation's policy of neutrality, which censured intercedence in the affairs of foreign lands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800170</h1>\n\n<p>In spite of vehement opposition, he founded the Circle of Knowing and journeyed hither to the heart of Eorzea. Through his noble sacrifice was the realm spared its doom.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800180</h1>\n\n<p>Yet this great soul, whom all should rightly have honored, was branded a pariah in his own land. His peers did accuse him of forsaking his duty as a man of learning, and of meddling in the course of history.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800190</h1>\n\n<p>When he left Sharlayan behind, Master Louisoix gave no word to signal his intent to Moenbryda. Close as they were, as master and disciple, she was deeply wounded by the sudden exclusion from his confidence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800200</h1>\n\n<p>Above all, however, she was confused. Try as she might, she could ill comprehend her master's motive. The slanders that were heaped upon him after his passing served only to inflame the turmoil within her.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800210</h1>\n\n<p>For years upon end, she knew not what to believe, torn as she was 'twixt the man whom she revered, and the man who forsook her and his duty both.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800220</h1>\n\n<p>The Louisoix I knew would never forsake his duty, much less one of his own.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800230</h1>\n\n<p>This I know full well, my lady. 'Twas not for want of love that Master Louisoix hid his intent. He but desired that Moenbryda discover her own path, free of the shadow of his influence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800240</h1>\n\n<p>Long did I contemplate revealing the truth to her, and long did I hold my peace. After all, was it not Master Louisoix's wish that she come to the truth unaided? I told myself it was, and resolved to let her suffer.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800250</h1>\n\n<p>Knowingly did I deny my friend the comfort she craved. And now she hath gone to her rest with doubt still in her heart.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800260</h1>\n\n<p>Speakest thou in earnest? Did Moenbryda truly come to understand Master Louisoix's will before the end?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800270</h1>\n\n<p>The realization hath set her free. She may now find the peace which hath for so long eluded her.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800280</h1>\n\n<p>Oh, Moenbryda... My dearest... How I shall miss thee...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800290</h1>\n\n<p>Moenbryda gave her life that we might possess the means to defeat the Ascians.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800300</h1>\n\n<p>Her sacrifice must not be in vain. Let us continue her work on the blade of aether and see it to completion.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800310</h1>\n\n<p>My lady. I would mourn Moenbryda in mine own way. I beg your permission to return to the Waking Sands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800320</h1>\n\n<p>Of course, my friend. Take all the time you require. We shall be here should you have need of us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900010</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive me, Moenbryda. Had I been quicker, or wiser...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900020</h1>\n\n<p>But I was not, and you paid the price.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900030</h1>\n\n<p>But you would not suffer us to wallow in our sorrow, would you? You would tell us to...pick ourselves up and get on with it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900040</h1>\n\n<p>And so we shall. We shall defend this realm and her people to the last.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900060</h1>\n\n<p>Life for death. A fair exchange.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900070</h1>\n\n<p>Other bargains will be struck.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900050</h1>\n\n<p>I'll never forget you, Moen. None of us will.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900080</h1>\n\n<p>The song riseth to a crescendo.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900090</h1>\n\n<p>Is that what I think it is...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900100</h1>\n\n<p>Hello!? Can you hear me!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900110</h1>\n\n<p>We have received grave tidings from Ishgard.

The main host advances upon Ishgard as we speak.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00050</h1>\n\n<p>Whose vaunted defenses have been nullified.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00060</h1>\n\n<p>Shorn of its wards, the city will bear the full force of Nidhogg's fury.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00070</h1>\n\n<p>All those people...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00080</h1>\n\n<p>Alphinaud is right. The Dravanians cannot be allowed to prevail. If Ishgard falls, all of Eorzea will suffer the consequences.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00090</h1>\n\n<p>Then you agree that we have no choice but to intervene. For the good of the realm, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Crystal Braves must join the defense of Ishgard.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00100</h1>\n\n<p>Let there be no ambiguity about what has been proposed. We would be directly intervening in the war.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00110</h1>\n\n<p>But if all here believe the cause to be just, then to war we shall go.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00120</h1>\n\n<p>The path we now embark upon is perilous, but I pray you will walk with us to the end.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00130</h1>\n\n<p>For those we have lost. For those we can yet save.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00140</h1>\n\n<p>Then it is settled. I shall inform the council of our intentions, and request that they contribute their own forces to the defense of Ishgard.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00010</h1>\n\n<p>We are well aware of Ishgard's dilemma, and we agree with your assessment.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00020</h1>\n\n<p>Then I trust there are no objections to the Crystal Braves' intervention?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00030</h1>\n\n<p>Ul'dah has none.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00040</h1>\n\n<p>Gridania does not object.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00050</h1>\n\n<p>The Crystal Braves are yours to command, Alphinaud.

I know it is within your means.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00070</h1>\n\n<p>Do not presume that you have knowledge of our every concern. The Garleans and the beast tribes are but two of many.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00080</h1>\n\n<p>We are not in a position to contribute greatly to the defense of Ishgard\u2500not when our own homes are still under siege.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00090</h1>\n\n<p>We dare not leave our interests in Carteneau undefended as well.

You would entrust the survival of Ishgard to sellswords!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00160</h1>\n\n<p>Crises like these are the very reason why this alliance was formed! It is our duty to aid our fellow man!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00170</h1>\n\n<p>My duty is to my country and my people.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00180</h1>\n\n<p>If you expect us to place the welfare of a foreign power above our own, you're going to be sorely disappointed.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00190</h1>\n\n<p>Lest you doubt, Limsa comes first, then the Alliance, and finally\u2500circumstances permitting\u2500Ishgard and the rest.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00200</h1>\n\n<p>If you cannot understand so simple a concept, then you have no place at this table.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00210</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive me, Admiral.

Your guest has arrived.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00030</h1>\n\n<p>Pray come in, and take your ease.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00010</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis well that the Steps of Faith held against the Horde.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00020</h1>\n\n<p>And what of the city proper?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00030</h1>\n\n<p>We sustained some few losses, but the heart of our nation yet beats with vigor. I am not certain I could say the same had we not received your most generous aid.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00040</h1>\n\n<p>An attack on Ishgard is an attack on the realm.

The government fails in its responsibilities, and my subjects suffer the consequences of our incompetence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00060</h1>\n\n<p>But I will see them suffer no longer. The victory feast shall provide the stage on which I declare the dissolution of the sultanate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00070</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis mine intent that the ruling class of our golden city should take its place beside the common man in a fair and equitable republic. No more shall this nation bow to the whims of a privileged few.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00080</h1>\n\n<p>Yet that which I propose will entail the tearing up of this city's very foundations. And even Raubahn with all his strength and influence will be hard-pressed to keep his footing on such treacherous ground.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00090</h1>\n\n<p>Thus would I ask you to lend him a steadying hand.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00100</h1>\n\n<p>You who have endured the wrath of innumerable foes are the one hero in whom I can place my trust.

We have received an urgent message from the Holy See.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>M00040</h1>\n\n<p>I am grieved to report that your serpentine foes have resumed their assault.

I must apologize, but my dance card is rather full. Another time, perhaps?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00030</h1>\n\n<p>Thancred of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. You stand accused of committing acts of espionage in service to the Garlean Empire.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00040</h1>\n\n<p>Espionage? What in the seven hells are you talking about?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00050</h1>\n\n<p>Ah. If you're referring to that business with the Ultima Weapon, then you must understand\u2500I-I wasn't myself...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00060</h1>\n\n<p>Under interrogation, an imperial prisoner revealed your involvement in numerous dealings with the enemy. We've also been investigating reports that you are a practitioner of forbidden arts.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00070</h1>\n\n<p>You'd best come along with us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00080</h1>\n\n<p>You invite me to your party and now you want me to leave?

I believe I've lost my appetite for this farce of a celebration!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00010</h1>\n\n<p>You go too far, Lord Adeledji! By what right do you march armed soldiers into a royal banquet and eject state visitors without Her Grace's consent!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00020</h1>\n\n<p>You treat the Brass Blades as your personal army, and show contempt for the throne with your every act. Leave us. Now.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00030</h1>\n\n<p>Is that an order, General? Mayhap you have mistaken me for one of your Flames? You will find I am not so slavishly obedient. And you lecture me on personal armies!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00040</h1>\n\n<p>As for your outrageous claim that I have shown contempt for the throne, let all here observe that it was not I who feasted while an assassin removed its occupant!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00050</h1>\n\n<p>I expect this is your idea of defending the nation, is it? This and diluting our forces through these distractions in Carteneau and Coerthas!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00060</h1>\n\n<p>I do begin to see how the ranks of the Immortal Flames came to be riddled with Garlean sympathizers! You are plainly unfit for command!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00070</h1>\n\n<p>Wait... Wait, gods damn you! Your words make no sense. What assassin?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00080</h1>\n\n<p>You mean to say you don't know!? We caught the vaunted champion of the Scions in Her Grace's private chambers not moments after the deed was done!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00090</h1>\n\n<p>No\u2500 No, this cannot be!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00100</h1>\n\n<p>Save your breath.

It occurs to me that expanding the Brass Blades' authority may not have been such a wonderful idea after all...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>Q00360</h1>\n\n<p>The success of this plan was contingent upon those thugs having the run of the place.

    "text_clean": "000020 I believe the two of you have met? 000030 We have. I had hoped to speak with Commander Leveilleur as well, but I cannot afford to wait any longer. 000040 The lord commander sent me hither to request your aid in a matter of grave import. 000050 You see now why I had Tataru summon you. 000060 Now that we are all assembled, perhaps you would be good enough to elaborate on the nature of the matter which brought you to us. 000070 The Observatorium's astrologians have sounded the alarum. 000080 Last night, the dragon star burned with an intensity not seen in fifteen summers. 000090 Not since the Dravanians engaged the Empire in the Battle of Silvertear Skies. 000100  The northern sky doth burn full bright upon the wyrm lord's call. The red behemoth beckoneth, and flame consumeth all.  000110 The old Coerthan rhyme, aye. 000120 The brightening of the dragon star is said to accompany the roar of a great wyrm. The astrologians believe that it was Midgardsormr himself who cried out on this occasion. 000130 After an absence of centuries, the king of kings did return to lead his kind against the might of Garlemald... 000140 ...Only to fall in his duel with the Agrius, proud flagship of the Garlean fleet. Devoid of life, his corpse remaineth entwined about the magitek monstrosity even unto this day. 000150 Urianger has the right of it. Whatever this alteration in the dragon star portends, the great wyrm has shown no sign of life. 000160 Tataru, have the Domans reported aught out of the ordinary? 000170 Correct me if I'm wrong, but if Midgardsormr had roared, wouldn't we have heard it here in Revenant's Toll? 000180  Roar  is but a figure of speech. Dravanians can communicate in ways beyond our ken. 000190 It is for this very reason that we are forced to look for signs in the heavens. We cannot say with any confidence that a great wyrm roared at all, much less that it was Midgardsormr. 000200 Only by directly examining the Keeper of the Lake can we be certain. However, it will take too long to gain the Holy See's approval to dispatch the Temple Knights. 000210 Therefore, Ser Aymeric would entrust this task to you. Do you accept? 000220 We knew you would not disappoint us. Now, if you would excuse me, I must return and assist the lord commander. We have precious little time to prepare. 000230 To prepare for what, pray tell? 000240 When a great wyrm roars, his brethren cannot choose but answer. We prepare for battle. 100010 Who treadeth now upon my bones and waketh me from slumber sweet? 100020 Thou hast forgotten the face of thy lord. Remember, mortal, and fear me. 200010 By Her gifts hast thou earned a moment's reprieve. 200020 Speak, mortal, and I shall listen. 200030 Guided by a star...? Heh heh heh. 200040 My people have heard the song. Ishgard shall burn. 200050 Sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds. 200060 We do not forget. We do not forgive. 200070 Seven children did I sire. One now singeth of retribution. 200080 I rise to join in the chorus. 200090 Thou art powerless to silence us, mortal. Yet thou shalt not live to labor in vain. Thy reprieve is at an end. 200100 Hmph. Trickery is thy shield. This frail, ignoble creature is not gifted, but chosen... 200110 Hearken to me, Hydaelyn! I remember...and I consent. 200120 Fear not, mortal... I shall not harm thee... 200130 Heh heh heh. Mayhap thou thinkest me an oathbreaker? 200140 Thou art mistaken. If thou comest to harm, it shall be by another's hand, not mine. 200150 I did but strip thee of thy mistress's feeble blessing. 200160 Thou didst profit much by Her grace, but no more. 200170 The covenant binds me to thee. 200180 I shall watch...listen...and wait. 200190 Fight and struggle, if it be thy will. 200200 Man hath ever coveted that which lieth beyond his grasp. 200210 I drink of Her body, and thence doth mine own find new life. 200220 When it hath grown whole, the loyal and penitent shall rejoice. 200230 The Dragonsong heraldeth a beginning...and an end. 300010 My friend! I can scarce believe it! You confronted the wyrm lord and lived to tell the tale! 300020 I give thanks to Halone for your preservation. It is our sole cause for gladness. 300030 Your encounter with the Keeper of the Lake served to confirm our fears. A great wyrm has roared, and it makes little difference if it was one of the two in Eorzea or any other... 300040 The Dravanians are coming. 300050 I am told that Ishgard has magical defenses against Dravanian attack, though I am not privy to their exact nature. 300060 Will they be enough to repel a massive force? 300070 Ishgard has weathered countless assaults over centuries. This will be no different. 300080 And now that you have confirmed the threat, none can ignore the lord commander's calls for the wards to be strengthened. 300090 I dare not presume to speak for him, but I expect the lord commander would sing your praises. 300100 I must away, but we shall meet again soon. 300110 Countless assaults weathered...and this will be no different? Why am I not convinced? 400010 Now that everything's calmed down a bit relatively speaking, I mean I thought it might be a good time to share our progress on the weapon. 400020 I believe we're on the verge of a breakthrough. 400030 Well, don't keep us all in suspense. 400040 Just in case anyone's forgotten, let's start by reviewing what we already know. So! An Ascian is an immortal because its soul doesn't return to the aetherial realm when its host is defeated. Instead, it flees to the place that lies between our world and the void. 400050 Therefore, the first step to permanently defeating an Ascian is preventing its soul from making this journey. And if you recall, when we last gathered here, I had verified that white auracite has adequate capacity to entrap the beings, albeit only briefly. 400060 Which left the small matter of their extermination. 400070 Aye. To unmake an Ascian soul, one must needs smite it with a concentrated burst, or  blade,  of purest aether. However, we wanted for both the data and the means to forge such a weapon. 400080 Short of experimenting on an actual Ascian, you see, there's no way to gauge how much aether its soul is made of. 400090 As such, we don't know what aetheric density our blade needs to have in order for it to work. 400100 So we'll just have to make the densest blade we can, and hope for the best! Though that would require a lot of aether... 400110 Hang on a minute! Why didn't we think of this before!? White auracite can hold an absolute heap of aether, can't it!? 400120 Please tell me you're joking. Gods' sakes, Yda! I feel as though I'm reliving the same scene over and over with you! How many times do you need to be told that white auracite cannot store aether for long periods? 400130 Being intangible matter, aether is given to dispersion; only in its crystallized form is it a stable source of energy. I will test you later on this, so see to it you do not forget. 400140 Ah...r-right, yes... It's all coming back to me... 400150 So our hopes rest on good old crystals again, do they? While they are certainly reliable, they leave something to be desired in the area of portability. 400160 Indeed. I am reminded of the quantity of corrupted crystals required to thwart Leviathan, and the extraordinary lengths to which the Lominsans went to transport them. What if it should prove that a similar quantity was needed to destroy an Ascian soul or still more...? 400170 I do not envy the poor sod who has to lug all of that around on the off chance that an Ascian appears. 400180 That's the very problem we set out to solve, and I reckon we've found the answer. If it isn't practical to lug around the aether we need, we'll just have to draw upon another source. 400190 And the only viable source is the land. 400200 If you mean to tap the great river of aether, know that it will entail considerable risk. Meddling with the currents may well induce a surge like to the one which despoiled Mor Dhona. 400210 Give me a bit more credit, will you? Why would we need to tap the river when there're veritable reservoirs jutting out all over the land? 400220 Aye, I speak of corrupted crystals. It might be that their aspect is out of balance, but a crystal's a crystal it contains aether, and we can help ourselves to it. 400230 While corrupted crystals are indeed abundant, there is no guarantee that they will be in close proximity at a crucial moment. 400240 Ah, but what if we don't need them to be? What if we could tap their power from afar? A malm away, say? 400250 If we could do that, we'd have ready access to aether aplenty in almost every corner of Eorzea. 400260 I've yet to put my theories to the proof, but I've got a good feeling about this. If no one has any objections, I'd like to see where this avenue leads. 400270 If you think it worth your while, you have my blessing. 400280 But tell us, what are your theories? I for one am most eager to understand the process, however vaguely. 400290 I thought you might say that. But no one wants to listen to boring old theories all day, do they? I know I don't. So, with your permission, I'd like to try something a bit more hands-on. I've already built an aetheric siphon especially for this purpose, and I've been meaning to try it out. 400300 Thing is, the profusion of corrupted crystals in Mor Dhona makes it something of a high-risk testing ground. If anything goes awry with the siphon, it would be better if it didn't happen within spitting distance of quite so much aether. 400310 Ideally, I need an isolated specimen. Does anyone know where I can find one? 400320 May I suggest northern Thanalan? There you will find corrupted crystals of middling size, standing a reasonable distance apart. Ideal for your needs, I should have thought. Oh, and if you do elect to visit the place, I should be much obliged if you would assist me in another matter while you are in the area. 400330 Has something happened? 400340 Movement has been observed at Castrum Meridianum. 400350 During Operation Archon, the Alliance dealt the stronghold a heavy blow. Its facilities were extensively damaged, and its garrison reduced to a fraction of its former strength. 400360 Not long after our forces withdrew, however, their ranks were replenished by reinforcements from Castrum Centri. They now seek to rebuild, and to this end they have their sights set upon the Ceruleum Processing Plant. 400370 Having lost the Empire's support, the XIVth Legion lacks the resources to sustain itself. To them, this is a bid for survival, and they will doubtless fight like desperate men. 400380 Though I have dispatched the Crystal Braves, I fear their strength alone may not suffice to stay the imperial assault. I would request the Scions' aid in the defensive effort. 400390 If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to inveigle us into fighting your battle with the promise of shiny crystals! 400400 Well then, consider me inveigled! I won't lie, the crystals you speak of sound perfect so the Garleans have to go! 400410 Besides, we can't afford to beat about the bush. There's no telling when the Ascians will next appear. 400420 Thine eagerness to hurl thyself into the jaws of danger cometh as little surprise. Exercise due caution, I prithee. 400430 Though you have become a Crystal Brave, you are yet a Scion, Alphinaud. We could hardly refuse you. 400440 Pray join the Crystal Braves and lend them your support. Thancred and Papalymo shall accompany you. 400450 Yda and Y'shtola in the meantime I would have you assist Moenbryda. Scout out the crystal clusters, that the testing may commence as soon as the Garlean threat has been eliminated. 400460 If it please you, I shall continue mine own experiments on white auracite. 400470 Thank you, Urianger. Everyone, pray see to your preparations and depart as soon as you are able. Go well, and be safe. 500010 Hold on. I won't be a second. 500020 The beast seemed peckish, so I gave it a taste of my axe. 500030 I know, I know... As Urianger never tires of reminding me,  An axe ill becometh the hand of a scholar.  What can I say? I like axes. To hear my mother tell it, I came into this world holding one. 500040 And it's not as if it stopped me picking up a quill, is it? I often think of the man who introduced me to the joys of learning... He's one of the reasons I decided to come to Eorzea. 500050 ...Him and my excruciatingly stiff childhood friend. Considering how unalike we are, it's a wonder we ever got on. The world's a strange old place, isn't it? 500060 Aye, that ought to do it. 500070 So far, so good. At these concentrations, it shouldn't matter too much if something goes awry. Just enough aether to make it interesting. 500080 Did you see that? The way the crystal glowed? 500090 The siphon works, I'm happy to say. With a few refinements, it should satisfy our appetite for aether. Which just leaves the small matter of forging our blade. 500100 I'm not sure how to go about it just yet, but I swear to find a way. I'll put a blade in your hands if it's the last thing I do. 500110 (-???-)She senses me. A useful talent. 500120 An Ascian!? Are they onto us!? 500130 By your brand, I see you are an Archon of Sharlayan. Keeper of knowledge. Seeker of truth. Meddler. 500140 I don't know what the hells you're saying, but I don't much like your tone. 500150 Hahaha. Your instincts serve you well. But come, be not unsettled on my account. That lovely brow was not made for frowns. Ah, but I waste my breath. 500160 Let me direct my words to one who understands them. We meet at last, Warrior of Light. I am Nabriales... 500170 ...And you have long been a thorn in my side. I suffered the overweening presence of Lahabrea that men might host the power of gods, only for you to undo my hard work. 500180 Yaaarrrgh! 500190 Oh, bugger... 500200 Urgh! 500210 Do settle down. 500220 You must concede that I acted in self-defense. 500230 But what's this? I do not sense the blessing of Light... 500240 Oh dear! Could it be that frail Hydaelyn has forgotten Her champion!? This I did not foresee! 500250 Shorn of Light as you are, you are no longer a threat. And better yet, the seal is broken. 500260 Now is the time to claim the staff! 500270 With it in my grasp, I shall rise above them all and take my place at Lord Zodiark's right hand! 500280 What did that bastard want with us? 500290 Nabriales, he calls himself? With charm like that, I'll bet he has maidens falling at his feet. Unconscious. 500300 But this staff you say just talking about it had the bastard grinning like a brat on his nameday? Must be quite a staff. 500310 Oh, gods... He means Tupsimati, Master Louisoix's staff! 500320 Minfilia's in danger! We have to get back to the Rising Stones! 600010 You two! 600020 So you were able to divine my intent. What now, Warrior of Light? Ah, but that name is no longer fitting. You have become decidedly dull, and quite incapable of barring my entry. 600030 What do you mean!? 600040 You truly do not know? Then I suppose it is only right that I enlighten you. 600050 The blessing of Light kept you and your fellow meddlers safe. It was that which prevented my kind from entering your domain. 600060 My kind, I say, though it had no power over the likes of Elidibus and Lahabrea. Being of this world, they could come and go as they please, while I could only look on... 600070 But I need look no longer. Now that the seal is gone, I mean to act. Unlike the others, I am not given to waiting. I shall take that staff and bring about the next Rejoining. 600080 ...Rejoining? Then it was your doing! The Isle of Val, the scholars all of it! 600090 You will not harm her! 600100 Urrrgh! 600110 Moenbryda! 600120 Why must you insist on forcing my hand? Did you learn nothing from our last meeting? Ah, but I forget my words fall upon deaf ears. 600130 The staff is but a broken relic a memorial to the departed. What possible use could you have for it? 600140 What use!? You mean to say that all this time, you kept the key, never knowing what it was you possessed? 600150 The staff Tupsimati or rather, the stone tablet it bears is host to a great power. 600160 Together with the horn, it can be used to draw vast quantities of aether from its bearer's surroundings. 600170 How else do you think Louisoix was able to invoke the power of the Twelve without making them an offering of crystals? 600180 Summoning requires not only prayer, but a profusion of aether. Even a child knows that. 600190 If I did not know before, you may be certain I do now. But above all, I know that we cannot allow this staff to fall into your hands. I will die before I let you take it. 600200 Insufferable woman. I would happily end your miserable life here and now... Alas, Elidibus would never let me hear the end of it. 600210 Very well. If you will not part with the staff, I will take you too. 600220 After them! Quickly...before the rift closes! 700010 It appears I have underestimated you... You are a formidable foe, even without the blessing of Light... 700020 And now I am forced to reveal this unseemly form. Hmph. 700030 You're safe... Thank the Twelve... 700040 You may have bested me this day...but what of the next? What of all the days to come!? 700050 Remember: Light no longer holds sway here. I may return whensoever I wish. Again and again and again. Eventually, you will falter and the staff will be mine. Until next time, Scions. 700060 There will be no next time! This is the end! 700070 What!? What trickery is this!? 700080 No! Nooo! You cannot! Nooooooooo! 700090 Use Tupsimati to gather aether! Quickly, before he breaks free! 700100 Concentrate! Call to mind the time you struck down Lahabrea with the blade of Light! 700110 Why won't it work? Is it because we lack the blessing of Light? 700120 Damn it... So much aether...and it still isn't enough... 700130 Fools! No mortal prison can contain me! I shall make you pay for your insolence! 700140 Please, Mother Hydaelyn! Hearken to our plea! Lend us Your divine Light! 700150 Why can You not hear us? Do our words no longer reach You? 700160 If only we had...a bit more aether... 700170 Moenbryda! What are you doing!? 700180 Master Louisoix... I understand now...the choice you made... 700190 In death...there is life... Farewell, Urianger...you daft old coot... 700200 Moenbryda, no! You mustn't ! 700210 What!? Nooo! It...it cannot end! 700220 I am eternal! I am immortaaaaaal! 700230 Moenbryda... She's...she's gone... 700240 You did it, my friend. The Ascian is dead. 800010 This device is a legacy of Moenbryda's toils and sacrifice. 800020 I shall hold on to it for safekeeping. 800030 Minfilia! Are you all right? 800040 I am. 800050 We were surveying northern Thanalan when we received the distress call. 800060 We returned as swiftly as we were able. 800070 It seems you have everything in hand, however. 800080 What happened here? Where is Moenbryda? 800090 She gave her life to temper the blade of Light? I...I have no words. 800100 Rather than await the inevitable, she took her fate into her own hands. 800110 Does...does Urianger know...? 800120 My friend. There is something I must tell you. 800130 I heard all, my lady. 800140 The moon sinketh, taking her leave of the heavens. Yet her passing heraldeth the coming of a new day. ...Moenbryda hath fulfilled her destiny, hath she not? 800150 Long ago, far across the seas in the Sharlayan motherland, Moenbryda and I did study under the sage tutelage of Master Louisoix. 800160 Full oft did he impress upon us that knowledge existeth to serve the greater good. This sentiment, however, was contrary to the nation's policy of neutrality, which censured intercedence in the affairs of foreign lands. 800170 In spite of vehement opposition, he founded the Circle of Knowing and journeyed hither to the heart of Eorzea. Through his noble sacrifice was the realm spared its doom. 800180 Yet this great soul, whom all should rightly have honored, was branded a pariah in his own land. His peers did accuse him of forsaking his duty as a man of learning, and of meddling in the course of history. 800190 When he left Sharlayan behind, Master Louisoix gave no word to signal his intent to Moenbryda. Close as they were, as master and disciple, she was deeply wounded by the sudden exclusion from his confidence. 800200 Above all, however, she was confused. Try as she might, she could ill comprehend her master's motive. The slanders that were heaped upon him after his passing served only to inflame the turmoil within her. 800210 For years upon end, she knew not what to believe, torn as she was 'twixt the man whom she revered, and the man who forsook her and his duty both. 800220 The Louisoix I knew would never forsake his duty, much less one of his own. 800230 This I know full well, my lady. 'Twas not for want of love that Master Louisoix hid his intent. He but desired that Moenbryda discover her own path, free of the shadow of his influence. 800240 Long did I contemplate revealing the truth to her, and long did I hold my peace. After all, was it not Master Louisoix's wish that she come to the truth unaided? I told myself it was, and resolved to let her suffer. 800250 Knowingly did I deny my friend the comfort she craved. And now she hath gone to her rest with doubt still in her heart. 800260 Speakest thou in earnest? Did Moenbryda truly come to understand Master Louisoix's will before the end? 800270 The realization hath set her free. She may now find the peace which hath for so long eluded her. 800280 Oh, Moenbryda... My dearest... How I shall miss thee... 800290 Moenbryda gave her life that we might possess the means to defeat the Ascians. 800300 Her sacrifice must not be in vain. Let us continue her work on the blade of aether and see it to completion. 800310 My lady. I would mourn Moenbryda in mine own way. I beg your permission to return to the Waking Sands. 800320 Of course, my friend. Take all the time you require. We shall be here should you have need of us. 900010 Forgive me, Moenbryda. Had I been quicker, or wiser... 900020 But I was not, and you paid the price. 900030 But you would not suffer us to wallow in our sorrow, would you? You would tell us to...pick ourselves up and get on with it. 900040 And so we shall. We shall defend this realm and her people to the last. 900060 Life for death. A fair exchange. 900070 Other bargains will be struck. 900050 I'll never forget you, Moen. None of us will. 900080 The song riseth to a crescendo. 900090 Is that what I think it is...? 900100 Hello!? Can you hear me!? 900110 We have received grave tidings from Ishgard. Pray return to the Rising Stones at once. 900120 Twelve forfend, is the hour already upon us!? 900130 Come. Our enemies do not rest, and neither will we. A00010 (-Iceheart-)The sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds. Only then will the cycle be broken... A00020 (-Iceheart-)Brothers and sisters of the heavens! We raise our voices and join you in the chorus! A00030 (-Iceheart-)The sinners' feeble magicks are undone! Come! Claim your retribution! A00040 (-Iceheart-)Ahahahahahah! C00010 Alphinaud, it is good to see you. Tell me, what have you learned? C00020 Pray summon the others. Everyone must hear my report. C00030 So this was all but a taste of what's to come... C00040 Indeed. The main host advances upon Ishgard as we speak. C00050 Whose vaunted defenses have been nullified. C00060 Shorn of its wards, the city will bear the full force of Nidhogg's fury. C00070 All those people... C00080 Alphinaud is right. The Dravanians cannot be allowed to prevail. If Ishgard falls, all of Eorzea will suffer the consequences. C00090 Then you agree that we have no choice but to intervene. For the good of the realm, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Crystal Braves must join the defense of Ishgard. C00100 Let there be no ambiguity about what has been proposed. We would be directly intervening in the war. C00110 But if all here believe the cause to be just, then to war we shall go. C00120 The path we now embark upon is perilous, but I pray you will walk with us to the end. C00130 For those we have lost. For those we can yet save. C00140 Then it is settled. I shall inform the council of our intentions, and request that they contribute their own forces to the defense of Ishgard. D00010 We are well aware of Ishgard's dilemma, and we agree with your assessment. D00020 Then I trust there are no objections to the Crystal Braves' intervention? D00030 Ul'dah has none. D00040 Gridania does not object. D00050 The Crystal Braves are yours to command, Alphinaud. Do what you will. We shall pray for your success. D00060 It was my hope that you would offer more substantial aid than prayer. I know it is within your means. D00070 Do not presume that you have knowledge of our every concern. The Garleans and the beast tribes are but two of many. D00080 We are not in a position to contribute greatly to the defense of Ishgard not when our own homes are still under siege. D00090 We dare not leave our interests in Carteneau undefended as well. Teledji Adeledji and his ilk would seize control of the territories in our absence. D00100 The enemy is at their gates, and you would cower behind yours!? D00110 No one is cowering, boy. We will offer what support we can. D00120 Aye. Support. A handful of men and no more. D00130 Would that we could commit more than a token force to this cause. Yet there are others to whom you might turn. The free companies ever want for work. D00140 Ah, yes, the free companies... They're not like to turn you down. D00150 I beg your pardon!? You would entrust the survival of Ishgard to sellswords!? D00160 Crises like these are the very reason why this alliance was formed! It is our duty to aid our fellow man! D00170 My duty is to my country and my people. D00180 If you expect us to place the welfare of a foreign power above our own, you're going to be sorely disappointed. D00190 Lest you doubt, Limsa comes first, then the Alliance, and finally circumstances permitting Ishgard and the rest. D00200 If you cannot understand so simple a concept, then you have no place at this table. D00210 Forgive me, Admiral. I was...careless in my choice of words. D00220 I suggest you assemble a party of elite adventurers, assuming you haven't already. Your fellows served us well during Operation Archon. I daresay they will do so again. D00230 If I may, Your Grace, I wish to propose a redistribution of forces. D00240 If we entrust the security of Ul'dah to the Brass Blades for a time, we can dispatch a larger force to Ishgard. D00250 Your Grace? D00260 Yes, yes of course. Do what you will. D00270 Is Her Grace not feeling well? D00280 To the best of my knowledge, Her Grace is in perfect health. D00290 I see. Carry on. F00010 O Sultantree, hallowed spirit of my line... F00020 Through my weakness, the glorious House of Ul has all but disappeared beneath the sands. For want of the strength to raise it up again, it were better that it fall. F00030 Forgive me, but I know not what else to do... G00010 You needn't trouble yourself so. G00020 Your Grace is most kind, but it is no trouble to me, rather an honor. G00030 If Your Grace is ready, I shall summon the Warrior of Light. G00040 I am. H00010 I take it you have grown accustomed to your responsibilities? H00020 The day-to-day duties are not so demanding. The social obligations, on the other hand... H00030  Everyone looks to be in high spirits. H00040 With good cause. H00050 A common victory may serve to unite even the most unlikely of allies. H00060 You've brought us one step closer to a united Eorzea. H00070 Your modesty knows no bounds, Antecedent. H00080 Were it not for your efforts, Ser Aymeric would never have become such a steadfast ally. H00090 When he convinces his countrymen to rejoin the Alliance, we shall all reap the benefits military and economic. H00100 I tell you, we are on the cusp of a new era of unity and prosperity. H00110 Territorial disputes are all that divide us now. H00120 But I have faith that we will find an amicable solution in time. H00130 And failing that, I'll have my trusty Warrior of Light box the ears of all concerned. Speaking of whom...? H00140 She will be joining us shortly. A matter at the Quicksand required her attention, but it did not sound serious. I00010 Enter. I00020 Your Grace. Your guest has arrived. I00030 Pray come in, and take your ease. J00010 'Tis well that the Steps of Faith held against the Horde. J00020 And what of the city proper? J00030 We sustained some few losses, but the heart of our nation yet beats with vigor. I am not certain I could say the same had we not received your most generous aid. J00040 An attack on Ishgard is an attack on the realm. We stand together or fall divided. J00050 Such noble words...after the fact. J00060 I had hoped to speak in the presence of Her Grace, but it seems she has been delayed... That being the case, now would seem as good a time as any... J00070 Honored friends! Pray allow me to convey Ishgard's warmest gratitude for your part in the defense of our lands. J00080 'Tis upon the success of this very alliance that my recommendation to throw open the Gates of Judgement shall be founded. With the blessing of the archbishop, it is my hope that Ishgard will soon be reunited with her long-estranged sister nations and that Eorzea shall once more be as one! J00090 Very well. J00100 Is aught amiss? J00110 Nothing to worry about. I shall return anon. J00120 You wished a word, Yuyuhase? K00010 You may go. K00020 Your Grace. K00030 You must be curious as to the reason for this private audience. The matter I would discuss, however, will soon make apparent the need for discretion. K00040 I intend to abdicate the throne and dissolve the monarchy. K00050 You have seen for yourself the storm of turmoil that howls through our streets. The government fails in its responsibilities, and my subjects suffer the consequences of our incompetence. K00060 But I will see them suffer no longer. The victory feast shall provide the stage on which I declare the dissolution of the sultanate. K00070 'Tis mine intent that the ruling class of our golden city should take its place beside the common man in a fair and equitable republic. No more shall this nation bow to the whims of a privileged few. K00080 Yet that which I propose will entail the tearing up of this city's very foundations. And even Raubahn with all his strength and influence will be hard-pressed to keep his footing on such treacherous ground. K00090 Thus would I ask you to lend him a steadying hand. K00100 You who have endured the wrath of innumerable foes are the one hero in whom I can place my trust. Will you do this thing for me? K00110 I am truly grateful. More grateful than I can well express. K00120 How much we have both changed since that day we met beneath the Sultantree... And the days ahead promise to change us further still. I hope that we will recognize ourselves when all of this is over... K00130 Much of my dread for the coming days has been quieted... K00140 Your Grace!? K00150 Her Grace... The sultana is dead. K00160 Poison in her wine...? K00170 You! You did this! K00180 Spare us your denials! I see no other suspects, and the room has but the one entrance! K00190 I hereby accuse you of regicide! Men arrest this viper! K00200 (-Brass Blade-)Sir! You're coming with us! L00010 <gasp> L00020 (-Crystal Brave-)Sir. Barring a few exceptions, we have detained all those with allegiance to the Scions. The Rising Stones is also under our control. L00030 And what do you hope to achieve with this mutiny? L00040 Why, that which we have striven for all along, Commander: the salvation of Eorzea. M00010 What is the meaning of this? M00020 Knights from the homeland? This cannot bode well... M00030 Lord Commander. We have received an urgent message from the Holy See. M00040 I am grieved to report that your serpentine foes have resumed their assault. Needless to say, your presence is urgently required. These knights have come to bear you swiftly home to Ishgard. M00050 ...A surprise attack? M00060 We've had no such word from our men. And the timing is most fortuitous to catch us away from the city... M00070 Most fortuitous indeed... M00080 Lord Commander, we must away! M00090 You have been a most gracious host. I hope that I might one day return the favor. M00100 Come, Lucia. N00010 Whatever is going on in there...? N00020 Ah, the ever-dutiful Brass Blades. I must apologize, but my dance card is rather full. Another time, perhaps? N00030 Thancred of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. You stand accused of committing acts of espionage in service to the Garlean Empire. N00040 Espionage? What in the seven hells are you talking about? N00050 Ah. If you're referring to that business with the Ultima Weapon, then you must understand I-I wasn't myself... N00060 Under interrogation, an imperial prisoner revealed your involvement in numerous dealings with the enemy. We've also been investigating reports that you are a practitioner of forbidden arts. N00070 You'd best come along with us. N00080 You invite me to your party and now you want me to leave? I do so detest receiving mixed signals. N00090 Come, then. I believe I've lost my appetite for this farce of a celebration! O00010 You go too far, Lord Adeledji! By what right do you march armed soldiers into a royal banquet and eject state visitors without Her Grace's consent!? O00020 You treat the Brass Blades as your personal army, and show contempt for the throne with your every act. Leave us. Now. O00030 Is that an order, General? Mayhap you have mistaken me for one of your Flames? You will find I am not so slavishly obedient. And you lecture me on personal armies! O00040 As for your outrageous claim that I have shown contempt for the throne, let all here observe that it was not I who feasted while an assassin removed its occupant! O00050 I expect this is your idea of defending the nation, is it? This and diluting our forces through these distractions in Carteneau and Coerthas! O00060 I do begin to see how the ranks of the Immortal Flames came to be riddled with Garlean sympathizers! You are plainly unfit for command! O00070 Wait... Wait, gods damn you! Your words make no sense. What assassin? O00080 You mean to say you don't know!? We caught the vaunted champion of the Scions in Her Grace's private chambers not moments after the deed was done! O00090 No  No, this cannot be! O00100 Save your breath. You will need it to plead your case. You and your entire order are to be tried for this atrocity. O00110 Bring in the prisoner! P00010 This woman stands accused of poisoning Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo. And as suspected accessories to the crime, all members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn will be detained for questioning! P00020 This is madness! P00030 What a pity... Who'd have thought your tale would end like this? P00040 Should you demand further proof, a vial with traces of the substance used to poison Her Grace was found upon the assassin's person. P00050 How very convenient. P00060 You would speak of convenience? P00070 Who persuaded Her Grace to host this celebration? A diversion which presented you and your confederates ample opportunity to commit the crime, and a crowd within which to fade from view! A more  convenient  occasion I could scarcely imagine! P00080 How dare you! After all we have done for Ul'dah! P00090 Hold your tongue, witch! I'll not be ensorcelled! I know all about the dark gift that you and your disciples wield! P00100 Oh, yes...I've observed how you worked upon the minds of the Alliance leaders, bending them to your will! P00110 And what of your cordial relationship with Ser Aymeric? For years, Ishgard abjured all contact with the outside world, and now the lord commander of the Temple Knights treats you with the familiarity of a childhood friend! P00120 I'll tell you what I think I think this desperate defense of Ishgard was but a ruse to deceive us into dividing our forces. P00130 Your next move will be to charm your Coerthan allies into invading our lands! P00140 Now that is truly ridiculous. P00150 How do you even think of this stuff!? P00160 She... She cannot be dead... P00170 Stand aside, Ilberd! I want to see the sultana! P00180 Spare yourself the pain, brother. I saw her with my own eyes. P00190 For a mercy, the poison took her swiftly her handmaiden can attest to that. P00200 This cannot be... P00210 Nanamo... Nanamo... NOOOOOO!!! Q00010 Plainly, the Royalists can no longer be relied upon to keep our nation safe. And so it falls to the Monetarists of the Syndicate to govern Ul'dah. But should you wish to help us, General, we would be more than happy to entrust the task of planning Her Grace's funeral to you. Q00020 It seems only right that you should bury your precious sultana, and we will be glad to be rid of that burden. Q00030 I'll bet you will. You more than any man. Q00040 ...Whatever do you mean? Q00050 I mean you had her killed, you black-hearted bastard! Q00060 What rot! ...Though I did have sufficient motive, 'tis true. That young lady caused me no end of grief. Q00070 She always was a most unwilling puppet. I daresay Her Grace was grateful that someone thought to cut her strings. Q00080 You would mock her? THEN MOCK HER FROM HELL! Q00090 Wha  Q00100 Have you lost your mind, General!? It is forbidden to draw steel in the royal chambers, much less slaughter our fellow Syndicate members! Q00110 <gasp> ...You're one of them! You've been in league with the Scions all along! Q00120 YOU! You're next, you scheming bastard! Q00130 AAARRRGH!!! Q00140 Seven hells! Q00150 Raubahn! Q00160 (-Maelstrom Soldier-)Admiral, we must leave! Q00180 How unlike you, old friend. I did not expect to take your arm so easily. Q00230 Take the Scions into custody! They have conspired to commit regicide! Q00240 And arrest this traitor as well! Q00190 Ilberd! I hope you choke on their coin! Q00200 'Tis better than the dirt I've supped on these long years. We can't all abandon Ala Mhigo and become great war heroes as you have. Q00210 You are not the man you once were, Raubahn. Since that girl strapped the yoke around your neck, you've become docile. Q00220 She took the mad bull and cut off his balls. And a bull that cannot rut is fit for naught but slaughter. Q00250 Shall I tell you who really killed your precious sultana? Q00251 ...It was me. Q00260 You! You die! Q00270 Hmph. Q00280 I never doubted you. Not for a moment. But there is more to this than I yet understand. Q00290 Flee this place. Clear your names. Q00300 Find out who is behind this plot! It is the only way! Now go! Q00310 Yaaaaaargh! Q00320 Ah, there you are! Q00330 Thancred! Where have you been? Q00340 Avoiding the fumbling advances of some very persistent admirers. Q00341 When I realized the celebrations had turned sour, it seemed prudent to slip away and take stock of the situation. Q00350 'Twould appear that much of the city is already under tight guard. It occurs to me that expanding the Brass Blades' authority may not have been such a wonderful idea after all... Q00360 The success of this plan was contingent upon those thugs having the run of the place. Just how long has this scheme been in motion? Q00370 The careful preparations, the maneuvering of forces... I am inclined to agree with the General's insistence that a deeper plot exists here. Q00380 So...would I be right in thinking we now have an excuse to pummel as many Brass Blades as we like? Q00390 Unless you plan on pummeling them all, I'm not sure that will greatly aid our cause. Q00400 The sultana's assassination was but one part of the scheme. We too were its targets. And though we did not share poor Nanamo's fate, we are yet hobbled by the charges laid at our door. Where now might we seek refuge? Q00410 Where indeed. We may safely assume that our foe has thought to have the Rising Stones watched. Q00420 Forgive me for stating the obvious, but our choice of destination will matter little if we cannot secure an escape route out of Ul'dah. Q00430 Happily, I believe I can provide one. Papashan once told me about the passages hidden in the walls of the palace. If I recall correctly, the fireplace in Nanamo's chambers conceals the entrance to a tunnel. Q00440 It should lead outside the city, and allow us to avoid any messy confrontations. Q00450 The rest of you go on ahead. I'll handle this lot! Q00460 By yourself!? Q00461 <sigh> ...I suppose I shall just have to join you. Q00480 Crystal Braves, too, huh? Now this should be interesting! Q00470 Yda! Papalymo! Q00490 We will hold our pursuers here. Hurry, now! Find this tunnel of Thancred's! Q00500 Minfilia! We cannot linger! R00010 Ow! Now look what you've done! R00020 Yda, are you all right!? There are just too many of them... R00030 I'm fine! I could do this all day! How about you? R00040 ...Nearing the end of my tether. R00050 This is so stupid! We're the Scions of the Seventh Dawn! The ones who stand between this realm and the evil that's trying to destroy it! R00060 And if you think we'll leave the stewardship of Eorzea to the likes of your masters, then you're sorely mistaken! R00070 Sorry I dragged you into this, Papalymo... R00080 Hah, 'tis hardly the first time. And I'll be damned if it will be the last. R00090 Let them have it, Yda! R00100 I was hoping you'd say that! S00010 I never knew such a watercourse existed beneath Ul'dah. S00020 The architecture is of the Sil'dihn style, if I am not mistaken. The ancients plainly foresaw the need for a ready means of escape. S00030 (-???-)This way! S00040 Well, that didn't take long. It seems these tunnels were not as secret as I had hoped. S00050 You two go on ahead. Thancred and I will deal with this. S00060 Wh-What do you mean to do!? S00070 Only that which is required to ensure that the dawn's light survive to brighten the morrow. S00080 Fear not, Antecedent. You haven't seen the last of these fair features. S00090 My friends... S00100 Leave us! S00110 What is the plan, milady? Shall I take the dozen on the left, and you the dozen on the right? The odds are not exactly stacked in our favor... S00120 Numbers will count for little when I bring the tunnel down upon their heads. Though I cannot say I relish the thought of being entombed with you for all eternity. S00130 You wound me! I will have you know that many a maid would kill for the chance to spend forever at my side! Now, may I have the last dance? S00140 Ugh! S00150 Well, this is going splendidly... Now would be a good time, milady! S00160 'Tis done! S00170 Forgive me, Mhitra... S00180 Farewell, Minfilia... T00010 Hydaelyn... She speaks to me. T00020 No! T00030 I must remain behind...but you cannot stay with me. T00040 Please, you must go on! You are the Warrior of Light! You are hope for the Scions, and for all the realm! T00050 As long as your flame continues to burn, the light of the dawn may ever be relit! T00060 You must escape, and save Eorzea from those who would plunge it into darkness! T00070 'Tis the only way... U00010 I am glad to see you safe, my friend! What of the others? U00020 Damn that man! U00030 Teledji played me for a fool! I thought the Crystal Braves mine till the very moment I felt the blade at my back... U00040 (-???-)There will be ample time for soul-searching later. For now, we must put some malms between us and Ul'dah. U00050 Well, if it ain't the hero of the Scions! You look to me like a woman in need of a nice, relaxin' carriage ride! U00060 Well, would you look who it is! Need a ride? I doubt it'll be half as excitin' as the last trip we took not if I have anythin' to say about it, anyway! U00070 Let's not dawdle, eh? All aboard! V00010 I was stockin' up on supplies over in Vesper Bay, you see, when your sister come up an' begged a favor. Said her brother was havin' some trouble down in Ul'dah, an' likely needed a helpin' hand gettin' away. V00020 Thinkin' them ruins would make a fine hidin' place, I decided to try there first...an' lo an' behold, there you were. V00030 Aye, an' judgin' by them soldiers as were pourin' out of the city, I arrived not a moment too soon... V00040 Must've been fate that we happened to find you there though, eh? V00050 I had thought to look out for Alisaie, but 'twould appear she was the one watching over me. I've made such a mess of things... V00060 An' who might you be, young sir? V00070 Pipin Tarupin, Vice Marshal of the Immortal Flames. V00080 I had been on the Ala Mhigan front these past few moons, but an urgent communication called me back to Ul'dah. V00090 Scarce had my boots touched the cobbles, though, when the streets erupted with cries of assassination. I immediately went in search of answers, and came across Master Alphinaud here. Needless to say, I did not think his imprisonment justified. V00100 The blame plainly lies with the Monetarists. Their greed and corruption are well known to me, but for them to take advantage of the situation with such alacrity... V00110 ...Was that  Pipin,  you said? Ain't that the name of General Aldynn's lad? V00120 Yes, I am his son. Adopted, of course. 'Twas only as we were leaving Ul'dah that I learned of Father's fate. V00130 Once I have seen you a safe distance away, I mean to return to the city and extricate him from this madness. V00140 Then you needn't travel no further than Black Brush our fugitives have a friend waitin' for 'em there. V00150 I dreamed of bringing about Eorzea's salvation, but in the end... V00160 'Twas I who needed saving. W00010 There has been word from the capital. Ishgard has weathered another assault, and 'tis said several wyverns broke through into the city proper. W00020 The Temple Knights succeeded in slaying the beasts, but the intrusion prompted orders to further strengthen the guard and to place the city under a perpetual state of alert. W00030 How keenly we feel the loss of our wards at the Gates of Judgement... W00040 Yet we must not bemoan our misfortune. Ser Aymeric is safely returned from Ul'dah and once more leads the defense of Ishgard. W00050 As for the matter of your asylum, I am afraid no progress will be made until the threat to our nation has diminished. W00060 But do not despair! You are not without allies. W00070 You are more than welcome to shelter here for as long as you wish. Pray think of it as a new headquarters of sorts the  Falling Snows  or some such! W00080 All frivolity aside, any who come here in search of you will receive no aid from House Fortemps. For once, the Ishgardian reputation for inhospitality shall work in our favor. W00090 Agents of Ul'dah will find their every inquiry dismissed, and their every request for entry rebuffed, until such time as their masters have acknowledged your innocence. W00100 You once fought to preserve the honor of my dear friend 'tis a blessing that I may now repay that debt in kind. W00110 But let us dwell no more on this. Pray join the rest of your companions. W00120 'Tis bitterly cold this day. I suspect there are those who might welcome the warmth your presence brings. X00010 'Tis all my doing... X00020 I believed myself the only one who truly understood Eorzea's woes. And look what that arrogance has wrought. X00030 I gave commands, influenced governments with my certainty... X00040 I treated the Crystal Braves, and even the Scions themselves, as pawns in my great scheme to save the realm. X00050 But in my headlong rush unto imagined glory, I paid no heed to the ground upon which I trod! X00060 The salvation of Eorzea... What was it that I hoped to achieve? X00070 Did I believe that I could rid the realm of every danger and difficulty? That I could defeat the Empire and the Ascians, and find homes for every refugee? X00080 Oh yes, I was so very clever.  Become a guardian of Eorzea,  I implored, and sat back to watch my perfect army cleanse the land of chaos. X00090 'Twas all but a means to feed my own vanity. X00100 Only when all is lost do I finally realize the truth. X00110 Oh, Alphinaud... X00120 So, Master Alphinaud, are you content to remain a broken blade? Is there no flame hot enough to reforge you? X00130 What of the fine companions who yet stand at your side? I daresay the fires of their determination will soon have you slicing the air again with your customary wit! X00140 I hardly deserve such friendship. And besides, where are we to go...? X00150 Alphinaud? If I may...? X00160 Should this place not serve our purpose, then...then we shall go to Ishgard! X00170 Minfilia told me many times: as long as we stand fast against despair, the beacon of hope will never be lost to sight. X00180 Be it in the snow or in the clouds, we few will see that the dawn's light shines again! X00190 <sniff> <sniff> X00200 You are right, Tataru, thank you. And thank you for your kind words, Lord Haurchefant. X00210 'Tis true that Eorzea yet has her guardians. X00220 The Scions have achieved much, and 'twould be remiss of me to discard it all in a fit of self-pity. X00230 Let us then resume our journey, together...one step at a time. Y00010 All has been arranged as you desired, my lord. Y00020 Hmph. Z00010 Heh heh heh. Thou thinkest sanctuary lieth beyond? Z00020 Delusion. Despair. Death. Thou shalt find naught else here.",

Cloud sea swells and He comes! 700040 The White! The White! Mighty Bismarck, Lord of the Mists! 700050 A flying whale!? By the Fury, i-it's a primal! 700060 We must away! 700070 Damn! 700080 Bloody typical... All right we're going in! 700090 (-Biggs and Wedge-)Aye aye, chief! 700100 All aboard! 800010 The hero returns! I cannot thank you enough for saving young Emmanellain's life. Aye, aye he told me everything. 800020 I've also received letters from both House Dzemael and Durendaire praising your conduct and that of House Fortemps. You've won us much honor, my friend. 800030 My lord! 800040 What is it? Speak. 800050 Pray forgive the intrusion, my lord, but I-I bring grave tidings! 800060 Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru have been detained on suspicion of fomenting heresy! 800070 What? Explain! 800080 They...they were observed entering a tavern in the lower levels on some half-dozen occasions. There, it is claimed, they made a number of inquiries... 800090 Inquiries which brought them into contact with certain...ahem...elements. 'Twas this which prompted a knight of the Heavens' Ward to demand that they be questioned. Ser Grinnaux, my lord... 800100 Ser Grinnaux is a brute an exceedingly accomplished brute, but a brute nonetheless. Alas, he is also a son of House Dzemael. 800110 How quickly we forget the petty nature of men. I'd wager your friends are no more than pawns in another of my countrymen's games. Such is the way of things between the High Houses... 900010 We are gathered here today, under the watchful gaze of the Fury, to ascertain the guilt of two souls in a trial by combat! Petitioners, step forward! 900020 Ser Grinnaux for the benefit of all here present, I would ask you to repeat the charges which you have leveled against this man and this woman. 900030 I, Ser Grinnaux de Dzemael, brother of the Heavens' Ward, did bear witness to these two foreigners consorting with heretics! 900040 Let the accused step forward! 900050 Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru you have heard the charges leveled against you. 900060 Will you take up arms to refute Ser Grinnaux's claim and thereby prove your innocence in the eyes of gods and men? 900070 I, Alphinaud Leveilleur, am innocent of this charge, and claim my right to trial by combat! 900080 I, Tataru Taru, am innocent of this charge... 900090 But I am no warrior, and cannot fight, so I claim the right to name a champion! 900100 To the old and the infirm, the young and the weak, this right we allow. Very well. Who will stand for this woman? 900110 Just as I was beginning to doubt the efficacy of the Ishgardian justice system! Come, my friend let us put an end to this mummer's farce! 900120 O Halone, render unto us Your judgment! Raise up the righteous, and cast down the wicked! A00010 Your Eminence, it is my honor to present to you the Warrior of Light. A00020 I have heard the tales of your many grand endeavors. The lord commander has also been most effusive in his praise. A00030 I am Thordan VII, Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, and I bade you come here that I might offer my personal apologies.  A00040 You will forgive me for not calling upon you as courtesy would dictate, but as you can see, my more sprightly days are long behind me. But I digress. A00050 Your companions were wrongly accused of heresy and subjected to gross indignities. This, I am sorry to say, was the result of negligence on the part of our nation's protectors negligence born of an excess of zeal. Is that not so, Ser Zephirin? A00060 Yes, Your Eminence... Regrettably, it would appear that we of the Heavens' Ward were in receipt of erroneous information. A00070 Ser Grinnaux has ever been headstrong. He pressed charges before the truth had been ascertained, for which I most sincerely apologize. A00080 An unfortunate misunderstanding born of an earnest desire to serve Ishgard but one which should never have occurred... A00090 For who could doubt the character of those who bested Shiva and drove the Horde from the Steps of Faith? Not I, that much is certain. A00100 That will be all, Ser Zephirin. I would speak with our guest in private. A00110 Your Eminence? I  A00120 As you wish, Your Eminence. That will be all for today! A00130 Privacy is a luxury rarely afforded one in my position. A00140 Now, tell me, young lady: what do you know of the Ascians? A00150 Much and more, I shouldn't wonder, being the Bringer of Light. You should know that I myself have met with them have entertained them as guests, even. A00160 Those harbingers of chaos and strife offered us power, that we might continue our war against the dragons. A00170 I have no intention of aiding their cause, of course, nor less of being their puppet. A00180 Yet were I to refuse them outright, I should learn naught of their true objectives and remain powerless to stop them. A00190 Thus have I hearkened to their words with interest, and paid lip service to their beliefs, biding my time and preparing for the inevitable conflict. A00200 And why do I tell you this? Because there is naught in this world they fear more than the power of the Warrior of Light. A00210 If we are to rid ourselves of these vile interlopers, we must needs work together. With our combined strength, I have faith that we can wrest Eorzea from their grasp, and pave the way for a lasting peace. Think on it. B00010 There you are. I confess, I was more than a little concerned when I learned that you had been summoned to the Vault. What did they want with you? B00020 Well, well. A formal apology and an admonishment of those responsible? I see my fears were wholly misplaced. B00030 By the gods, the archbishop freely admits to consorting with Ascians? So their ambitions extend to Ishgard as well... B00040 We will have new primals to contend with ere long, of that you may be certain. 'Tis but a matter of time. Yet shorn of the support of our missing allies, what can we realistically hope to achieve? B00050 Ahhh! In the midst of all the excitement, I completely forgot to tell you! B00060 When I was asking around about the Scions, I heard the most awful rumor! B00070 General Raubahn is to be executed for crimes against the sultanate! B00080 If the Flame General dies, we will lose a staunch ally, and the one man capable of holding the sultana's assassins to account. B00090 Lord Haurchefant was wise to counsel restraint, but this business will brook no delay. B00100 We cannot permit this execution to take place. We must save Raubahn!",

    "text_html": "<h1>000020</h1>\n\n<p>Thankfully, we had allies there who took us under their wing. And theirs was not the only aid we received, I suspect.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000030</h1>\n\n<p>When we fled Ul'dah, we fully expected to become wanted men, known to all and hounded at every turn. Yet that did not come to pass. On the contrary, 'twould seem the charges against us have not been made public. Might we have you to thank for that, Admiral?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000040</h1>\n\n<p>Sharp as ever, Master Alphinaud. On Marshal Tarupin's urging, the Elder Seedseer and I demanded that the Syndicate suppress news of the Scions' alleged crimes until such time as irrefutable evidence could be found.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000050</h1>\n\n<p>Our argument was simple: lacking proof, to accuse the saviors of the realm of so unlikely a crime would have the people up in arms. In their wisdom, the Syndicate agreed, as you yourself have seen.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000060</h1>\n\n<p>There is something you should know. Some few days prior to the banquet, the Elder Seedseer and I were summoned for a private audience with the sultana.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000070</h1>\n\n<p>There, she revealed her intent to announce her abdication, that she might pave the way for the establishment of an Ul'dahn republic.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000080</h1>\n\n<p>What? But such an announcement would have plunged the entire nation into chaos!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000090</h1>\n\n<p>She was well aware of that. 'Twas for fear of what might ensue that she summoned us. Her Grace wanted the Elder Seedseer and I to lend Raubahn a helping hand, you see\u2500to aid him in preserving the peace during the transition.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000100</h1>\n\n<p>So...having somehow caught wind of her plan, Lolorito and Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination in the hope of maintaining the constitutional status quo...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000110</h1>\n\n<p>But they must have known that her death would sow as much chaos as her abdication\u2500chaos from which Teledji alone might feasibly stand to profit. Surely Lolorito would never knowingly\u2500</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000120</h1>\n\n<p>Ah. Could it be...? I dare not hope...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000130</h1>\n\n<p>The Ul'dahn authorities have yet to announce the sultana's passing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000140</h1>\n\n<p>To allay any suspicion that may arise from Her Grace's absence, they have issued a statement to the effect that she is presently convalescing from illness.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000150</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap they're waiting for a fitting moment to break the news. Or mayhap they know of some other reason to delay.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000160</h1>\n\n<p>Something else has been bothering me, Admiral. I was dismayed to learn that General Raubahn is to be executed\u2500yet upon hearing the news, I could not help but wonder why he had been kept alive for so long.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000170</h1>\n\n<p>Pray mistake not my meaning\u2500I am, of course, overjoyed that our friend still draws breath, and that he might yet be saved. But if his enemies truly wished to eliminate him, they could have done so immediately. I see no reason for this delay.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000180</h1>\n\n<p>Aye... You've struck upon an important point, Master Alphinaud.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000190</h1>\n\n<p>Following his capture, Raubahn had been held in the Marasaja Pit within Ul'dah. In recent days, however, he has reportedly been moved to an unknown location.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000200</h1>\n\n<p>Queerly, 'twas not the Brass Blades who spirited him away, either, but a band of soldiers decked in blue...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000210</h1>\n\n<p>The Crystal Braves.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000220</h1>\n\n<p>Aye. If I read the winds aright, the arrangement between Lord Lolorito and the Braves has come under strain.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000230</h1>\n\n<p>At any rate, if we're to rescue Raubahn, we'll have to find him first. And you'll be glad to hear that I have already entrusted the task to those best able to see it done\u2500our friends of Doma.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100010</h1>\n\n<p>Pray forgive me my lateness.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100020</h1>\n\n<p>Lady Yugiri!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100030</h1>\n\n<p>Master Alphinaud. I am pleased to see that the light of resolve shines in your eyes once more.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100040</h1>\n\n<p>Ah, yes... How pathetic I must have seemed to you when we last met. I am ashamed to recall it. For a time I was well and truly lost. But with the aid of my comrades, I have since refound my purpose, and I shall take care not to misplace it again.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100050</h1>\n\n<p>Since your escape from Ul'dah, my fellow shinobi and I have shadowed the Crystal Braves' every step in hopes of learning the Scions' whereabouts.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100060</h1>\n\n<p>Regrettably, our investigation has yet to yield any useful information. Pray forgive us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100070</h1>\n\n<p>You need not apologize, my lady\u2500we are grateful for all that you have done on our behalf. Besides, Raubahn is no less a friend, and we cannot well abandon him to his fate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100080</h1>\n\n<p>Hozan\u2500the three of us shall attend to the Flame General's rescue. Pray draw away the guards by the entrance. Take Doware and Higiri with you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100090</h1>\n\n<p>With me!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200010</h1>\n\n<p>This changes nothing!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200020</h1>\n\n<p>It is over, Ilberd! Lay down your arms and surrender yourself to justice!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200030</h1>\n\n<p>Justice!? Justice for what exactly? 'Twas not I who assassinated the sultana, boy!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200040</h1>\n\n<p>Ere we debate who is responsible for the assassination, I would ask whether an assassination took place at all.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200050</h1>\n\n<p>Clever little shite...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200060</h1>\n\n<p>If you think you fight for justice, lass, you'd best wake up. The truth is, you fight for whoever bloody well tells you to. Can you not see you're being used!? By the Scions, the city\u2013states, even the Crystal Braves. They none of 'em care a whit what you want\u2500only what you can do for them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200070</h1>\n\n<p>And how do I know this? Because I'm the same\u2500a pawn to be used as my masters see fit. All I ever wanted was to liberate my homeland, and I ate dirt to make it happen. But what have I achieved after all these years in servitude? Nothing! Not a bloody thing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200080</h1>\n\n<p>If we ourselves are not free\u2500free to think and to act\u2500how are we ever to reclaim our homeland? Know this: there is nothing I would not give to take back Ala Mhigo! NOTHING!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200090</h1>\n\n<p>You'll not get away!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>200100</h1>\n\n<p>No, Master Alphinaud. Now is not the time.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300010</h1>\n\n<p>I'm but a cripple and a fool, and still you came for me... I'm in your debt.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300020</h1>\n\n<p>We are all of us fools of fate, General. But even fools have a part to play.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>Q1</h1>\n\n<p>What will you say to Raubahn?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A1</h1>\n\n<p>We stand with you.<br/>\nOn your feet, gladiator. This fight is not over.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300030</h1>\n\n<p>Rest assured, I was not planning to die till I'd avenged the sultana... Still, your words are welcome, lass.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300040</h1>\n\n<p>Know this, Ilberd... There is nothing I would not give to see you pay for what you've done. My wealth, my arm, my life...nothing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300050</h1>\n\n<p>General\u2500are you aware that Lord Lolorito has yet to announce the sultana's death to the public?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300060</h1>\n\n<p>...What? No. No, I was not aware of that\u2500nor of anything else outside my cell. 'Tis passing strange, though... I assumed the bastard would make it known at the first opportunity and set about tearing down the sultanate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300070</h1>\n\n<p>As did we all. And it is indeed strange that he did not\u2500strange or perhaps revealing? Now, I have no conclusive proof, nor do I wish to give you false hope...but I have reason to believe that Her Grace may yet live.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300080</h1>\n\n<p>What? But how can that be?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>300090</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive me, friends, but it is not safe here. Let us continue this conversation without.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400010</h1>\n\n<p>My dearest friends! Praise be unto the Twelve for delivering you from the clutches of treachery.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400020</h1>\n\n<p>Father!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400030</h1>\n\n<p>Pipin, my son... And Master Papashan besides...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400040</h1>\n\n<p>Forgive me, Father... I should have been at Her Grace's side...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400050</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)Save your tears. The sultana yet lives.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>You...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400070</h1>\n\n<p>(-???-)It was I who arranged this gathering.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400080</h1>\n\n<p>And judging by your perplexed expressions, it would seem introductions are in order. I am Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal, and member of the Syndicate.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400090</h1>\n\n<p>What you said about the sultana\u2500is it true? Is she alive?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400100</h1>\n\n<p>Young lady\u2500I understand you were with the sultana when she drank from the poisoned goblet and collapsed. Would I be correct in assuming that you did not personally verify Her Grace's vital signs?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400110</h1>\n\n<p>Why ask, when 'tis plain you know the answer!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400120</h1>\n\n<p>Calm yourself, General, and let me finish. The truth is not as you imagine it. You are all victims of a most ingenious ruse\u2500a ruse conceived to eliminate the threat posed by Teledji Adeledji.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400130</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis my belief that Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination alone, but that Lolorito caught wind of his plot, and exploited it to his own ends.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400140</h1>\n\n<p>He sought to manipulate you into eliminating Teledji for him, and you duly obliged.

    "text_clean": "000020 Thankfully, we had allies there who took us under their wing. And theirs was not the only aid we received, I suspect. 000030 When we fled Ul'dah, we fully expected to become wanted men, known to all and hounded at every turn. Yet that did not come to pass. On the contrary, 'twould seem the charges against us have not been made public. Might we have you to thank for that, Admiral? 000040 Sharp as ever, Master Alphinaud. On Marshal Tarupin's urging, the Elder Seedseer and I demanded that the Syndicate suppress news of the Scions' alleged crimes until such time as irrefutable evidence could be found. 000050 Our argument was simple: lacking proof, to accuse the saviors of the realm of so unlikely a crime would have the people up in arms. In their wisdom, the Syndicate agreed, as you yourself have seen. 000060 There is something you should know. Some few days prior to the banquet, the Elder Seedseer and I were summoned for a private audience with the sultana. 000070 There, she revealed her intent to announce her abdication, that she might pave the way for the establishment of an Ul'dahn republic. 000080 What? But such an announcement would have plunged the entire nation into chaos! 000090 She was well aware of that. 'Twas for fear of what might ensue that she summoned us. Her Grace wanted the Elder Seedseer and I to lend Raubahn a helping hand, you see to aid him in preserving the peace during the transition. 000100 So...having somehow caught wind of her plan, Lolorito and Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination in the hope of maintaining the constitutional status quo...? 000110 But they must have known that her death would sow as much chaos as her abdication chaos from which Teledji alone might feasibly stand to profit. Surely Lolorito would never knowingly  000120 Ah. Could it be...? I dare not hope... 000130 The Ul'dahn authorities have yet to announce the sultana's passing. 000140 To allay any suspicion that may arise from Her Grace's absence, they have issued a statement to the effect that she is presently convalescing from illness. 000150 Mayhap they're waiting for a fitting moment to break the news. Or mayhap they know of some other reason to delay. 000160 Something else has been bothering me, Admiral. I was dismayed to learn that General Raubahn is to be executed yet upon hearing the news, I could not help but wonder why he had been kept alive for so long. 000170 Pray mistake not my meaning I am, of course, overjoyed that our friend still draws breath, and that he might yet be saved. But if his enemies truly wished to eliminate him, they could have done so immediately. I see no reason for this delay. 000180 Aye... You've struck upon an important point, Master Alphinaud. 000190 Following his capture, Raubahn had been held in the Marasaja Pit within Ul'dah. In recent days, however, he has reportedly been moved to an unknown location. 000200 Queerly, 'twas not the Brass Blades who spirited him away, either, but a band of soldiers decked in blue... 000210 The Crystal Braves. 000220 Aye. If I read the winds aright, the arrangement between Lord Lolorito and the Braves has come under strain. 000230 At any rate, if we're to rescue Raubahn, we'll have to find him first. And you'll be glad to hear that I have already entrusted the task to those best able to see it done our friends of Doma. 100010 Pray forgive me my lateness. 100020 Lady Yugiri! 100030 Master Alphinaud. I am pleased to see that the light of resolve shines in your eyes once more. 100040 Ah, yes... How pathetic I must have seemed to you when we last met. I am ashamed to recall it. For a time I was well and truly lost. But with the aid of my comrades, I have since refound my purpose, and I shall take care not to misplace it again. 100050 Since your escape from Ul'dah, my fellow shinobi and I have shadowed the Crystal Braves' every step in hopes of learning the Scions' whereabouts. 100060 Regrettably, our investigation has yet to yield any useful information. Pray forgive us. 100070 You need not apologize, my lady we are grateful for all that you have done on our behalf. Besides, Raubahn is no less a friend, and we cannot well abandon him to his fate. 100080 Hozan the three of us shall attend to the Flame General's rescue. Pray draw away the guards by the entrance. Take Doware and Higiri with you. 100090 With me! 200010 This changes nothing! 200020 It is over, Ilberd! Lay down your arms and surrender yourself to justice! 200030 Justice!? Justice for what exactly? 'Twas not I who assassinated the sultana, boy! 200040 Ere we debate who is responsible for the assassination, I would ask whether an assassination took place at all. 200050 Clever little shite... 200060 If you think you fight for justice, lass, you'd best wake up. The truth is, you fight for whoever bloody well tells you to. Can you not see you're being used!? By the Scions, the city states, even the Crystal Braves. They none of 'em care a whit what you want only what you can do for them. 200070 And how do I know this? Because I'm the same a pawn to be used as my masters see fit. All I ever wanted was to liberate my homeland, and I ate dirt to make it happen. But what have I achieved after all these years in servitude? Nothing! Not a bloody thing. 200080 If we ourselves are not free free to think and to act how are we ever to reclaim our homeland? Know this: there is nothing I would not give to take back Ala Mhigo! NOTHING! 200090 You'll not get away! 200100 No, Master Alphinaud. Now is not the time. 300010 I'm but a cripple and a fool, and still you came for me... I'm in your debt. 300020 We are all of us fools of fate, General. But even fools have a part to play. Q1 What will you say to Raubahn? A1 We stand with you. On your feet, gladiator. This fight is not over. 300030 Rest assured, I was not planning to die till I'd avenged the sultana... Still, your words are welcome, lass. 300040 Know this, Ilberd... There is nothing I would not give to see you pay for what you've done. My wealth, my arm, my life...nothing. 300050 General are you aware that Lord Lolorito has yet to announce the sultana's death to the public? 300060 ...What? No. No, I was not aware of that nor of anything else outside my cell. 'Tis passing strange, though... I assumed the bastard would make it known at the first opportunity and set about tearing down the sultanate. 300070 As did we all. And it is indeed strange that he did not strange or perhaps revealing? Now, I have no conclusive proof, nor do I wish to give you false hope...but I have reason to believe that Her Grace may yet live. 300080 What? But how can that be? 300090 Forgive me, friends, but it is not safe here. Let us continue this conversation without. 400010 My dearest friends! Praise be unto the Twelve for delivering you from the clutches of treachery. 400020 Father! 400030 Pipin, my son... And Master Papashan besides... 400040 Forgive me, Father... I should have been at Her Grace's side... 400050 (-???-)Save your tears. The sultana yet lives. 400060 You... 400070 (-???-)It was I who arranged this gathering. 400080 And judging by your perplexed expressions, it would seem introductions are in order. I am Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal, and member of the Syndicate. 400090 What you said about the sultana is it true? Is she alive? 400100 Young lady I understand you were with the sultana when she drank from the poisoned goblet and collapsed. Would I be correct in assuming that you did not personally verify Her Grace's vital signs? 400110 Why ask, when 'tis plain you know the answer! 400120 Calm yourself, General, and let me finish. The truth is not as you imagine it. You are all victims of a most ingenious ruse a ruse conceived to eliminate the threat posed by Teledji Adeledji. 400130 'Tis my belief that Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination alone, but that Lolorito caught wind of his plot, and exploited it to his own ends. 400140 He sought to manipulate you into eliminating Teledji for him, and you duly obliged. At one fell swoop, he removed his two foremost rivals, all the while remaining above suspicion. 400150 Gods strike me down for a fool... But the sultana how can it be that she lives? 400160 She lives because Lolorito willed it. Her own lady-in-waiting is but one of his many little birds; by her sleight of hand, the poison was switched for a less deadly draft before it could reach her mistress's lips. 400170 Some manner of sedative, perchance...of a potency sufficient to induce a slumber like unto death. 400180 Were I to guess, I would say Her Grace is being held somewhere, dreaming dreams of a brighter Ul'dah, even as we speak. 400190 Oh, Nanamo... 400200 I will never forgive Lolorito for his part in this. 400210 Though Lolorito's hands are far from clean, they did pluck Her Grace from the jaws of death. That must count for something. 400220 And though one may call the man's methods into question, it cannot be denied that he knows the value of stability to the very gil, like as not. He craves power, 'tis true, but he has no desire to depose the sultana. 400230 I had never taken sides in your feud with the Monetarists, but it was not for want of concern for our nation's welfare. Indeed, 'twas out of the desire to see order restored that I furnished your Far Eastern friends with information, and arranged this gathering. 400240 I hope you are ready to work, General, for there is much work to be done. Our first priority must be to bring matters back into balance. Lest you forget Her Grace's words, the true wealth of Ul'dah lies in the health, happiness, and hopes of her people. 400250 As for the more worldly kind of wealth, I am content to let Lolorito help himself to whatever Teledji Adeledji left behind. 400260 You, meanwhile, must do that which you alone can do: rescue Her Grace and take your place at her side once more. For her sake...and that of our nation.",

He knew that all too soon, death would snatch her away from him.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Unable to bear the thought of their separation, the maid bid the wyrm consume her, that their spirits might be entwined for eternity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400070</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)...Though loath to perform the deed, Hraesvelgr ultimately gave in to her plea, and soon thereafter, the tale of their ill-fated love spread throughout the two warring factions. No more could they raise blade or claw against one another, knowing that the souls of their kin were so inextricably bound.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400080</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)In the days that followed, man and dragon learned to live in harmony, and together built a nation unlike any the world had ever known. For two hundred years did this blissful age of peace continue, as it would to this day, had vilest envy not stirred in the hearts of the Elezen.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400090</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)It is said that wyrms owe their longevity to the boundless reserves of vitality found within their eyes\u2500and 'twas in this belief that a traitorous band of knights deceived their allies of some two centuries, and took by force that which they coveted...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500010</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Nidhogg\u2500he who now stands poised to unleash his wyrmlings upon Ishgard\u2500was the great dragon who lost an eye to Elezen treachery.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500020</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)And until he prises it from the hands of the traitors' progeny, no amount of conciliatory words will stay his fury.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500030</h1>\n\n<p>You are wrong, Lady Iceheart.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500040</h1>\n\n<p>Lest you misunderstand, I do not doubt your vision of the past\u2500'tis true that Nidhogg greatly desired to reclaim the Eye.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500050</h1>\n\n<p>Indeed, it was for that very reason that I kept it with me as I roamed the land, attempting to draw him away from the city.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500060</h1>\n\n<p>Good gods...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500070</h1>\n\n<p>Until recently, Nidhogg seemed unable to resist its allure, and pursued me relentlessly. Needless to say, that is no longer the case. Now, it would seem he has fixed his attention on Ishgard itself, though he knows full well the Eye does not reside there.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500080</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)You believe he targets the capital for another reason...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500090</h1>\n\n<p>I believe reason has all but left him. Through the Eye, I feel much of what Nidhogg feels, and the dragon's thirst for vengeance will not be quenched by aught less than a sea of blood.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500100</h1>\n\n<p>If Nidhogg is indeed lost to reason, might we not seek an audience with Hraesvelgr instead?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500110</h1>\n\n<p>He has thus far shown no inclination to aid in the invasion of Ishgard, and may yet welcome our efforts to broker a peace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500120</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)You still believe that a peaceable solution can be found? Very well. I will take you to him.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>500130</h1>\n\n<p>(-Iceheart-)Our road will lead us to Dravania, the homeland of dragonkind. There we shall ascend unto the clouds, where Hraesvelgr resides...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600010</h1>\n\n<p>Is aught amiss, my friend?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600020</h1>\n\n<p>I sense the many battles are beginning to take their toll. Rest awhile. And should you lose sight of us\u2500Dravania lies beyond the mountains to the west.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600030</h1>\n\n<p>Curious... The vestiges of thy mistress's blessing are not as faint as once they were...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>600040</h1>\n\n<p>Thy will to succeed grants thee unusual fortitude.

Would that I had come sooner...and not out of dire necessity.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800040</h1>\n\n<p>Thou art troubled.

We are here on a mission of peace!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800100</h1>\n\n<p>My sire's will forbiddeth me from inviting discord to our home...

Dost thou imagine thyself equal to the task\u2500to succeed where dragons have failed?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800180</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis beyond thee, mortal. But thou art welcome to try, nonetheless. Only know that idle promises shall avail thee naught!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>800190</h1>\n\n<p>It would seem we have no choice but to make good on Alphinaud's offer. Why must our every bid for peace breed yet more war?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810010</h1>\n\n<p>Now we have but to wait...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810020</h1>\n\n<p>O Lord Ravana! Master of the Sacred Blades!

We have captured intruders, and would make unto You an offering of their life's blood...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810070</h1>\n\n<p>These feeble fleshlings dared to invade Gnath lands?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810080</h1>\n\n<p>Hear me, Lord Ravana! My companion and I did not come to contest your children's territory.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810090</h1>\n\n<p>We wished only to learn the reason you wage war against the dragons.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810100</h1>\n\n<p>Thou wouldst flirt with death merely to satisfy thy curiosity? Wherefore should the glorious conquests of the Gnath concern thee so, Elezen?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810110</h1>\n\n<p>...Ahhh, mayhap thine own kind's struggle against the wyrms fareth poorly, and thou art desirous of a pact.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810120</h1>\n\n<p>We crave no alliance, Lord Ravana\u2500only peace. We would bring an end to our war with the dragons. Yet so long as they remain embroiled in this conflict with your children, our goal shall remain out of reach.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810130</h1>\n\n<p>Never before have the Gnath risen up in such numbers, and never yet with you at their head. Why do you lead them to war?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810140</h1>\n\n<p>Thy question hath no meaning. To live is but to fight.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810150</h1>\n\n<p>Long have my children waited, gathering their strength in the shadow of thy ceaseless conflict.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810160</h1>\n\n<p>The Gnath would see the Dravanians slain, and their territory secured\u2500and by such fervent prayers am I now given form and purpose.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810170</h1>\n\n<p>As I feared, your very existence is an obstacle to our goal. Since you are so fond of fighting, we challenge you, Lord of the Gnath!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810180</h1>\n\n<p>And should we emerge the victors, I would have you swear to withdraw your soldiers from Dravanian soil!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810190</h1>\n\n<p>Gahahaha! Thou art bold indeed to risk thy fleshy hide so readily!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810200</h1>\n\n<p>Very well. I, Ravana, fourfold master of the blade, do accept thy challenge!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810210</h1>\n\n<p>But should I emerge the victor, I would have thee swear to serve in mine army till thy last breath is spent! Do you accept!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810220</h1>\n\n<p>I do! And I believe the first bout is mine!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810230</h1>\n\n<p>What is this!? A god clad in flesh!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810240</h1>\n\n<p>Is aught amiss, my lord? Thou wilt not break thy word, I trust.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810250</h1>\n\n<p>Mine oath is unbending as steel, little goddess! Thy ruse will but add to mine enjoyment!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810260</h1>\n\n<p>I thought myself...stronger... Mayhap with more crystals...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810270</h1>\n\n<p>Be thou god or maid, thou art nothing to me! ...And what of thee, mortal? Art thou warrior or craven?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>810280</h1>\n\n<p>A warrior, then! Good! Mayhap thou wilt provide more sport than thy feeble companion!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>820010</h1>\n\n<p>Thus doth the sacred rite of combat proclaim the victor...<br/>\nI lay my blades at thy feet, child of man...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>820020</h1>\n\n<p>You do not disappoint, Warrior of Light. Would that I had your skill in battle. ...I do begin to see why so many place their faith in you.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>820030</h1>\n\n<p>For all his savagery, I do not think Ravana one to break his word. Provided the dragons do not trespass upon Gnath lands, they should have little to fear of the primal's biting blades. We have done well, have we not? Come, let us return to Vidofnir and share these glad tidings.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>820040</h1>\n\n<p>Once more you achieve the impossible, Bringer of Light... But with every mortal heart that succumbs to fear and fury, another voice is joined to the chorus beseeching divine succor.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>820050</h1>\n\n<p>At their bidding, warring gods will shake the firmament, and your world will be consumed in the swelling storm of chaos...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900010</h1>\n\n<p>To the peak of Sohm Al, at the end of a perilous mountain path...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900020</h1>\n\n<p>Whence could be seen a string of pearl-like islands,<br/>\nfloating impossibly atop a sea of clouds.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900030</h1>\n\n<p>To a domain where dragons and men had once lived in harmony, whose majesty<br/>\nno mortal eye had glimpsed for nigh on a thousand years, they came.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00010</h1>\n\n<p>Mortals... Why do you disturb my solitude?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00020</h1>\n\n<p>Hraesvelgr...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00030</h1>\n\n<p>Thou speakest the name of a creature that but awaiteth the release of oblivion. Leave me...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00031</h1>\n\n<p>By the Twelve... Mine ears hear the tongue of dragons, yet the meaning rings clear within my mind... How can that be...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00040</h1>\n\n<p>Hraesvelgr...do you not remember me? 'Twas I whom you found in Dravania\u2500I who glimpsed the truth.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00050</h1>\n\n<p>The truth about your past, about Shiva\u2500</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00060</h1>\n\n<p>Do not speak her name, mortal!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00070</h1>\n\n<p>But speak it I must! I have summoned Shiva's soul from the beyond, and offered myself as her vessel! She has made her heart known to me!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00080</h1>\n\n<p>Foolish girl. Thinkest thou my beloved's spirit hath descended from the heavens!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00090</h1>\n\n<p>That the secrets of her heart are thine to know!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00100</h1>\n\n<p>I have surrendered mine to her! Do you not see, my love? I am Shiva reborn!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00110</h1>\n\n<p>Gullible fool... The Light but illuminated the past for thee, it did not grant thee omniscience.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00120</h1>\n\n<p>The spirit thou hast summoned belongeth not to Shiva\u2500'tis but a shade conjured by thine own fancy.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00130</h1>\n\n<p>In an age long past, mine own kin were guilty of like folly. Beguiled by the dark ones' lies, they attempted to resurrect a king amongst wyrms\u2500yet the divinity they called forth merely borrowed the semblance of my fallen brood-brother.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00140</h1>\n\n<p>Such gods are not summoned, but created. Phantoms spun from the threads of misplaced faith.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00150</h1>\n\n<p>Then the spirit that answered me...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00160</h1>\n\n<p>...Was but thy dream of Shiva. Thy soul hath been corrupted by a deity of thine own making, child.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00170</h1>\n\n<p>Be that as it may, Lord Hraesvelgr, Ysayle's desire to heal the rift between man and dragon is real, and it has borne us this far.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00180</h1>\n\n<p>We would spare both our kind and yours the ravages of this senseless war! Pray join your voice to ours in a call for peace and forgiveness!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00190</h1>\n\n<p>The tale of thy kind is one of avarice, treachery, and death\u2500and thou wouldst speak to me of peace?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00200</h1>\n\n<p>Hark thee, mortal, to the naked truth...then tell me thou deservest forgiveness!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00010</h1>\n\n<p>Twelve hundred years ago, my beloved Shiva's sacrifice served to bring an end to the war 'twixt man and dragon, paving the way for an age of peace and cooperation.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00020</h1>\n\n<p>Two centuries of harmony were to follow, during which time the Elezen learned much about us, not least that the eyes of a great wyrm are the wellspring of his strength.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00030</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas out of the selfish desire to possess this strength that King Thordan then conspired to undo all that our peoples had achieved together.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00040</h1>\n\n<p>With the aid of his leal knights, that most noble of Elezen lured my brood-sister Ratatoskr into an ambush, and took from her that which he craved.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00050</h1>\n\n<p>Fain would I strike the image from my mind, yet still the scene doth linger\u2500of my brood-sister's tattered corpse, defiled by her Elezen allies. They had torn out her eyes, and feasted upon them in the manner of wild beasts.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00060</h1>\n\n<p>Yet that was not all, for from their bloody banquet, the fiends had gained strength beyond that of mortal men... Even now, I labor to comprehend the enormity of their betrayal.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00070</h1>\n\n<p>Nidhogg was the first to learn of the atrocity, and he took to the skies, hungry for vengeance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00080</h1>\n\n<p>But though he slew Thordan and some few of his knights, their fellow butchers knew only too well where to aim their spears, and with now-practiced savagery, they set about my brood-brother, sending him flailing from the field...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00090</h1>\n\n<p>Such is the truth the Holy See would keep hidden. Such was the beginning of the Dragonsong War.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00100</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis a song my kind shall ne'er forget, e'en should ten thousand years pass and Ishgard crumble into dust.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00010</h1>\n\n<p>Your tale bears scant resemblance to the one I was taught. How convenient that it should absolve your kind of all responsibility. But tell me, dragon: why should I believe your version of events?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00020</h1>\n\n<p>What thou choosest to believe is immaterial. The betrayal that yet haunts mine every waking moment is no less than the truth to my kind.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00030</h1>\n\n<p>And Nidhogg meaneth for Thordan's people to suffer for this sin till the end of days.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00040</h1>\n\n<p>That which thou imaginest a war of extinction is but a punishment\u2500a siege of the spirit. Hast thou not seen those who tire of the torment? Those who abandon their own and side with dragonkind?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00050</h1>\n\n<p>Ishgard's so-called heretics...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00060</h1>\n\n<p>Know that all the traitors' progeny bear a trace of Ratatoskr's essence. But a single sip of our blood is enough to awaken it...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00070</h1>\n\n<p>Then...the seed lies within us...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00080</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis for this reason that those who abandon their loyalties are rewarded with a drink. And thus are they transformed, to join the ranks of Nidhogg's ever-growing army as newborn dragons. One by one, through death or defection, my brood-brother shall account for all of the betrayers' children...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00090</h1>\n\n<p>Ye gods... I have borne witness to such a transformation! Looked on as a heretic assumed the shape of a dragon... I imagined it some manner of Dravanian enchantment!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00100</h1>\n\n<p>But if any Ishgardian, regardless of allegiance, has such potential within them... Twelve forgive us. To think of all the dragons we've slain...!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00110</h1>\n\n<p>There will always be some, of course, who choose to fight until the bitter end\u2500like thee, dragoon...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00120</h1>\n\n<p>But struggle as thou might, thy youthful vigor will be spent ere thou reachest two score and ten. And Nidhogg shall remain to torment thine offspring.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00130</h1>\n\n<p>Oft have I wondered why Nidhogg did not simply raze Ishgard to the ground.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00140</h1>\n\n<p>Now I have my answer. He has no intention of winning the Dragonsong War, for it is no war at all, but vengeance\u2500an eternal requiem sung for his murdered sister.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00150</h1>\n\n<p>Thou hast the right of it, dragonslayer. Comprehendest thou now the futility of thy quest?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00160</h1>\n\n<p>I have not come this far only to admit defeat. We can still return the Eye to Nidhogg, and beg forgiveness for our ancestors' crimes. Mayhap our words will sway him!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00170</h1>\n\n<p>Stubborn child... Thou thinkest in mortal terms. Our perception of time is too broad for thee to grasp.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00180</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis a simple matter for thee to offer thine apologies\u2500thou didst not perpetrate the crime. Despite thy visions, the deeds of history seem distant to thee.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00190</h1>\n\n<p>For a wyrm such as Nidhogg, however, that history is yet part of his present, as fresh as the blood that did gush from Ratatoskr's wounds. How could he not be driven mad?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00200</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis only by the calming embrace of Shiva's soul that mine own fury hath not consumed me.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>C00210</h1>\n\n<p>But let us speak no more of what is done. My faith in your kind is spent, and I would be alone.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00010</h1>\n\n<p>Well, what do you propose we do now? I, for one, am intent on continuing to the east...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00020</h1>\n\n<p>What is there to be found in the east?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00030</h1>\n\n<p>Nidhogg's lair\u2500the Aery\u2500is said to lie in that direction. And the Eye tells me he is near...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00040</h1>\n\n<p>You cannot still mean to slay him!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00050</h1>\n\n<p>You cannot still mean to stop me. I have been true to my word, and aided you in this fool's errand with Hraesvelgr.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00060</h1>\n\n<p>But your efforts at parley have come to naught, Lady Iceheart. I would see Ishgard saved, and for that, Nidhogg must die.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00070</h1>\n\n<p>With the tale of our ancestors' vile betrayal yet ringing in your ears, you speak of continuing this war?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00080</h1>\n\n<p>Nay, lady, I would but pierce its vengeful heart. When Nidhogg dies, this war shall die with him.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00090</h1>\n\n<p>A moment, Estinien. You yourself spoke of the great wyrm's strength\u2500that you believed him powerful enough to raze your city to the ground. How then are we few to challenge him?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00100</h1>\n\n<p>Even behind the stout walls of Ishgard\u2500with an army of knights manning the defenses\u2500our victory would be hard-won. Yet you propose to contend with the beast in his own lair?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00110</h1>\n\n<p>In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And if the tales are true, the Warrior of Light has bested many an invincible foe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00120</h1>\n\n<p>In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And with two Azure Dragoons working in unison, who can say what might be possible?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00130</h1>\n\n<p>But such speculation is meaningless if we cannot even find the wyrm. Our first task must be to seek out Nidhogg's lair.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00140</h1>\n\n<p>The story of this nation grows bloodier by the moment. Must death always be answered with more of the same?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00150</h1>\n\n<p>Such is the way of things, I fear. I shall consider it a miracle if mine armor is not stained crimson ere this conflict is ended.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00160</h1>\n\n<p>That I should be blinded by my own lies... Everything I believed... Everything I thought I was... Gone... All gone...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>D00170</h1>\n\n<p>Leave her. Your words will not reach her now. And we have not the time to wait for her to gather up the pieces of her shattered faith.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00010</h1>\n\n<p>Is that it?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00020</h1>\n\n<p>Aye... That would be the Aery. I feel Nidhogg's presence through the Eye\u2500his caustic hatred gnawing at my soul.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00030</h1>\n\n<p>'Twould seem the death of his consort has put him on guard. Mark how he wards his lair with tempestuous winds.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00040</h1>\n\n<p>A similar barrier once barred our entrance to the primal Garuda's domain...until we discovered the means by which it could be penetrated.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>E00050</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap it is time we called upon Master Garlond. 'Twill be just like the good old days, no?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00010</h1>\n\n<p>Feast your eyes upon our latest and greatest feat of engineering! We call it a \u201cmanacutter\u201d!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00020</h1>\n\n<p>After you put down Gaius, Wedge and me struck out on our own for a bit, and started work on the successor to the Tiny Bronco.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00030</h1>\n\n<p>Impressive little thing, isn't she? My talent for ship design has plainly rubbed off on them.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00040</h1>\n\n<p>They've adapted the principles of corrupted crystal technology, and constructed a mechanism which converts aether from its surroundings into elemental wind. Said wind is then harnessed by the specially engineered sails, providing the craft with propulsion and lift. All in all, a most elegant solution...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00050</h1>\n\n<p>...I'm actually a little upset that I didn't think of it myself.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00060</h1>\n\n<p>The design does, however, come with one small flaw...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00070</h1>\n\n<p>The energy conversion ratio's bloody awful. To generate enough power to get you off the ground, you need to be in an area awash with predominantly wind-aspected aether.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00080</h1>\n\n<p>In other words, there are a few places you can fly...and lots of places you can't.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00090</h1>\n\n<p>The new Ishgardian airship hasn't left the boys much time for tinkering\u2500meaning it may be a while before this particular project takes off, if you'll forgive the pun.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00100</h1>\n\n<p>Hah...hah...hah...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00110</h1>\n\n<p>Tataru, what's happened!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00120</h1>\n\n<p>I've been looking all over for you! There's been word from Ul'dah! It's about Her Grace, the sultana!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00130</h1>\n\n<p>It seems you're required elsewhere. Leave the manacutter with us. We'll see that she's airworthy and suitably equipped to slice through those winds.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>F00140</h1>\n\n<p>You, meanwhile, should concentrate on providing Raubahn and the sultana whatever help they need!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00010</h1>\n\n<p>Thank you for coming.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00020</h1>\n\n<p>No thanks are necessary, General. I trust your recuperation continues apace?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00030</h1>\n\n<p>I cannot complain. Thanks to Higiri and her ministrations, I've regained much of the strength I lost during my imprisonment.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00040</h1>\n\n<p>I gather you have made progress in the search for Her Grace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00050</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, some good fortune at last. A few days past, Dewlala informed us that a sizable shipment of alchemical supplies had been delivered to the palace.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00060</h1>\n\n<p>With Papashan's assistance, I set out to ascertain the source and nature of the shipment. My inquiries led me to Frondale's Phrontistery.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00070</h1>\n\n<p>There I learned that an order had been placed for a curious substance designed to sustain patients trapped in deathlike slumber\u2500an invention of the former head alchemist, apparently.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00080</h1>\n\n<p>A deathlike slumber...? This cannot be a coincidence!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00090</h1>\n\n<p>It lends some weight to Dewlala's claims, aye. Her Grace is likely somewhere within the palace\u2500abed but alive.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00100</h1>\n\n<p>Before making any attempt to extricate the sultana, however, it seemed prudent to learn what manner of substance was used to induce her torpor. To that end, I made inquiries as to the whereabouts of the one most like to have administered it\u2500the lady-in-waiting, Meriel.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00110</h1>\n\n<p>We sent for you as soon as we learned of her location. All that remains is to apprehend the woman.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00120</h1>\n\n<p>We shall find our cat's-paw in the Silver Bazaar.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00130</h1>\n\n<p>But we must tread carefully. The market is not the bustling place it once was, and someone is sure to mark our coming. Should they inform the Monetarists, we'll have a fight on our hands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00140</h1>\n\n<p>We must be prepared for the worst\u2500and being short an arm, I thought it wise to take another in its stead. What say you, Warrior of Light? Will you lend me yours?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>G00150</h1>\n\n<p>Then I pity the bastard that stands in our way. Come, my friends! For Nanamo...and for Ul'dah!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00010</h1>\n\n<p>You are Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00020</h1>\n\n<p>I know no one of that name! Pray excuse me...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00030</h1>\n\n<p>General Aldynn!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00040</h1>\n\n<p>We will have the truth from you, girl...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00050</h1>\n\n<p>Mayhap 'twould be better coming from me.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00060</h1>\n\n<p>Lolorito... You'd best talk fast.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00070</h1>\n\n<p>As you know, Teledji Adeledji's Carteneau Reclamation Bill was no more than a facade\u2500a means to get his grubby little hands on that Allagan monstrosity, Omega.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00080</h1>\n\n<p>When he learned of Nanamo's intention to abdicate, however, he was forced to amend his plans. Suddenly, assassination seemed the most promising way to further his ambitions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00090</h1>\n\n<p>I am told Teledji had discovered a maid in whose veins ran the blood of House Thorne\u2500a new, more pliable puppet to sit the throne. 'Twould have caused an uproar, of course, but few could have contested her claim.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00100</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas plain that Teledji's wild machinations had outgrown our ability to control them. So I decided to usurp his scheme, and left the fool to seal his own demise.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00110</h1>\n\n<p>And what of Nanamo?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00120</h1>\n\n<p>Oh, I have no desire to harm Her Grace\u2500'twould profit me little to destabilize our government. Thus did I employ young Meriel here to administer a potent sleeping potion in place of a poison.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00130</h1>\n\n<p>You should know, General, that your dear friend Ilberd was fully aware of my plan.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00140</h1>\n\n<p>I had him lie about the assassination as a means to prime your rage against Teledji. We weren't entirely sure how you would react, but things went rather better than expected.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00150</h1>\n\n<p>You conniving little worm... You had your claws in the Crystal Braves before their first recruit had sworn to serve!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00160</h1>\n\n<p>But of course. When a new game begins, 'tis only prudent to have a piece on the board. Ilberd was mine.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00170</h1>\n\n<p>Truth be told, a significant proportion of the Braves' initial endowment was also mine. With such large sums moving about, 'twas a rather trifling matter to disguise my own contribution.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00180</h1>\n\n<p>Ah, Ilberd... I secured his services with a promise to support his cause once my authority had been solidified. I swear, the man thinks of naught but prising Ala Mhigo from the grasp of the Empire.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00190</h1>\n\n<p>Unlike you, General, the poor fellow seems quite unable to forsake the land of his forefathers. Mayhap that's why he called you a traitor to your people and a disgrace to your homeland...amongst other things. What was it he always compared you to? Oh, yes! \u201cAn overgrown lapdog, begging for scraps at the sultana's table!\u201d Oh, how we laughed...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00200</h1>\n\n<p>Alas, Ilberd's entertaining little outbursts eventually gave way to wearisome tirades, and the zealous brute became rather unruly. I had no wish to see you executed, you understand, but he would not take no for an answer. Rest assured, his employment with me has long since ended.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00210</h1>\n\n<p>...Which brings us neatly to the present. What say you, General? Both you and the sultana are alive; we have one corpse and one fugitive; and preparations have been made to restore your good name. Shall we cry quits and start again with a blank ledger? Hm?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00220</h1>\n\n<p>The hells we will! Do you honestly expect me to forgive and forget? After all you've done!? You're guilty of high treason!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00230</h1>\n\n<p>Stay your blade, Master Aldynn! You yourself are not innocent! Or have you forgotten your own crime in executing Teledji Adeledji without trial!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00240</h1>\n\n<p>Though you acted out of loyalty to the sultana, such deeds are in violation of both the word and spirit of the law!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00250</h1>\n\n<p>...If you would, Lord Lolorito?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00260</h1>\n\n<p>This potion will wake the sultana from her slumber. Consider it a gesture of conciliation.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00270</h1>\n\n<p>You will find Her Grace resting comfortably within her private chambers. Should you doubt my word, I shall willingly accompany you to the palace as your hostage.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00280</h1>\n\n<p>I like not your motives, Lolorito...but you saved the sultana's life, and for that you have my gratitude.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>H00290</h1>\n\n<p>Raubahn Aldynn, you are hereby reinstated as general of the Immortal Flames! The citizens of Ul'dah shall once more be united under Nanamo Ul Namo, and together we shall usher in a new age of prosperity!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00010</h1>\n\n<p>Ugh...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00020</h1>\n\n<p>I was having the longest dream...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>I00030</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis time to wake up, Your Grace. Another day begins in Thanalan, and the sun blazes bright upon the sands.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00010</h1>\n\n<p>Her Grace is awoken. The palace physician assures me she is none the worse for her slumber.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00020</h1>\n\n<p>I believe Her Grace will soon resume her plans to place the government of Ul'dah into the hands of its citizens.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00030</h1>\n\n<p>Whatever path she chooses to take, I shall walk it with her. And we shall tread slowly, lest the nation be unsettled in our wake.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00040</h1>\n\n<p>Her Grace's compassion is a shining beacon to us all...but what our city truly thrives upon is competition.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00050</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis in the struggle against our rivals that opportunities are seized and fortunes made. And with the Empire on the offensive once more, now would hardly seem the time to turn our system of government upon its head.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00060</h1>\n\n<p>Are you privy to new intelligence, my lord?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00070</h1>\n\n<p>I would hardly call it new. Remind me: what was the name of that enormous imperial warship which met its end in Mor Dhona? Wait, I have it! The Agrius. Yes, well, 'twould appear that the Garleans have been hard at work on another such vessel.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00080</h1>\n\n<p>How close are they to completing this ship!? Is it operational!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00090</h1>\n\n<p>Its maiden flight was a success, I hear. I should imagine Emperor Varis is eager to see how it performs in battle.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>J00100</h1>\n\n<p>My lords and ladies, I move that it is time to repair the damage caused by Teledji Adeledji, and prepare our great nation to repel the Empire once more.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00010</h1>\n\n<p>'Tis well that the sultana has awoken. The Syndicate yet needs to put its house in order, but 'twould seem the worst of the confusion has passed.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00020</h1>\n\n<p>Ul'dah has taken control of its future...and I must do the same.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00030</h1>\n\n<p>I have decided to disband the Crystal Braves.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00040</h1>\n\n<p>Among the recruits, there were those who supported our order's goals and convictions with all sincerity. 'Tis my hope that these loyal men and women will choose to remain our allies in the battles to come.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00050</h1>\n\n<p>As for those who sided with the traitor, Ilberd, they shall be hunted down and held to account for their crimes. It is my earnest hope that they will surrender themselves peaceably when the time comes...though I think it unlikely.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00060</h1>\n\n<p>Ah, my all-conquering Crystal Braves... The model army meant to pave the way for a single, unified Grand Company of Eorzea. That so high an ideal should be brought so low...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00070</h1>\n\n<p>I need not tell you how deeply the betrayal stung me. Yet I see now that it was mine own naivety and pride which allowed the Braves to fall prey to corruption.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00080</h1>\n\n<p>As ever, it is to your own shining example that I turn for inspiration. Like you, I mean to stand firm in the face of hardship, and give mine all for the cause.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00090</h1>\n\n<p>Let us resume the search for our missing comrades, that we might come together to shine the light of dawn across the realm once more.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>K00100</h1>\n\n<p>The role of Crystal Brave commander suited me ill, and I shall play it no longer. Henceforth, I shall be no more or less than Alphinaud, proud member of the Scions.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00010</h1>\n\n<p>All stands ready, Lord Commander.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00020</h1>\n\n<p>Ah, the moment has come, then?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00030</h1>\n\n<p>Pray excuse my lateness. I paid a brief visit to the workshop to inquire about the manacutters. The engineers assure me that they are ready.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00040</h1>\n\n<p>The Aery is now but a short flight away. Yet what a long and winding path we took to reach this point.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00050</h1>\n\n<p>Were it not for Master Alphinaud's proposal, we never would have attempted to parley with the dragons.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00060</h1>\n\n<p>Though our negotiations yielded little, our expedition with Lady Iceheart taught us much.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00070</h1>\n\n<p>You took an unimaginable risk... I could scarce believe the tale Estinien told.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00080</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, 'tis true that many of our countrymen would sooner die than join hands with the heretics' mistress, but 'twas through that most unlikely of alliances that we came to speak with Hraesvelgr.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00090</h1>\n\n<p>A conversation that went rather poorly, as I recall.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00100</h1>\n\n<p>In this instance, the journey was more important than the destination. Had we not slain Nidhogg's consort, Tioman, and put the great wyrm on his guard, the Dravanians would have arrived at Ishgard's walls long ago.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00110</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, that they would. Full grateful am I for every hour of respite your actions have afforded us. Thanks to you, our defenses are much improved. 'Tis but a pity they won't be enough.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00120</h1>\n\n<p>Thus you believe an assault upon the Aery represents the city's best chance of survival. Is that not so, Estinien?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00130</h1>\n\n<p>I am under no illusions. Nidhogg's might is legendary. But with his eye in my possession, I can stifle his strength at the source.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00140</h1>\n\n<p>Victory will be hard-won, even so, and I shall be glad indeed to have the Warrior of Light at my side.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00150</h1>\n\n<p>You shall have my blade as well. There are more of these \u201cmanacutters\u201d to be had, yes?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00160</h1>\n\n<p>(-Lucia-)Lord Commander, no!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00170</h1>\n\n<p>How can I, a proud knight of Ishgard, stand by and do naught while an outsider risks life and limb for our homeland? I swore an oath to protect this city!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00180</h1>\n\n<p>Pray leave the slaying of dragons to dragoons, ser knight. Your duty to command the city's defense is no less vital.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00190</h1>\n\n<p>Should we fail, and Nidhogg slip through our grasp, who, then, will hold the walls against him? Will you leave Ishgard in the hands of the Holy See's zealots?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00200</h1>\n\n<p>There are others\u2500</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00210</h1>\n\n<p>Who but you has the authority and the standing to orchestrate a citywide defense? I do not, and neither does the Warrior of Light. That is why it is our place to fight, and yours to remain here, Lord Commander.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00220</h1>\n\n<p>What, you too, Master Alphinaud? By the Fury... You have shown some promise, but this adversary is far beyond your skills.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00230</h1>\n\n<p>Your candor is appreciated, ser dragoon. I shall remain, then, and cheer you from afar.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>L00240</h1>\n\n<p>Well, my friend, 'twould seem I have discouraged the last of the volunteers, and claimed the task as ours alone. But if any alive can best this wyrm, 'tis surely we two!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>M00010</h1>\n\n<p>We're through!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>M00020</h1>\n\n<p>So, this is the Aery! Where are you Nidhogg!? You have guests!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>M00030</h1>\n\n<p>There!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>M00040</h1>\n\n<p>Greetings, Lord of Dravania! I believe we have something that belongs to you!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>M00050</h1>\n\n<p>Wicked mortals! I shall melt your flesh, and turn your bones to ash!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00010</h1>\n\n<p>Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00020</h1>\n\n<p>I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00030</h1>\n\n<p>No, wyrm! This ends here!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>N00040</h1>\n\n<p>You gifted my people a thousand years of suffering. Now I gift you an eternity in darkness!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00010</h1>\n\n<p>They are ours, Lord Haldrath... The eyes of Nidhogg!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00020</h1>\n\n<p>Aye... The wyrm lies broken and my father is avenged. With the wellspring of his vitality thus denied him, Nidhogg shall not linger long in this world.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00030</h1>\n\n<p>But behold the terrible price we have paid. My sire is dead; so many brother knights slain.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00040</h1>\n\n<p>We traded our honor for the strength which now courses in our veins. And still we are forced to make such sacrifice.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00050</h1>\n\n<p>But not in vain, my lord. Hraesvelgr is the only great wyrm left in Dravania, and he dares not leave his lair.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00060</h1>\n\n<p>With Nidhogg's eyes in your possession, who now can challenge the might of Ishgard? Ascend the throne, and take your rightful place as the ruler of our people!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00070</h1>\n\n<p>Nay, my friend, I must forsake the mantle of king. Though Nidhogg be defeated, his wyrmling horde yet darkens the skies with wings beyond counting.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00080</h1>\n\n<p>As one who partook of Ratatoskr's strength, it shall be my penance to bear a knight's arms until death grants me leave to retire. When that day comes, no prince shall perish, but a hells-bound hunter of dragons...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00090</h1>\n\n<p>But Lord Haldrath! What then shall become of the royal line!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00100</h1>\n\n<p>Think of your people, my lord! Without a king, who will the common man turn to in his hour of need? How will he find his way without your benevolent hand to guide him?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00110</h1>\n\n<p>I thank you, Ser Flavien and Ser Sylvetrel\u2500for dispelling my remaining doubts. With men of such wisdom and compassion in service to the realm, 'tis plain that Ishgard has no need of a king.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00120</h1>\n\n<p>But if you must bow to the demands of tradition, you need look no further than yourselves for one worthy to wear the crown.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00130</h1>\n\n<p>Fare thee well, my brother knights...my loyal friends. On these shoulders shall I bear the weight of my father's sins; with this lance shall I repay the debt accrued through our misdeeds.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00140</h1>\n\n<p>What cruel jest has fate played upon us...? Have we seized this desperate victory only to lose a king?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00150</h1>\n\n<p>We can but act as our lord has bid. We few who remain must divide between us the rulership of Ishgard and her people.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00160</h1>\n\n<p>Not I. My oath was to Lord Haldrath, and he alone. If he is not to be king, then I would hang up my shield, as well.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00170</h1>\n\n<p>Will you abandon us, too, ser?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00180</h1>\n\n<p>I would wash my hands of blood and betrayal and take up an honest trade. Mayhap I shall serve ale instead of sharpened steel...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00190</h1>\n\n<p>We four, then...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00200</h1>\n\n<p>Fortemps, Haillenarte, Durendaire, and Dzemael...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00210</h1>\n\n<p>But four houses to rule all of Ishgard...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00220</h1>\n\n<p>...And what of the throne?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00230</h1>\n\n<p>We keep it empty. Until the day a king rises once more, we must assume the role of stewards.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>O00240</h1>\n\n<p>We shall shape our nation anew with a history of our own making\u2500and let the truth of this dark day die here, upon the battlefield.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00010</h1>\n\n<p>What ails you, friend!? Are you wounded?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00020</h1>\n\n<p>You have borne witness to history...to the culmination of the first battle with Nidhogg.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00030</h1>\n\n<p>The legend of Ishgard's founding tells that our ancestors were led to the land of Coerthas by the valiant King Thordan.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00040</h1>\n\n<p>In the midst of their journey, they came to a wide chasm, where they were set upon by a great wyrm\u2500Nidhogg. A furious battle then ensued, with Thordan leading the van.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00050</h1>\n\n<p>Though the brave king was slain defending his people, his son, Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon, fought on undaunted...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00060</h1>\n\n<p>And with a mighty thrust of his lance, he gouged out Nidhogg's eye, forcing the wicked creature into retreat.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00070</h1>\n\n<p>Thus did this eldritch orb become a sacred treasure of Ishgard, lending its power to every knight deemed worthy to bear the title of Azure Dragoon.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00080</h1>\n\n<p>A rousing tale, is it not? Would that I could still believe it. But your vision, which we must accept as immutable truth, leaves no room for doubt\u2500save on one point.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00090</h1>\n\n<p>If Haldrath took both of Nidhogg's eyes, then how came this eye to be lodged in the wyrm's skull?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>P00100</h1>\n\n<p>Beneath every answer we unearth, another question lies buried...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>Q00010</h1>\n\n<p>'Twas a fierce battle, but one I knew we would win. Your fame is well deserved, Warrior of Light. Full proud am I to have fought at your side.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>Q00020</h1>\n\n<p>I would fain return with all swiftness to Ishgard to inform the lord commander of our triumph...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>Q00030</h1>\n\n<p>But we must first have words with Hraesvelgr. There are parts of this tale that the wyrm has kept from us, and I would know wherefore...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>R00010</h1>\n\n<p>Impenitent mortals, ever seeking to bury old wrongs under new.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>R00020</h1>\n\n<p>I did sense the moment of Nidhogg's demise...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>R00030</h1>\n\n<p>You mean the moment I prised your eye from his head?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>R00040</h1>\n\n<p>'Twould seem thou hast uncovered my secret. Aye. Unto the blinded Nidhogg did I yield one half of my strength...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00010</h1>\n\n<p>Nidhogg... What hath befallen thee?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00020</h1>\n\n<p>We are undone by covetous mortals.

What madness hath unmade our peaceful accord!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00040</h1>\n\n<p>Did I not warn thee, brood-brother? They have ever been untrustworthy creatures, these short-lived Elezen.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00050</h1>\n\n<p>But thou wert enchanted by thy mortal maid. Thy folly hath cost Ratatoskr her life, and me mine eyes...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00060</h1>\n\n<p>Oh, my beloved Shiva... How swiftly are thy kin made bestial by their appetites.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00070</h1>\n\n<p>Hraesvelgr. 'Twas thy blindness that did invite disaster into our lands. Surrender thee an eye to me, and let that be thy penance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00080</h1>\n\n<p>Nidhogg...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00090</h1>\n\n<p>They bested me once, but I was reckless. I shall need but a single eye to inflict enduring torment upon these traitors and every child of their line!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00100</h1>\n\n<p>Yield to me thy strength, brood-brother!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>S00110</h1>\n\n<p>My vengeance is begun!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00010</h1>\n\n<p>Thou hast borne witness to a scene from my past.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00020</h1>\n\n<p>It was yours... Your strength that sustained Nidhogg all these years...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00030</h1>\n\n<p>Would that Haldrath had dealt the wyrm a killing blow...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00040</h1>\n\n<p>When my brood-brother did appear before me, bloody and blinded, his life was all but spent. He demanded half my vigor, that he might exact his revenge upon the mortals who had wronged us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00050</h1>\n\n<p>And so you acquiesced! You surrendered your eye to Nidhogg knowing full well the suffering he would inflict!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00060</h1>\n\n<p>The peace my beloved so dearly desired had been shattered by her own kin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00070</h1>\n\n<p>Their treachery claimed my brood-sister's life and my brood-brother's reason! Thinkest thou thy fits of indignation will move me to remorse!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00080</h1>\n\n<p>Go, mortals! Take your unruly passions and leave this place... Your presence here spelleth naught but misery.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>T00090</h1>\n\n<p>Were it not for Shiva's soothing embrace, I would slay you where you stand.

    "text_clean": "000020 But what other choice do we have? It's not like we can talk it over with them. Dragons and men aren't exactly on speaking terms. 000030 ...With certain notable exceptions. 000040 You don't mean...Iceheart!? 000050 When last you spoke with her, she lamented her crimes, did she not? 000060 Then there remains a sliver of hope. If we can persuade Iceheart to act as our intermediary, we may yet be able to convince Nidhogg to abandon his bloody course. 000070 If there is to be a meeting, I would accompany you. 000080 ...Estinien!? 000090 Even with your intermediary, Nidhogg's bloodrage may render him deaf to reason. However, the mere attempt may afford our forces precious time to prepare.  000100 Of course...you might also consider a more direct approach to ending this conflict. With the power of the Eye at my disposal, and the vaunted strength of the Warrior of Light, we could conceivably slay the beast outright... 000110 If we are to risk a face-to-face meeting with the dread wyrm, I for one would feel safer in the company of the Azure Dragoon. However, I should only turn to your lance if my words failed to find their mark. Is that clear? 000120 Perfectly. I shall assume that Iceheart enjoys similar diplomatic protection until instructed otherwise. 000130 A word of advice: think carefully before divulging the particulars of this plan to Ser Aymeric. 'Twould not do to have the lord commander accused of consorting with heretics. 000140 Indeed. I thank you for your counsel, Estinien. We shall be honored to have you with us. 000150 I am glad to be of service. 100010 I want the defenses of the outer ward rechecked. See to it that the ballistas are in good repair and supplied with enough ammunition for a prolonged siege. 100020 At once, my lord! 100030 Ah, 'twould seem I have visitors and unlike those massing beyond our walls, these ones are welcome. 100040 Pray forgive us for interrupting you in the midst of your preparations, Ser Aymeric, but our suit concerns the impending assault. To speak plain, we believe there is a chance the invasion might be halted before it even begins. 100050 I can divulge little more at this time, but I must nevertheless request that you advise the Holy See to refrain from launching any preemptive sorties whilst we seek to put our plans in motion. 100060 I will gladly lend my support to any endeavor that could spare the blood of my countrymen but I would know more of the cause you would have me champion. Will you not share aught of this mysterious undertaking? 100070 Know that I have offered my lance to aid in this endeavor. I cannot claim that its success is assured, but our actions should serve to delay Nidhogg's advance at the very least. 100080 Which is more than can be said for the ill-conceived counterattack advocated by the See's more vocal crusaders. They offer glorious death, but little hope of victory. 100090 Aye...their proposal does not inspire confidence. Our resources should rightly be spent shoring up the city's defenses. 100100 Hmmm. The Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light, sallying forth together to face the dread wyrm, Nidhogg... 100110 I must admit, the mere thought of it does much to dispel my misgivings. Go, then carry out your plan. I shall do what I can for you within the Holy See. 200010 Such commotion... 200020 Yes, Your Eminence. The bells of the Observatorium warn of our enemy's approach... 200030 So...the dragons are coming. 200040 Let them come in their hundreds and their thousands. With the divine blade in our hands, we shall rend their flesh and drown the heretics in their masters' blood. Even Nidhogg and his foul brood shall be powerless to resist us. 200050 And when we have rid the world of their pestilence, we shall turn our attention to our Ascian allies see that they are suitably rewarded for their invaluable assistance. 200060 If I may, Your Eminence. The Paragons wield powers strange and unknowable. Can we be certain that they will not see through our deception? 200070 We can be certain of naught save the righteousness of our cause. If you would be a true leader of men, you must possess conviction as well as caution. 200080 We seek to excise the root of an evil that has blighted us for a thousand years. The risk is worth the reward. 200090 And what of Estinien and this Warrior of Light? They have plans of their own... 200100 Leave them to their purpose. We must each play the role we have been given...you and your chosen brothers most of all. 200110 For the glory of King Thordan... 300010 (-Iceheart-)Ah, I should have known it would be you... 300020 (-Iceheart-)Word reached me of a struggle with a small but well-armed band of trespassers. Forgive my comrades their hostility few come here uninvited, and fewer still with good intent. 300030 (-Iceheart-)Now, tell me why you are here. Q1 What will you say to Lady Iceheart? A1 We wish to stop Nidhogg's attack on Ishgard. We wished to speak with you. It's a long story... 300040 (-Iceheart-)So, you seek to stem the Dravanian tide with talk? A romantic notion. 300050 (-Iceheart-)If you but knew the truth the spark which lit the flames of this animosity you would understand the futility of your quest. 300060 (-Iceheart-)Shall I relate it to you? The sordid history my gift has shown me? That which the Holy See has taken such pains to suppress? 400010 (-Iceheart-)'Twas more than a millennium past when an Elezen tribe first sought to claim the lands of Coerthas as its home. 400020 (-Iceheart-)Unfortunately for them, Coerthas was already home to dragonkind, and they were not inclined to make way for the invaders. Thus did a bloody war begin a war which might well have rumbled on until one or the other side was exterminated, had it not been for the resolve of a single woman. That woman's name was  Shiva.  400030 (-Iceheart-)While those around her fought and died, she attempted to parley with the dragons, and in so doing discovered them to be possessed of profound intelligence and reason. The great wyrm Hraesvelgr in particular so enchanted Shiva that she found herself growing to love the creature, whom her people considered a monster. 400040 (-Iceheart-)In the eyes of a near-immortal dragon, however, the fleeting life of an Elezen is as that of a freshly cut rose scarce has the flower bloomed before it begins to fade and wither. 400050 (-Iceheart-)Such melancholy musings plagued Hraesvelgr, who had found in Shiva an unexpected and beloved soulmate. He knew that all too soon, death would snatch her away from him. 400060 (-Iceheart-)Unable to bear the thought of their separation, the maid bid the wyrm consume her, that their spirits might be entwined for eternity. 400070 (-Iceheart-)...Though loath to perform the deed, Hraesvelgr ultimately gave in to her plea, and soon thereafter, the tale of their ill-fated love spread throughout the two warring factions. No more could they raise blade or claw against one another, knowing that the souls of their kin were so inextricably bound. 400080 (-Iceheart-)In the days that followed, man and dragon learned to live in harmony, and together built a nation unlike any the world had ever known. For two hundred years did this blissful age of peace continue, as it would to this day, had vilest envy not stirred in the hearts of the Elezen. 400090 (-Iceheart-)It is said that wyrms owe their longevity to the boundless reserves of vitality found within their eyes and 'twas in this belief that a traitorous band of knights deceived their allies of some two centuries, and took by force that which they coveted... 500010 (-Iceheart-)Nidhogg he who now stands poised to unleash his wyrmlings upon Ishgard was the great dragon who lost an eye to Elezen treachery. 500020 (-Iceheart-)And until he prises it from the hands of the traitors' progeny, no amount of conciliatory words will stay his fury. 500030 You are wrong, Lady Iceheart. 500040 Lest you misunderstand, I do not doubt your vision of the past 'tis true that Nidhogg greatly desired to reclaim the Eye. 500050 Indeed, it was for that very reason that I kept it with me as I roamed the land, attempting to draw him away from the city. 500060 Good gods... 500070 Until recently, Nidhogg seemed unable to resist its allure, and pursued me relentlessly. Needless to say, that is no longer the case. Now, it would seem he has fixed his attention on Ishgard itself, though he knows full well the Eye does not reside there. 500080 (-Iceheart-)You believe he targets the capital for another reason...? 500090 I believe reason has all but left him. Through the Eye, I feel much of what Nidhogg feels, and the dragon's thirst for vengeance will not be quenched by aught less than a sea of blood. 500100 If Nidhogg is indeed lost to reason, might we not seek an audience with Hraesvelgr instead? 500110 He has thus far shown no inclination to aid in the invasion of Ishgard, and may yet welcome our efforts to broker a peace. 500120 (-Iceheart-)You still believe that a peaceable solution can be found? Very well. I will take you to him. 500130 (-Iceheart-)Our road will lead us to Dravania, the homeland of dragonkind. There we shall ascend unto the clouds, where Hraesvelgr resides... 600010 Is aught amiss, my friend? 600020 I sense the many battles are beginning to take their toll. Rest awhile. And should you lose sight of us Dravania lies beyond the mountains to the west. 600030 Curious... The vestiges of thy mistress's blessing are not as faint as once they were... 600040 Thy will to succeed grants thee unusual fortitude. But will it be enough...? 700010 Beyond Abalathia's Spine the great mountain range that spans the continent of Aldenard from east to west... 700020 Into the deepening shadows of Sohm Al, where lies the ancient home of dragonkind... 700030 To a land where the soil slithers, and the skies seethe with sinuous shapes, they came. 800010 Vidofnir! 800020 Ah, 'tis thee, Little One. From above, I did mistake thee for a Gnath. 'Tis well I chanced to look again, or thou wouldst now be ash. 800030 Dear Vidofnir...how I have missed you. Would that I had come sooner...and not out of dire necessity. 800040 Thou art troubled. Speak, that I might know thy plight. 800050 Thou wouldst have Father admonish his brood-brother? 800060 I would end this war without further bloodshed. 800070 How am I to believe thee, Little One...when thine own companion beareth Nidhogg's stolen eye!? 800080 Have care, dragon...or I shall gouge out one of yours. 800090 You forget yourself, ser! We are here on a mission of peace! 800100 My sire's will forbiddeth me from inviting discord to our home... 'Tis for this reason, and no other, that thou still drawest breath, knight. 800110 Vidofnir, please we must be allowed to convey our intentions to Hraesvelgr in person, with words of our own choosing. 800120 Grant us this favor, and open the way to Sohm Al! 800130 Thou hast ever been welcome, Little One. 800140 ...But I cannot grant thy wish. I am bound to remain here, and protect my kin from the Gnath's god. 800150 The Gnath have summoned a primal!? 800160 Pray excuse my forwardness, but if we were to eliminate the threat to your territory, would you consent to Lady Ysayle's request? 800170 Ha! Dost thou imagine thyself equal to the task to succeed where dragons have failed? 800180 'Tis beyond thee, mortal. But thou art welcome to try, nonetheless. Only know that idle promises shall avail thee naught! 800190 It would seem we have no choice but to make good on Alphinaud's offer. Why must our every bid for peace breed yet more war? 810010 Now we have but to wait... 810020 O Lord Ravana! Master of the Sacred Blades! Wrath of the Colony! Conqueror of the World! Hear our prayer! 810030 Pray grant unto Your devoted children the gift of Your divine presence! 810040 He comes! 810050 All strength to the colony. Speak and I shall listen! 810060 O Glorious General! We have captured intruders, and would make unto You an offering of their life's blood... 810070 These feeble fleshlings dared to invade Gnath lands? 810080 Hear me, Lord Ravana! My companion and I did not come to contest your children's territory. 810090 We wished only to learn the reason you wage war against the dragons. 810100 Thou wouldst flirt with death merely to satisfy thy curiosity? Wherefore should the glorious conquests of the Gnath concern thee so, Elezen? 810110 ...Ahhh, mayhap thine own kind's struggle against the wyrms fareth poorly, and thou art desirous of a pact. 810120 We crave no alliance, Lord Ravana only peace. We would bring an end to our war with the dragons. Yet so long as they remain embroiled in this conflict with your children, our goal shall remain out of reach. 810130 Never before have the Gnath risen up in such numbers, and never yet with you at their head. Why do you lead them to war? 810140 Thy question hath no meaning. To live is but to fight. 810150 Long have my children waited, gathering their strength in the shadow of thy ceaseless conflict. 810160 The Gnath would see the Dravanians slain, and their territory secured and by such fervent prayers am I now given form and purpose. 810170 As I feared, your very existence is an obstacle to our goal. Since you are so fond of fighting, we challenge you, Lord of the Gnath! 810180 And should we emerge the victors, I would have you swear to withdraw your soldiers from Dravanian soil! 810190 Gahahaha! Thou art bold indeed to risk thy fleshy hide so readily! 810200 Very well. I, Ravana, fourfold master of the blade, do accept thy challenge! 810210 But should I emerge the victor, I would have thee swear to serve in mine army till thy last breath is spent! Do you accept!? 810220 I do! And I believe the first bout is mine! 810230 What is this!? A god clad in flesh!? 810240 Is aught amiss, my lord? Thou wilt not break thy word, I trust. 810250 Mine oath is unbending as steel, little goddess! Thy ruse will but add to mine enjoyment! 810260 I thought myself...stronger... Mayhap with more crystals...? 810270 Be thou god or maid, thou art nothing to me! ...And what of thee, mortal? Art thou warrior or craven? 810280 A warrior, then! Good! Mayhap thou wilt provide more sport than thy feeble companion! 820010 Thus doth the sacred rite of combat proclaim the victor... I lay my blades at thy feet, child of man... 820020 You do not disappoint, Warrior of Light. Would that I had your skill in battle. ...I do begin to see why so many place their faith in you. 820030 For all his savagery, I do not think Ravana one to break his word. Provided the dragons do not trespass upon Gnath lands, they should have little to fear of the primal's biting blades. We have done well, have we not? Come, let us return to Vidofnir and share these glad tidings. 820040 Once more you achieve the impossible, Bringer of Light... But with every mortal heart that succumbs to fear and fury, another voice is joined to the chorus beseeching divine succor. 820050 At their bidding, warring gods will shake the firmament, and your world will be consumed in the swelling storm of chaos... 900010 To the peak of Sohm Al, at the end of a perilous mountain path... 900020 Whence could be seen a string of pearl-like islands, floating impossibly atop a sea of clouds. 900030 To a domain where dragons and men had once lived in harmony, whose majesty no mortal eye had glimpsed for nigh on a thousand years, they came. A00010 Mortals... Why do you disturb my solitude? A00020 Hraesvelgr... A00030 Thou speakest the name of a creature that but awaiteth the release of oblivion. Leave me... A00031 By the Twelve... Mine ears hear the tongue of dragons, yet the meaning rings clear within my mind... How can that be...? A00040 Hraesvelgr...do you not remember me? 'Twas I whom you found in Dravania I who glimpsed the truth. A00050 The truth about your past, about Shiva  A00060 Do not speak her name, mortal! A00070 But speak it I must! I have summoned Shiva's soul from the beyond, and offered myself as her vessel! She has made her heart known to me! A00080 Foolish girl. Thinkest thou my beloved's spirit hath descended from the heavens!? A00090 That the secrets of her heart are thine to know!? A00100 I have surrendered mine to her! Do you not see, my love? I am Shiva reborn! A00110 Gullible fool... The Light but illuminated the past for thee, it did not grant thee omniscience. A00120 The spirit thou hast summoned belongeth not to Shiva 'tis but a shade conjured by thine own fancy. A00130 In an age long past, mine own kin were guilty of like folly. Beguiled by the dark ones' lies, they attempted to resurrect a king amongst wyrms yet the divinity they called forth merely borrowed the semblance of my fallen brood-brother. A00140 Such gods are not summoned, but created. Phantoms spun from the threads of misplaced faith. A00150 Then the spirit that answered me... A00160 ...Was but thy dream of Shiva. Thy soul hath been corrupted by a deity of thine own making, child. A00170 Be that as it may, Lord Hraesvelgr, Ysayle's desire to heal the rift between man and dragon is real, and it has borne us this far. A00180 We would spare both our kind and yours the ravages of this senseless war! Pray join your voice to ours in a call for peace and forgiveness! A00190 The tale of thy kind is one of avarice, treachery, and death and thou wouldst speak to me of peace? A00200 Hark thee, mortal, to the naked truth...then tell me thou deservest forgiveness! B00010 Twelve hundred years ago, my beloved Shiva's sacrifice served to bring an end to the war 'twixt man and dragon, paving the way for an age of peace and cooperation. B00020 Two centuries of harmony were to follow, during which time the Elezen learned much about us, not least that the eyes of a great wyrm are the wellspring of his strength. B00030 'Twas out of the selfish desire to possess this strength that King Thordan then conspired to undo all that our peoples had achieved together. B00040 With the aid of his leal knights, that most noble of Elezen lured my brood-sister Ratatoskr into an ambush, and took from her that which he craved. B00050 Fain would I strike the image from my mind, yet still the scene doth linger of my brood-sister's tattered corpse, defiled by her Elezen allies. They had torn out her eyes, and feasted upon them in the manner of wild beasts. B00060 Yet that was not all, for from their bloody banquet, the fiends had gained strength beyond that of mortal men... Even now, I labor to comprehend the enormity of their betrayal. B00070 Nidhogg was the first to learn of the atrocity, and he took to the skies, hungry for vengeance. B00080 But though he slew Thordan and some few of his knights, their fellow butchers knew only too well where to aim their spears, and with now-practiced savagery, they set about my brood-brother, sending him flailing from the field... B00090 Such is the truth the Holy See would keep hidden. Such was the beginning of the Dragonsong War. B00100 'Tis a song my kind shall ne'er forget, e'en should ten thousand years pass and Ishgard crumble into dust. C00010 Your tale bears scant resemblance to the one I was taught. How convenient that it should absolve your kind of all responsibility. But tell me, dragon: why should I believe your version of events? C00020 What thou choosest to believe is immaterial. The betrayal that yet haunts mine every waking moment is no less than the truth to my kind. C00030 And Nidhogg meaneth for Thordan's people to suffer for this sin till the end of days. C00040 That which thou imaginest a war of extinction is but a punishment a siege of the spirit. Hast thou not seen those who tire of the torment? Those who abandon their own and side with dragonkind? C00050 Ishgard's so-called heretics... C00060 Know that all the traitors' progeny bear a trace of Ratatoskr's essence. But a single sip of our blood is enough to awaken it... C00070 Then...the seed lies within us...? C00080 'Tis for this reason that those who abandon their loyalties are rewarded with a drink. And thus are they transformed, to join the ranks of Nidhogg's ever-growing army as newborn dragons. One by one, through death or defection, my brood-brother shall account for all of the betrayers' children... C00090 Ye gods... I have borne witness to such a transformation! Looked on as a heretic assumed the shape of a dragon... I imagined it some manner of Dravanian enchantment! C00100 But if any Ishgardian, regardless of allegiance, has such potential within them... Twelve forgive us. To think of all the dragons we've slain...! C00110 There will always be some, of course, who choose to fight until the bitter end like thee, dragoon... C00120 But struggle as thou might, thy youthful vigor will be spent ere thou reachest two score and ten. And Nidhogg shall remain to torment thine offspring. C00130 Oft have I wondered why Nidhogg did not simply raze Ishgard to the ground. C00140 Now I have my answer. He has no intention of winning the Dragonsong War, for it is no war at all, but vengeance an eternal requiem sung for his murdered sister. C00150 Thou hast the right of it, dragonslayer. Comprehendest thou now the futility of thy quest? C00160 I have not come this far only to admit defeat. We can still return the Eye to Nidhogg, and beg forgiveness for our ancestors' crimes. Mayhap our words will sway him! C00170 Stubborn child... Thou thinkest in mortal terms. Our perception of time is too broad for thee to grasp. C00180 'Tis a simple matter for thee to offer thine apologies thou didst not perpetrate the crime. Despite thy visions, the deeds of history seem distant to thee. C00190 For a wyrm such as Nidhogg, however, that history is yet part of his present, as fresh as the blood that did gush from Ratatoskr's wounds. How could he not be driven mad? C00200 'Tis only by the calming embrace of Shiva's soul that mine own fury hath not consumed me. C00210 But let us speak no more of what is done. My faith in your kind is spent, and I would be alone. D00010 Well, what do you propose we do now? I, for one, am intent on continuing to the east... D00020 What is there to be found in the east? D00030 Nidhogg's lair the Aery is said to lie in that direction. And the Eye tells me he is near... D00040 You cannot still mean to slay him!? D00050 You cannot still mean to stop me. I have been true to my word, and aided you in this fool's errand with Hraesvelgr. D00060 But your efforts at parley have come to naught, Lady Iceheart. I would see Ishgard saved, and for that, Nidhogg must die. D00070 With the tale of our ancestors' vile betrayal yet ringing in your ears, you speak of continuing this war? D00080 Nay, lady, I would but pierce its vengeful heart. When Nidhogg dies, this war shall die with him. D00090 A moment, Estinien. You yourself spoke of the great wyrm's strength that you believed him powerful enough to raze your city to the ground. How then are we few to challenge him? D00100 Even behind the stout walls of Ishgard with an army of knights manning the defenses our victory would be hard-won. Yet you propose to contend with the beast in his own lair? D00110 In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And if the tales are true, the Warrior of Light has bested many an invincible foe. D00120 In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And with two Azure Dragoons working in unison, who can say what might be possible? D00130 But such speculation is meaningless if we cannot even find the wyrm. Our first task must be to seek out Nidhogg's lair. D00140 The story of this nation grows bloodier by the moment. Must death always be answered with more of the same? D00150 Such is the way of things, I fear. I shall consider it a miracle if mine armor is not stained crimson ere this conflict is ended. D00160 That I should be blinded by my own lies... Everything I believed... Everything I thought I was... Gone... All gone... D00170 Leave her. Your words will not reach her now. And we have not the time to wait for her to gather up the pieces of her shattered faith. E00010 Is that it? E00020 Aye... That would be the Aery. I feel Nidhogg's presence through the Eye his caustic hatred gnawing at my soul. E00030 'Twould seem the death of his consort has put him on guard. Mark how he wards his lair with tempestuous winds. E00040 A similar barrier once barred our entrance to the primal Garuda's domain...until we discovered the means by which it could be penetrated. E00050 Mayhap it is time we called upon Master Garlond. 'Twill be just like the good old days, no? F00010 Feast your eyes upon our latest and greatest feat of engineering! We call it a  manacutter ! F00020 After you put down Gaius, Wedge and me struck out on our own for a bit, and started work on the successor to the Tiny Bronco. F00030 Impressive little thing, isn't she? My talent for ship design has plainly rubbed off on them. F00040 They've adapted the principles of corrupted crystal technology, and constructed a mechanism which converts aether from its surroundings into elemental wind. Said wind is then harnessed by the specially engineered sails, providing the craft with propulsion and lift. All in all, a most elegant solution... F00050 ...I'm actually a little upset that I didn't think of it myself. F00060 The design does, however, come with one small flaw... F00070 The energy conversion ratio's bloody awful. To generate enough power to get you off the ground, you need to be in an area awash with predominantly wind-aspected aether. F00080 In other words, there are a few places you can fly...and lots of places you can't. F00090 The new Ishgardian airship hasn't left the boys much time for tinkering meaning it may be a while before this particular project takes off, if you'll forgive the pun. F00100 Hah...hah...hah... F00110 Tataru, what's happened!? F00120 I've been looking all over for you! There's been word from Ul'dah! It's about Her Grace, the sultana! F00130 It seems you're required elsewhere. Leave the manacutter with us. We'll see that she's airworthy and suitably equipped to slice through those winds. F00140 You, meanwhile, should concentrate on providing Raubahn and the sultana whatever help they need! G00010 Thank you for coming. G00020 No thanks are necessary, General. I trust your recuperation continues apace? G00030 I cannot complain. Thanks to Higiri and her ministrations, I've regained much of the strength I lost during my imprisonment. G00040 I gather you have made progress in the search for Her Grace. G00050 Aye, some good fortune at last. A few days past, Dewlala informed us that a sizable shipment of alchemical supplies had been delivered to the palace. G00060 With Papashan's assistance, I set out to ascertain the source and nature of the shipment. My inquiries led me to Frondale's Phrontistery. G00070 There I learned that an order had been placed for a curious substance designed to sustain patients trapped in deathlike slumber an invention of the former head alchemist, apparently. G00080 A deathlike slumber...? This cannot be a coincidence! G00090 It lends some weight to Dewlala's claims, aye. Her Grace is likely somewhere within the palace abed but alive. G00100 Before making any attempt to extricate the sultana, however, it seemed prudent to learn what manner of substance was used to induce her torpor. To that end, I made inquiries as to the whereabouts of the one most like to have administered it the lady-in-waiting, Meriel. G00110 We sent for you as soon as we learned of her location. All that remains is to apprehend the woman. G00120 We shall find our cat's-paw in the Silver Bazaar. G00130 But we must tread carefully. The market is not the bustling place it once was, and someone is sure to mark our coming. Should they inform the Monetarists, we'll have a fight on our hands. G00140 We must be prepared for the worst and being short an arm, I thought it wise to take another in its stead. What say you, Warrior of Light? Will you lend me yours? G00150 Then I pity the bastard that stands in our way. Come, my friends! For Nanamo...and for Ul'dah! H00010 You are Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting? H00020 I know no one of that name! Pray excuse me... H00030 General Aldynn!? H00040 We will have the truth from you, girl... H00050 Mayhap 'twould be better coming from me. H00060 Lolorito... You'd best talk fast. H00070 As you know, Teledji Adeledji's Carteneau Reclamation Bill was no more than a facade a means to get his grubby little hands on that Allagan monstrosity, Omega. H00080 When he learned of Nanamo's intention to abdicate, however, he was forced to amend his plans. Suddenly, assassination seemed the most promising way to further his ambitions. H00090 I am told Teledji had discovered a maid in whose veins ran the blood of House Thorne a new, more pliable puppet to sit the throne. 'Twould have caused an uproar, of course, but few could have contested her claim. H00100 'Twas plain that Teledji's wild machinations had outgrown our ability to control them. So I decided to usurp his scheme, and left the fool to seal his own demise. H00110 And what of Nanamo? H00120 Oh, I have no desire to harm Her Grace 'twould profit me little to destabilize our government. Thus did I employ young Meriel here to administer a potent sleeping potion in place of a poison. H00130 You should know, General, that your dear friend Ilberd was fully aware of my plan. H00140 I had him lie about the assassination as a means to prime your rage against Teledji. We weren't entirely sure how you would react, but things went rather better than expected. H00150 You conniving little worm... You had your claws in the Crystal Braves before their first recruit had sworn to serve! H00160 But of course. When a new game begins, 'tis only prudent to have a piece on the board. Ilberd was mine. H00170 Truth be told, a significant proportion of the Braves' initial endowment was also mine. With such large sums moving about, 'twas a rather trifling matter to disguise my own contribution. H00180 Ah, Ilberd... I secured his services with a promise to support his cause once my authority had been solidified. I swear, the man thinks of naught but prising Ala Mhigo from the grasp of the Empire. H00190 Unlike you, General, the poor fellow seems quite unable to forsake the land of his forefathers. Mayhap that's why he called you a traitor to your people and a disgrace to your homeland...amongst other things. What was it he always compared you to? Oh, yes!  An overgrown lapdog, begging for scraps at the sultana's table!  Oh, how we laughed... H00200 Alas, Ilberd's entertaining little outbursts eventually gave way to wearisome tirades, and the zealous brute became rather unruly. I had no wish to see you executed, you understand, but he would not take no for an answer. Rest assured, his employment with me has long since ended. H00210 ...Which brings us neatly to the present. What say you, General? Both you and the sultana are alive; we have one corpse and one fugitive; and preparations have been made to restore your good name. Shall we cry quits and start again with a blank ledger? Hm? H00220 The hells we will! Do you honestly expect me to forgive and forget? After all you've done!? You're guilty of high treason! H00230 Stay your blade, Master Aldynn! You yourself are not innocent! Or have you forgotten your own crime in executing Teledji Adeledji without trial!? H00240 Though you acted out of loyalty to the sultana, such deeds are in violation of both the word and spirit of the law! H00250 ...If you would, Lord Lolorito? H00260 This potion will wake the sultana from her slumber. Consider it a gesture of conciliation. H00270 You will find Her Grace resting comfortably within her private chambers. Should you doubt my word, I shall willingly accompany you to the palace as your hostage. H00280 I like not your motives, Lolorito...but you saved the sultana's life, and for that you have my gratitude. H00290 Raubahn Aldynn, you are hereby reinstated as general of the Immortal Flames! The citizens of Ul'dah shall once more be united under Nanamo Ul Namo, and together we shall usher in a new age of prosperity! I00010 Ugh... I00020 I was having the longest dream... I00030 'Tis time to wake up, Your Grace. Another day begins in Thanalan, and the sun blazes bright upon the sands. J00010 Her Grace is awoken. The palace physician assures me she is none the worse for her slumber. J00020 I believe Her Grace will soon resume her plans to place the government of Ul'dah into the hands of its citizens. J00030 Whatever path she chooses to take, I shall walk it with her. And we shall tread slowly, lest the nation be unsettled in our wake. J00040 Her Grace's compassion is a shining beacon to us all...but what our city truly thrives upon is competition. J00050 'Tis in the struggle against our rivals that opportunities are seized and fortunes made. And with the Empire on the offensive once more, now would hardly seem the time to turn our system of government upon its head. J00060 Are you privy to new intelligence, my lord? J00070 I would hardly call it new. Remind me: what was the name of that enormous imperial warship which met its end in Mor Dhona? Wait, I have it! The Agrius. Yes, well, 'twould appear that the Garleans have been hard at work on another such vessel. J00080 How close are they to completing this ship!? Is it operational!? J00090 Its maiden flight was a success, I hear. I should imagine Emperor Varis is eager to see how it performs in battle. J00100 My lords and ladies, I move that it is time to repair the damage caused by Teledji Adeledji, and prepare our great nation to repel the Empire once more. K00010 'Tis well that the sultana has awoken. The Syndicate yet needs to put its house in order, but 'twould seem the worst of the confusion has passed. K00020 Ul'dah has taken control of its future...and I must do the same. K00030 I have decided to disband the Crystal Braves. K00040 Among the recruits, there were those who supported our order's goals and convictions with all sincerity. 'Tis my hope that these loyal men and women will choose to remain our allies in the battles to come. K00050 As for those who sided with the traitor, Ilberd, they shall be hunted down and held to account for their crimes. It is my earnest hope that they will surrender themselves peaceably when the time comes...though I think it unlikely. K00060 Ah, my all-conquering Crystal Braves... The model army meant to pave the way for a single, unified Grand Company of Eorzea. That so high an ideal should be brought so low... K00070 I need not tell you how deeply the betrayal stung me. Yet I see now that it was mine own naivety and pride which allowed the Braves to fall prey to corruption. K00080 As ever, it is to your own shining example that I turn for inspiration. Like you, I mean to stand firm in the face of hardship, and give mine all for the cause. K00090 Let us resume the search for our missing comrades, that we might come together to shine the light of dawn across the realm once more. K00100 The role of Crystal Brave commander suited me ill, and I shall play it no longer. Henceforth, I shall be no more or less than Alphinaud, proud member of the Scions. L00010 All stands ready, Lord Commander. L00020 Ah, the moment has come, then? L00030 Pray excuse my lateness. I paid a brief visit to the workshop to inquire about the manacutters. The engineers assure me that they are ready. L00040 The Aery is now but a short flight away. Yet what a long and winding path we took to reach this point. L00050 Were it not for Master Alphinaud's proposal, we never would have attempted to parley with the dragons. L00060 Though our negotiations yielded little, our expedition with Lady Iceheart taught us much. L00070 You took an unimaginable risk... I could scarce believe the tale Estinien told. L00080 Aye, 'tis true that many of our countrymen would sooner die than join hands with the heretics' mistress, but 'twas through that most unlikely of alliances that we came to speak with Hraesvelgr. L00090 A conversation that went rather poorly, as I recall. L00100 In this instance, the journey was more important than the destination. Had we not slain Nidhogg's consort, Tioman, and put the great wyrm on his guard, the Dravanians would have arrived at Ishgard's walls long ago. L00110 Aye, that they would. Full grateful am I for every hour of respite your actions have afforded us. Thanks to you, our defenses are much improved. 'Tis but a pity they won't be enough. L00120 Thus you believe an assault upon the Aery represents the city's best chance of survival. Is that not so, Estinien? L00130 I am under no illusions. Nidhogg's might is legendary. But with his eye in my possession, I can stifle his strength at the source. L00140 Victory will be hard-won, even so, and I shall be glad indeed to have the Warrior of Light at my side. L00150 You shall have my blade as well. There are more of these  manacutters  to be had, yes? L00160 (-Lucia-)Lord Commander, no! L00170 How can I, a proud knight of Ishgard, stand by and do naught while an outsider risks life and limb for our homeland? I swore an oath to protect this city! L00180 Pray leave the slaying of dragons to dragoons, ser knight. Your duty to command the city's defense is no less vital. L00190 Should we fail, and Nidhogg slip through our grasp, who, then, will hold the walls against him? Will you leave Ishgard in the hands of the Holy See's zealots? L00200 There are others  L00210 Who but you has the authority and the standing to orchestrate a citywide defense? I do not, and neither does the Warrior of Light. That is why it is our place to fight, and yours to remain here, Lord Commander. L00220 What, you too, Master Alphinaud? By the Fury... You have shown some promise, but this adversary is far beyond your skills. L00230 Your candor is appreciated, ser dragoon. I shall remain, then, and cheer you from afar. L00240 Well, my friend, 'twould seem I have discouraged the last of the volunteers, and claimed the task as ours alone. But if any alive can best this wyrm, 'tis surely we two! M00010 We're through! M00020 So, this is the Aery! Where are you Nidhogg!? You have guests! M00030 There! M00040 Greetings, Lord of Dravania! I believe we have something that belongs to you! M00050 Wicked mortals! I shall melt your flesh, and turn your bones to ash! N00010 Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity! N00020 I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again! N00030 No, wyrm! This ends here! N00040 You gifted my people a thousand years of suffering. Now I gift you an eternity in darkness! O00010 They are ours, Lord Haldrath... The eyes of Nidhogg! O00020 Aye... The wyrm lies broken and my father is avenged. With the wellspring of his vitality thus denied him, Nidhogg shall not linger long in this world. O00030 But behold the terrible price we have paid. My sire is dead; so many brother knights slain. O00040 We traded our honor for the strength which now courses in our veins. And still we are forced to make such sacrifice. O00050 But not in vain, my lord. Hraesvelgr is the only great wyrm left in Dravania, and he dares not leave his lair. O00060 With Nidhogg's eyes in your possession, who now can challenge the might of Ishgard? Ascend the throne, and take your rightful place as the ruler of our people! O00070 Nay, my friend, I must forsake the mantle of king. Though Nidhogg be defeated, his wyrmling horde yet darkens the skies with wings beyond counting. O00080 As one who partook of Ratatoskr's strength, it shall be my penance to bear a knight's arms until death grants me leave to retire. When that day comes, no prince shall perish, but a hells-bound hunter of dragons... O00090 But Lord Haldrath! What then shall become of the royal line!? O00100 Think of your people, my lord! Without a king, who will the common man turn to in his hour of need? How will he find his way without your benevolent hand to guide him? O00110 I thank you, Ser Flavien and Ser Sylvetrel for dispelling my remaining doubts. With men of such wisdom and compassion in service to the realm, 'tis plain that Ishgard has no need of a king. O00120 But if you must bow to the demands of tradition, you need look no further than yourselves for one worthy to wear the crown. O00130 Fare thee well, my brother knights...my loyal friends. On these shoulders shall I bear the weight of my father's sins; with this lance shall I repay the debt accrued through our misdeeds. O00140 What cruel jest has fate played upon us...? Have we seized this desperate victory only to lose a king? O00150 We can but act as our lord has bid. We few who remain must divide between us the rulership of Ishgard and her people. O00160 Not I. My oath was to Lord Haldrath, and he alone. If he is not to be king, then I would hang up my shield, as well. O00170 Will you abandon us, too, ser? O00180 I would wash my hands of blood and betrayal and take up an honest trade. Mayhap I shall serve ale instead of sharpened steel... O00190 We four, then... O00200 Fortemps, Haillenarte, Durendaire, and Dzemael... O00210 But four houses to rule all of Ishgard... O00220 ...And what of the throne? O00230 We keep it empty. Until the day a king rises once more, we must assume the role of stewards. O00240 We shall shape our nation anew with a history of our own making and let the truth of this dark day die here, upon the battlefield. P00010 What ails you, friend!? Are you wounded? P00020 You have borne witness to history...to the culmination of the first battle with Nidhogg. P00030 The legend of Ishgard's founding tells that our ancestors were led to the land of Coerthas by the valiant King Thordan. P00040 In the midst of their journey, they came to a wide chasm, where they were set upon by a great wyrm Nidhogg. A furious battle then ensued, with Thordan leading the van. P00050 Though the brave king was slain defending his people, his son, Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon, fought on undaunted... P00060 And with a mighty thrust of his lance, he gouged out Nidhogg's eye, forcing the wicked creature into retreat. P00070 Thus did this eldritch orb become a sacred treasure of Ishgard, lending its power to every knight deemed worthy to bear the title of Azure Dragoon. P00080 A rousing tale, is it not? Would that I could still believe it. But your vision, which we must accept as immutable truth, leaves no room for doubt save on one point. P00090 If Haldrath took both of Nidhogg's eyes, then how came this eye to be lodged in the wyrm's skull? P00100 Beneath every answer we unearth, another question lies buried... Q00010 'Twas a fierce battle, but one I knew we would win. Your fame is well deserved, Warrior of Light. Full proud am I to have fought at your side. Q00020 I would fain return with all swiftness to Ishgard to inform the lord commander of our triumph... Q00030 But we must first have words with Hraesvelgr. There are parts of this tale that the wyrm has kept from us, and I would know wherefore... R00010 Impenitent mortals, ever seeking to bury old wrongs under new. R00020 I did sense the moment of Nidhogg's demise... R00030 You mean the moment I prised your eye from his head? R00040 'Twould seem thou hast uncovered my secret. Aye. Unto the blinded Nidhogg did I yield one half of my strength... S00010 Nidhogg... What hath befallen thee? S00020 We are undone by covetous mortals. They did take Ratatoskr's eyes...and glut their appetites upon her essence... S00030 She is slain, then? What madness hath unmade our peaceful accord!? S00040 Did I not warn thee, brood-brother? They have ever been untrustworthy creatures, these short-lived Elezen. S00050 But thou wert enchanted by thy mortal maid. Thy folly hath cost Ratatoskr her life, and me mine eyes... S00060 Oh, my beloved Shiva... How swiftly are thy kin made bestial by their appetites. S00070 Hraesvelgr. 'Twas thy blindness that did invite disaster into our lands. Surrender thee an eye to me, and let that be thy penance. S00080 Nidhogg... S00090 They bested me once, but I was reckless. I shall need but a single eye to inflict enduring torment upon these traitors and every child of their line! S00100 Yield to me thy strength, brood-brother! S00110 My vengeance is begun! T00010 Thou hast borne witness to a scene from my past. T00020 It was yours... Your strength that sustained Nidhogg all these years... T00030 Would that Haldrath had dealt the wyrm a killing blow... T00040 When my brood-brother did appear before me, bloody and blinded, his life was all but spent. He demanded half my vigor, that he might exact his revenge upon the mortals who had wronged us. T00050 And so you acquiesced! You surrendered your eye to Nidhogg knowing full well the suffering he would inflict! T00060 The peace my beloved so dearly desired had been shattered by her own kin. T00070 Their treachery claimed my brood-sister's life and my brood-brother's reason! Thinkest thou thy fits of indignation will move me to remorse!? T00080 Go, mortals! Take your unruly passions and leave this place... Your presence here spelleth naught but misery. T00090 Were it not for Shiva's soothing embrace, I would slay you where you stand. Woe betide you should the bond we share ever weaken! U00010 'Twas my life's goal to slay Nidhogg, but I find there is little joy to be had in its accomplishment. U00020 But you have rid the world of a hate-filled creature, and ended a bloody war in so doing... U00030 I lost my family to Nidhogg's flames. And 'twas with fury in my heart that I took up the lance. Every blow I struck, I struck in the name of vengeance. We were not so different, he and I. U00040 I will not judge you for your deeds I have not the right. Too many innocents have perished in the name of my  greater good.  U00050 Yet even with all that has passed, the tale is incomplete. U00060 We are short a great wyrm's eye. Of the pair which Haldrath took from Nidhogg, only one is known to us the one I bear. What, then, became of the other? U00070 Why did Nidhogg, who had taken such pains to prolong the Dragonsong War, suddenly decide to hurl his entire army against the walls of Ishgard? U00080 Lord Commander... Aye, the deed is done. Nidhogg is slain. U00090 What? ...In the city!? A battle with whom!? U00100 At once, Lord Commander. Hold firm till our return. U00110 Fighting has broken out in the city. Lord Aymeric was sparse with the particulars, but it seems some commoners threw open the gates to a force of heretics. U00120 I gave no order to attack! U00130 Are we to mark the end of the Dragonsong War by spilling the blood of our own? Mayhap Hraesvelgr was right about us... U00140 Let us away, Warrior of Light. The people must be saved from themselves. U00150 Wait! I would join you! U00160 There has been enough violence. I will appeal to my people in the city and make them see reason! U00170 Come, then, Lady Iceheart. Let us write the final chapter in this damnable war. V00010 A small army of heretics has invaded the city, Your Eminence. V00020 But there is no cause for concern. A sizable contingent of our soldiers is already in place to repel the Dravanian assault, and the intruders will soon find themselves outnumbered and outmatched. V00030 Our plans proceed apace, then. V00040 Yes, Your Eminence. This unrest shall serve to feed the people's fear of the heretics and the dragons both. V00050 And lend renewed fervor to their prayers for deliverance... V00060 Very good. Grant our guests what time they need to sow a measure of chaos, then order the Temple Knights to crush them. V00070 Your will be done. V00080 The moment is at hand? V00090 Excellent. All shall soon be in alignment. V00100 It is time for the Bringer of Light to die.",

There is no need for further bloodshed!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000030</h1>\n\n<p>My lady!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000040</h1>\n\n<p>She is come!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000050</h1>\n\n<p>Hear me, brothers and sisters! The war is ended! Nidhogg is no more!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000060</h1>\n\n<p>Aye, it is so! This adventurer and the Azure Dragoon laid the great wyrm low!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000070</h1>\n\n<p>The endless cycle of violence between man and dragon was born of our forefathers' treachery.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000080</h1>\n\n<p>You have followed me\u2500bled with me\u2500to bring this truth to light, that we might all know peace!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000090</h1>\n\n<p>But Nidhogg is dead\u2500Nidhogg is dead, my friends! He who bore such hatred towards Ishgard is dead!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000100</h1>\n\n<p>Let his hatred die with him, I say! Let us sheathe our swords and go in peace!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000110</h1>\n\n<p>Have we lost!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000120</h1>\n\n<p>No, my friend, far from it! At long last, the peace for which we have so desperately fought is within our grasp! And I for one would not forsake it!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000130</h1>\n\n<p>Peace...?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000140</h1>\n\n<p>Seize the witch! Let none escape!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000150</h1>\n\n<p>Providing aid and succor to the wounded should be our first concern.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>000160</h1>\n\n<p>If the heretics mean to observe the peace, then it would be folly not to do the same!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100010</h1>\n\n<p>Praise Halone, you are safe!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100020</h1>\n\n<p>My safety was never in doubt, Father, for I had the Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light by my side.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100030</h1>\n\n<p>We bring the most wonderful tidings!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100040</h1>\n\n<p>The infamous Lady Iceheart, here in Ishgard? This is most unexpected...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100050</h1>\n\n<p>She has done much to quell the violence. The inquisition may not approve, but we are glad of her presence.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100060</h1>\n\n<p>And with the great wyrm's demise, even our nation's more reactionary elements will have scant grounds to press for her immediate impeachment.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100070</h1>\n\n<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100080</h1>\n\n<p>What of the truth revealed to us by Hraesvelgr? That the origins of the Dragonsong War\u2500a core tenet of Ishgardian faith\u2500are quite unlike those depicted in the scriptures.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100090</h1>\n\n<p>...That men and dragons once lived together in harmony, and that it was man's treachery which shattered the peace and plunged our peoples into war.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100100</h1>\n\n<p>The same scripture also describes the origins of the High Houses. Were it exposed as false, the legitimacy of our rule would be called into question.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100110</h1>\n\n<p>If both highborn and lowborn can trace their ancestry to Thordan and his knights twelve...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100120</h1>\n\n<p>But a single sip of dragon's blood is required to confirm their lineage.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100130</h1>\n\n<p>If the Holy See knew of this and chose to remain silent, their crimes are grievous indeed. Regardless, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100140</h1>\n\n<p>Ser Aymeric! You cannot mean to raise this matter with the archbishop!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100150</h1>\n\n<p>Pray consider what you are proposing! If the Holy See chose to conceal the truth for centuries, what reason would they have to reveal it now!?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100160</h1>\n\n<p>At best, you will be branded a heretic and clapped in irons!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100170</h1>\n\n<p>Then, at least, the archbishop will have shown his true colors. My friends, this war will never truly be at an end until the truth is made known.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100180</h1>\n\n<p>You must see what lies on the horizon if it is not. When ruled by fear of a common enemy, we were united.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>100190</h1>\n\n<p>But now we have none. During the war, the highborn needed men to lead, and the lowborn, men to follow.

What are they on about?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400030</h1>\n\n<p>The High Houses, and what makes a nobleman so bleedin' noble. They trace their blood back to King Thordan and his knights twelve\u2500the founders of Ishgard.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400040</h1>\n\n<p>But our friends here reckon we're all descended from the heroes of eld\u2500highborn and lowborn alike.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400050</h1>\n\n<p>And so Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights, has gone to ask the archbishop if he wouldn't mind lettin' everyone know.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400060</h1>\n\n<p>Is he simple!? The old bastard'll have him executed for heresy!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400070</h1>\n\n<p>Well, seems to me that's what the good ser wants. Seems he thinks a noble sacrifice will serve to prove his claims.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400080</h1>\n\n<p>We cannot stand idly by and allow Ser Aymeric to do this. Ishgard has need of him.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>400090</h1>\n\n<p>Look, you've a good heart. I can see that. Willin' to risk your neck for someone else, even when his troubles ain't yours.

You knew this to be true. You knew and you concealed it!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>900030</h1>\n\n<p>I should be interested to hear how you came by this knowledge. But yes, you have the right of it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00010</h1>\n\n<p>The architects of Ishgard, King Thordan and his knights twelve, entrapped and butchered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, that they might partake of her eyes, and thereby transcend their mortal limits.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00020</h1>\n\n<p>Upon learning of their treachery, Nidhogg was consumed with a murderous\u2500and justified\u2500rage. I daresay you know what followed...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00030</h1>\n\n<p>The great wyrm slew the king and half of his knights.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00040</h1>\n\n<p>Aye...but Nidhogg was subdued, and his eyes plucked from their sockets by the knights that remained.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00050</h1>\n\n<p>Their one mistake was to show mercy, for from his brother Hraesvelgr did Nidhogg receive a new eye, thus rejuvenating his form and empowering him to embark upon an eternal quest for vengeance.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00060</h1>\n\n<p>...Whilst Thordan's son Haldrath took one of Nidhogg's eyes and learned to wield its power in defense of his people...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>A00070</h1>\n\n<p>Thus was the first Azure Dragoon born. And ever since that time, his honored successors have risen to drive Nidhogg from our lands whenever the wyrm has returned to plague us.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00010</h1>\n\n<p>I ask you, my son: will you answer for my sins? Will your son and his son answer for me as well?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00020</h1>\n\n<p>What do you mean?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00030</h1>\n\n<p>If a man cannot atone for his sins in the course of his all-too-fleeting life, must his progeny then be held to account? Must every subsequent generation be judged as well?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00040</h1>\n\n<p>Thordan's betrayal of Ratatoskr was an unconscionable, unforgivable sin.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00050</h1>\n\n<p>Should we, then, as his descendants, meekly surrender ourselves to an eternity of punishment?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00060</h1>\n\n<p>Nay, say I. I would not see our children sacrificed in a vain attempt to appease an implacable foe.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00070</h1>\n\n<p>Dragons are not like us, my son. To they who live forever, the wrongs of antiquity are as those of yesterday. No reparations shall ever suffice.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00080</h1>\n\n<p>This fact alone should serve as ample justification for our actions, yet some refuse to see it as such. For men like you, who yearn to commit themselves to a nobler cause, a more compelling narrative is required.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00090</h1>\n\n<p>This is your solution!? This is how you protect our people?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00100</h1>\n\n<p>You have given us a lost cause! A death sentence! With your compelling narrative, you but doom our countrymen to give their lives for a lie!</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00110</h1>\n\n<p>And they do so gladly. Highborn and lowborn alike are proud to serve\u2500to fight and die for their country.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00120</h1>\n\n<p>And what would you say to them?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00130</h1>\n\n<p>What would you tell the wives who have lost their husbands, the mothers who have lost their sons? ...That their loved ones died for naught?</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00140</h1>\n\n<p>I...</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>B00150</h1>\n\n<p>Over the course of a thousand years, countless men have donned these robes, and every one of them came to accept the necessity of this solution.

Nidhogg is no more! 000060 Aye, it is so! This adventurer and the Azure Dragoon laid the great wyrm low! 000070 The endless cycle of violence between man and dragon was born of our forefathers' treachery. 000080 You have followed me bled with me to bring this truth to light, that we might all know peace! 000090 But Nidhogg is dead Nidhogg is dead, my friends! He who bore such hatred towards Ishgard is dead! 000100 Let his hatred die with him, I say! Let us sheathe our swords and go in peace! 000110 Have we lost!? 000120 No, my friend, far from it! At long last, the peace for which we have so desperately fought is within our grasp! And I for one would not forsake it! 000130 Peace...? 000140 Seize the witch! Let none escape! 000150 Providing aid and succor to the wounded should be our first concern. 000160 If the heretics mean to observe the peace, then it would be folly not to do the same! 100010 Praise Halone, you are safe! 100020 My safety was never in doubt, Father, for I had the Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light by my side. 100030 We bring the most wonderful tidings! 100040 The infamous Lady Iceheart, here in Ishgard? This is most unexpected... 100050 She has done much to quell the violence. The inquisition may not approve, but we are glad of her presence. 100060 And with the great wyrm's demise, even our nation's more reactionary elements will have scant grounds to press for her immediate impeachment. 100070 My thoughts exactly. 100080 What of the truth revealed to us by Hraesvelgr? That the origins of the Dragonsong War a core tenet of Ishgardian faith are quite unlike those depicted in the scriptures. 100090 ...That men and dragons once lived together in harmony, and that it was man's treachery which shattered the peace and plunged our peoples into war. 100100 The same scripture also describes the origins of the High Houses. Were it exposed as false, the legitimacy of our rule would be called into question. 100110 If both highborn and lowborn can trace their ancestry to Thordan and his knights twelve... 100120 But a single sip of dragon's blood is required to confirm their lineage. 100130 If the Holy See knew of this and chose to remain silent, their crimes are grievous indeed. Regardless, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. 100140 Ser Aymeric! You cannot mean to raise this matter with the archbishop!? 100150 Pray consider what you are proposing! If the Holy See chose to conceal the truth for centuries, what reason would they have to reveal it now!? 100160 At best, you will be branded a heretic and clapped in irons! 100170 Then, at least, the archbishop will have shown his true colors. My friends, this war will never truly be at an end until the truth is made known. 100180 You must see what lies on the horizon if it is not. When ruled by fear of a common enemy, we were united. 100190 But now we have none. During the war, the highborn needed men to lead, and the lowborn, men to follow. Not anymore. 'Tis but a matter of time before the old order is called into question. 100200 Lady Iceheart will share the truth with her followers, and the Holy See will be powerless to stop its spread. The disenfranchised will rise up, united, and blood will flow in the streets once more... 100210 A divided Ishgard will not survive. 100220 Tread carefully, Lord Commander... 200010 My lady, is it wise to let him go? 200020 I sympathize with the lord commander's desire for reform, but to approach the archbishop in this manner bespeaks an idealism to which I did not think Ser Aymeric prone. 200030 Though he comports himself as a realist, he has long dreamt of reform. 'Twas that idealism which first drew me to him that which made me swear an oath to serve. 200040 We must not think of ways to hinder his cause, but rather ways to aid it even should the Holy See cry heresy. 200050 You cannot mean... 200060 If the lord commander does not return from the Vault at the appointed hour, I mean to go and fetch him. 200070 Have care, my lady your words border on treason! Should they reach the wrong ears, you would be declared an enemy of Ishgard! 200080 That is a risk I am willing to take. Lest you forget, my lord I am not born of this land. My loyalty is to the lord commander alone. 200090 But I speak only of what may come to pass. If the rumors regarding his heritage are to be believed, we have naught to fear. 200100 Hmph. Lies and slander. 200110 Forgive me what rumors are these? 200120 That Ser Aymeric is the archbishop's bastard son. 200130 Senior clergy are not permitted to marry and sire children. But even the holiest among us are not immune to temptation. 200140 I labor to believe it... Ser Aymeric is truly the archbishop's son? 200150 He has never been publicly acknowledged as such, but the rumors have plagued him since childhood. 200160 That he rose to his current position, despite being despised as a bastard, and accused of profiting from his father's influence, bespeaks the quality of his character. 200170 It is my hope that on this occasion, the burden of his birth will work in his favor. Should our worst fears be realized, the archbishop will not be so quick to execute his own flesh and blood, affording us time to mount a rescue. 200180 Bastard or trueborn, he is our nation's best hope. If the Holy See dares to threaten him, I shall lead the charge against the Vault myself. 200190 Hear, hear! The future of Ishgard rests on Ser Aymeric's shoulders! I too will do mine utmost to aid his cause! 200200 Haurchefant, be reasonable... 200210 A knight lives to serve, Father to aid those in need! The people need Ser Aymeric more than ever and we may be his only hope! 200220 There is no greater calling for a knight than to save the life of his fellow man. I swear to you, on the sigil of our house, that I shall do this and make you proud. 200230 Even you? <sigh> Romantic, reckless fools, the lot of you. So be it make your preparations. 200240 I thank you all for your support. 300010 Where d'you think you're goin', missy? 300020 I-I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend! 300030 What's going on here!? 300040 What's it to you, boy!? Piss off! 300050 Hold on! I've seen them around. They're in and out of House Fortemps's manor all the time. 300060 Ohhh, I see. Skulkin' about at your highborn masters' biddin', eh? Bloodhounds hopin' to catch a whiff of heresy, is that it? 300070 You are quite mistaken, I assure you. We came here to help. And if you know what's good for you, you will let us pass! 300080 Haha! Listen to the pup's yappin'! Come here, boy I'll give you cause to yelp! 300090 (-???-)Enough! Leave threatenin' women and children to our  betters ! We don't have the knack!  300100 Hilda!? 300110 Lay a finger on the blue bloods' pups and you're like to lose the hand. 300120 It ain't often I get called on by glorious heroes like yourself. So tell me: what have I done to deserve you? 400010 ...So while you were on your way to kill Nidhogg, you stumbled on some dirty secrets that the Holy See has been hidin' for centuries. 400020 Eh? What are they on about? 400030 The High Houses, and what makes a nobleman so bleedin' noble. They trace their blood back to King Thordan and his knights twelve the founders of Ishgard. 400040 But our friends here reckon we're all descended from the heroes of eld highborn and lowborn alike. 400050 And so Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights, has gone to ask the archbishop if he wouldn't mind lettin' everyone know. 400060 Is he simple!? The old bastard'll have him executed for heresy! 400070 Well, seems to me that's what the good ser wants. Seems he thinks a noble sacrifice will serve to prove his claims. 400080 We cannot stand idly by and allow Ser Aymeric to do this. Ishgard has need of him. 400090 Look, you've a good heart. I can see that. Willin' to risk your neck for someone else, even when his troubles ain't yours. But what's this got to do with me? 400100 If Ser Aymeric is imprisoned in the Vault, we will need all the help we can muster to breach their defenses and rescue him. 400110 What in the hells !? 400120 <sniff> Ahhh, the unmistakable scent of heresy... 400130 And what do we have here? The honored guests of House Fortemps consorting with the queen of rats? 400140 Oooh. Plotting insurrection I shouldn't wonder! Tsk-tsk. That won't do. 400150 Sickness is wont to fester and spread. It must be burned out ere the infection takes hold. 400160 I reckon ser'd be happy to wield the irons himself. Well, so happens I've got irons of my own. 400170 Ahahaha! Such simple creatures, rats. Certain to attack when cornered. 400180 Let us step outside, milady. In here, your toys could hurt someone. 500010 There's no denying your gifts... A well-deserved reputation indeed. 500020 Enough! 500030 Hmph. 500040 Gah! Lucky bastard. 500050 Nay...'tis we who are lucky. Had we fought on, 'twas but a matter of time before our conflict claimed the life of an innocent bystander. 500060 I thought the Heavens' Ward might come here as well. 500070 They came to the Temple Knights' headquarters? 500080 Aye. Ser Grinnaux announced that the lord commander had been imprisoned under suspicion of heresy, and that the Heavens' Ward had been granted full authority in his stead. 500090 Then the Heavens' Ward now commands the Temple Knights... 500100 Those still loyal to Ser Aymeric answer to me. Alas, that amounts to but half our number. 500110 The other half, who opposed his promotion to lord commander, have gathered at the Vault as ordered. 500120 Bolsterin' the guard already, eh? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're expected. 500130 I take it you're in charge around here? 500140 Hilda, and yes. The young master was just persuadin' me to join his lost cause. Convincin' little beggar, isn't he? 500150 Aye, your passion moved me a bit. That, and the fact that we're sick of livin' off the leavin's of our  betters.  500160 If you've a mind to change things around here, then we've a mind to join you! 600010 Our power... How can this be!? 600020 Fall back! 600030 Father, please! 600041 For a mercy, we were not too late. 600050 Why must you do this, Father!? 600060 Nidhogg is fallen! There is no need for further deception! Now is the time to renounce the lies which led us down this path to start anew! 600070 And tear down the very pillars of our society our history, our values everything we have built over a thousand years? <sigh> A fool to the last. 600080 Look out! 600090 Go. Azys Lla awaits. 600100 Lord Haurchefant! 600105 It's no good... The wound is too deep. It refuses to mend... 600110 You...you are unharmed? F-Forgive me... I could not bear the thought of...of... 600120 Oh, do not look at me so. 600121 A smile better suits a hero... 700010 Don't. Please. 700020 A knight lives to serve. To protect. To sacrifice. There is no greater calling. 700030 Leave me to mourn, and give chase. For my son, and for the nation he loved. Go. 700040 ...His sacrifice shall not be forgotten. 700050 My son... 800010 My friends. I am in your debt. 800020 Think nothing of it. Your wounds are healing well, I trust? 800030 Some wounds do not heal... 900010 The founding, the scriptures a thousand years of lies all to deceive the common man! 900020 Nay, our own brothers and sisters for the blood of the knights twelve flows within all our veins! You knew this to be true. You knew and you concealed it! 900030 I should be interested to hear how you came by this knowledge. But yes, you have the right of it. A00010 The architects of Ishgard, King Thordan and his knights twelve, entrapped and butchered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, that they might partake of her eyes, and thereby transcend their mortal limits. A00020 Upon learning of their treachery, Nidhogg was consumed with a murderous and justified rage. I daresay you know what followed... A00030 The great wyrm slew the king and half of his knights. A00040 Aye...but Nidhogg was subdued, and his eyes plucked from their sockets by the knights that remained. A00050 Their one mistake was to show mercy, for from his brother Hraesvelgr did Nidhogg receive a new eye, thus rejuvenating his form and empowering him to embark upon an eternal quest for vengeance. A00060 ...Whilst Thordan's son Haldrath took one of Nidhogg's eyes and learned to wield its power in defense of his people... A00070 Thus was the first Azure Dragoon born. And ever since that time, his honored successors have risen to drive Nidhogg from our lands whenever the wyrm has returned to plague us. B00010 I ask you, my son: will you answer for my sins? Will your son and his son answer for me as well? B00020 What do you mean? B00030 If a man cannot atone for his sins in the course of his all-too-fleeting life, must his progeny then be held to account? Must every subsequent generation be judged as well? B00040 Thordan's betrayal of Ratatoskr was an unconscionable, unforgivable sin. B00050 Should we, then, as his descendants, meekly surrender ourselves to an eternity of punishment? B00060 Nay, say I. I would not see our children sacrificed in a vain attempt to appease an implacable foe. B00070 Dragons are not like us, my son. To they who live forever, the wrongs of antiquity are as those of yesterday. No reparations shall ever suffice. B00080 This fact alone should serve as ample justification for our actions, yet some refuse to see it as such. For men like you, who yearn to commit themselves to a nobler cause, a more compelling narrative is required. B00090 This is your solution!? This is how you protect our people? B00100 You have given us a lost cause! A death sentence! With your compelling narrative, you but doom our countrymen to give their lives for a lie! B00110 And they do so gladly. Highborn and lowborn alike are proud to serve to fight and die for their country. B00120 And what would you say to them? B00130 What would you tell the wives who have lost their husbands, the mothers who have lost their sons? ...That their loved ones died for naught? B00140 I... B00150 Over the course of a thousand years, countless men have donned these robes, and every one of them came to accept the necessity of this solution. Once, I hoped you might come to accept it as well. B00160 Do not despair, my son. Soon I shall free us from the sins of antiquity... B00170 ...And bring about the change you so fervently desire. B00180 If he has spoken with others, I would have their names. Escort him to a cell and question him thoroughly. B00190 Your Eminence. C00010 You saw something, did you not? A vision of the past? C00020 So this is the power of the Echo. Would that it had shown you a finer moment from my past. C00030 'Twas an exercise in futility, as you saw. Faced with the firmity of his conviction, and his many ready rejoinders, my words deserted me. To be frank, I am embarrassed to recall it. C00040 A friend once impressed upon me the importance of differentiating between words, deeds, and beliefs. Were he here, I suspect he would judge your father's  conviction  to be no more than rank, self-serving delusion. C00050 Even so, I cannot help but wonder what manner of  change  he intends to bring about. C00060 I have given some thought to that as well. C00070 During the battle within the Vault, the Heavens' Ward demonstrated strange and unnatural abilities. C00080 Aye, the manner in which Ser Zephirin struck down Lord Haurchefant was unlike anything I've ever seen before. C00090 The spectacle called to mind King Thordan and his knights twelve as they are depicted in scripture holy powers and all... C00100 Mere fabrications...which have become objects of faith...instilled with the belief of countless devoted souls... C00110 Seven hells! C00120 If Lady Iceheart can use her own body as a vessel for summoning, I see no reason why others could not... C00130 Are the Heavens' Ward truly so reckless? C00140 Unbelievable. C00150 As they fled, my father spoke of Azys Lla. C00160 Though I know not what he intends, I fear no good shall come of it. His ambitions are too great, and his minions too powerful... C00170 We must find the Heavens' Ward, and stop my father, before it is too late.",

Finish the guildhest objectives before time expires, and you and your companions will be promptly rewarded for services rendered. Drag your feet, though, and you won't see a single coin. If it is your first time tackling an operation, you will also be provided with a bonus upon completion. Finally, proving yourself on the field will unlock more high-profile tasks. Other battlewardens stationed throughout the Twelveswood may also provide you with similar work, but only if you are deemed capable. ERROR You were unable to commence the operation  .  HOWTO Wait... Might this be your first time participating in a guildhest? I remember my first hest. It was the night of my twentieth nameday. My fellow guildmates invited me to join them in the slaying of a family of peistes who were stealing chocobo eggs from Bentbranch Meadows. The moment we arrived, one of the terrible beasts immediately turned to me and charged. The thing was thrice my size and had already maimed several chocobokeeps. There was no way I could win, so I simply froze and waited for the end. But that's when I remembered that I was not alone. My friends rallied around me, and together we defeated the peistes! That, my friend, is what a guildhest is truly about.",

Whyever would they agree to carry about letters?\u201d<br/>\n\"Why\" indeed! If I had my way, I'd be curled up under the canopy of a nice oak dreaming about some beautiful mooglette with a rainbow-colored pom-pom, kupo!<br/>\nBut no, the moon had to go and drop from the sky, causing all of that terrible commotion! Aetherytes were shattered and linkpearls rendered useless. For moons, the poor, wingless people of Eorzea had no way of communicating with each other...beyond screaming at the top of their lungs, which no one really approved of, kupo.<br/>\nThat is, until the little horned ones asked us to assist them by delivering messages. At first we were wary of showing ourselves, worried that one of you might catch and skin us, like you do every other forest furry. But once we saw how much we were appreciated, we knew we'd found our new calling!<br/>\nAnd I personally promise to try and not read any along the way, kupo!<br/>\nGreetings and salutations! Wondering why I'm wearing this funny hat and toting around this oversized bag, kupo? Well, it just so happens that I had a dream the other night. A dream of moogles like me who spent their days delivering letters to travelers like you.<br/>\nI thought, I could do that\u2500so here I am! Should Feo Ul happen to receive any missives or epistles for you from beyond, I'll ensure that they safely find their way into your hands, kupo.<br/>\nYour speedy and accurate deliveries have earned you carrier level one, kupo! And yet, a delivery moogle's work is never done. Should you see the deputy postmoogle outside Limsa Lominsa's Bulwark Hall, that's your sign that we have another job for you!<br/>\nYour unflagging dedication to letter delivery has earned you carrier level one, kupo! I'm not certain what that means, I'm afraid, but Feo Ul insisted that I pass on the word. They also mentioned that if you're looking for more work, you should speak to the moogle who looks like me, but lives by the sea beyond.<br/>\nYour postal prowess has earned you carrier level one, kupo! A letter carrier's heart is a restless one, always thinking of the next job. If the deputy postmoogle has another letter for you, he'll be outside Limsa Lominsa's Bulwark Hall. Run to him, kupo. Run, don't walk!<br/>\nI must convey my congratulations again! Where once stood a rank amateur, now stands a veritable maestro of mail carrying, kupo. The countless postmoogles you have inspired are carrying your torch well. We may call upon you again, but until that day\u2500stay safe in your adventures!<br/>\nFeo Ul was saying that the delivery moogles from \u201cbeyond\u201d\u2500wherever that is, kupo\u2500have high hopes for you!

I'm afraid I don't have any letters for you today. If I did, of course, I'd deliver them to you with speed and gusto! Look what we have here! A new letter has arrived just for you, kupo! Look what we have here! A new letter has arrived for our favorite assistant. Our loyal assistant is rewarded for her persistence! A new letter has arrived for you, kupo. Kupo-ho-ho! I'm pleased to say that I have a new letter for you, my most proficient pupil! Let me see now... Why, yes! I do have a new letter addressed to UNKNOWN. Isn't today your lucky day, kupo? Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters, kupo! Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters! I would have expected our favorite assistant to be more organized, kupo! Your mailbox is filling up fast! I won't be able to fit in any more letters unless you do something, kupo! And then where will you be? A consummate carrier like yourself letting her mailbox go unattended? This simply won't do, kupo! Do some cleaning, and with haste, lest there be no room for new deliveries! Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters! Your mailbox is a complete and utter mess! There wasn't any room left, so I had to send back a letter, kupo! Your mailbox is a complete and utter mess! There wasn't any room left, so I had to send back a letter, kupo! Perhaps you've been spending too much time delivering others' letters and not enough attending to your own? Your mailbox is a complete and utter mess! There wasn't any room left, so I had to send back a letter, kupo! The phrontists say that a letter carrier with an unkempt mailbox is like a barber with an unbled cousin... Your mailbox is a complete and utter mess! There wasn't any room left, so I had to send back a letter, kupo! To see my prized pupil be so careless why, it brings a tear to my eye... Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters, kupo! Greetings, tall one! I'm a delivery moogle, kupo! Oh, I know what you're thinking.  Moogles are supposed to hide in trees and avoid contact with outsiders! Whyever would they agree to carry about letters?  \"Why\" indeed! If I had my way, I'd be curled up under the canopy of a nice oak dreaming about some beautiful mooglette with a rainbow-colored pom-pom, kupo! But no, the moon had to go and drop from the sky, causing all of that terrible commotion! Aetherytes were shattered and linkpearls rendered useless. For moons, the poor, wingless people of Eorzea had no way of communicating with each other...beyond screaming at the top of their lungs, which no one really approved of, kupo. That is, until the little horned ones asked us to assist them by delivering messages. At first we were wary of showing ourselves, worried that one of you might catch and skin us, like you do every other forest furry. But once we saw how much we were appreciated, we knew we'd found our new calling! And I personally promise to try and not read any along the way, kupo! Greetings and salutations! Wondering why I'm wearing this funny hat and toting around this oversized bag, kupo? Well, it just so happens that I had a dream the other night. A dream of moogles like me who spent their days delivering letters to travelers like you. I thought, I could do that so here I am! Should Feo Ul happen to receive any missives or epistles for you from beyond, I'll ensure that they safely find their way into your hands, kupo. Your speedy and accurate deliveries have earned you carrier level one, kupo! And yet, a delivery moogle's work is never done. Should you see the deputy postmoogle outside Limsa Lominsa's Bulwark Hall, that's your sign that we have another job for you! Your unflagging dedication to letter delivery has earned you carrier level one, kupo! I'm not certain what that means, I'm afraid, but Feo Ul insisted that I pass on the word. They also mentioned that if you're looking for more work, you should speak to the moogle who looks like me, but lives by the sea beyond. Your postal prowess has earned you carrier level one, kupo! A letter carrier's heart is a restless one, always thinking of the next job. If the deputy postmoogle has another letter for you, he'll be outside Limsa Lominsa's Bulwark Hall. Run to him, kupo. Run, don't walk! I must convey my congratulations again! Where once stood a rank amateur, now stands a veritable maestro of mail carrying, kupo. The countless postmoogles you have inspired are carrying your torch well. We may call upon you again, but until that day stay safe in your adventures! Feo Ul was saying that the delivery moogles from  beyond wherever that is, kupo have high hopes for you! I wonder if they have high hopes for me, too? Every day, I train and toil that I might one day be as peerlessly proficient at my profession as the postmoogle I met in my dreams, kupo!",

However, the course of his pastoral life was forever changed when his village of Ferndale was razed by the great wyrm Nidhogg\u2500an attack which claimed the lives of his parents and his brother.<br/>\n<br/>\nBereft of home and family, the orphan of twelve summers was taken in by Alberic, then holder of the title of Azure Dragoon. The two proceeded to forge a complicated relationship. A martial instructor, an adoptive father, and a flawed knight\u2500one who failed to protect his family. To the young Estinien, Alberic was all these things and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen his training was complete, Estinien joined the Temple Knights. So focused was he on the fight against the Dravanian Horde that he scarcely remembered the names of his companions. His sole friendship was with Aymeric de Borel, a knight of similar age who shared Estinien's passion for the cause. Estinien's prowess saw him rise through the ranks, first becoming a dragoon, and later inheriting the title of Azure Dragoon once held by his foster father.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike all Azure Dragoons, Estinien would carry with him the Eye of Nidhogg\u2500a relic torn from the wyrm's head over a thousand years ago. Though the Eye conferred power to the bearer, it rendered them vulnerable to Nidhogg's influence, and his undying hatred threatened to consume Estinien's very soul. Only through constant vigilance and strength of will did Estinien maintain a grip on his sanity\u2500though there were occasions when he came perilously close to succumbing to Nidhogg's rancor.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the midst of the Dragonsong War, Estinien offered to accompany the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud Leveilleur in their quest to convince the Dravanians to renounce their thousand-year campaign of vengeance. Though he did not believe they would succeed, Estinien nevertheless agreed to eschew violence\u2500unless circumstances forced his hand. They were later joined by Ysayle, leader of the heretics, who similarly believed peace an unlikely prospect, but one still worth pursuing in earnest.<br/>\n<br/>\nEstinien traveled with the others to the Churning Mists, where they sought an audience with Hraesvelgr, brother of Nidhogg. From the great wyrm they learned the truth of the Dragonsong War: that it was King Thordan of ancient Ishgard who drew first blood when he and his knights murdered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, and subsequently devoured her eyes so that they might claim her power for themselves. Yet in spite of this truth, the fact remained that Nidhogg was intent upon the destruction of Ishgard, and if he could not be persuaded to yield, they had but one recourse. In the end, the Azure Dragoon succeeded in hunting down and slaying his archenemy, presumably ending the thousand-year war.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon their return to the capital, Estinien and his companions discovered that Archbishop Thordan VII had plotted to wield the power of a primal to transform himself into an eternal god-king and bless the world with his twisted idea of harmony. They pursued the archbishop to Azys Lla, where they put an end to his machinations once and for all. However, in the wake of the battle, Estinien succumbed to the all-consuming hatred within Nidhogg's two eyes, transforming into a vessel for the wyrm's shade that would marshal his forces for a final assault on Ishgard. Following his defeat on the Steps of Faith, Estinien regained partial control and urged Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to kill him, but instead the two tore the eyes from his body, casting out Nidhogg's shade and saving the dragoon's life.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith his homeland entering an age of peace, Estinien renounced his title of Azure Dragoon and set off on a journey of his own. Even during these wanderings, though, he stayed abreast of the Scions' activities, and participated in both the liberation of Ala Mhigo and sabotage efforts within Garlemald. In time, he gave in to the relentless solicitations of Tataru and Krile, officially becoming a Scion and working tirelessly with his comrades to deliver the world from the calamity known as the Final Days.<br/>\n<br/>\nFollowing his long journey from archnemesis of dragons to their friend and brother, Estinien renamed his lance Nidhogg after his fallen foe. Though he is still a lone wolf at heart, he travels more often with others than before\u2500such as to the isle of Thavnair, where he has forged a new friendship with Vrtra, another of the first brood.</p>\n\n",

In the end, the Azure Dragoon succeeded in hunting down and slaying his archenemy, presumably ending the thousand-year war.  Upon their return to the capital, Estinien and his companions discovered that Archbishop Thordan VII had plotted to wield the power of a primal to transform himself into an eternal god-king and bless the world with his twisted idea of harmony. They pursued the archbishop to Azys Lla, where they put an end to his machinations once and for all. However, in the wake of the battle, Estinien succumbed to the all-consuming hatred within Nidhogg's two eyes, transforming into a vessel for the wyrm's shade that would marshal his forces for a final assault on Ishgard. Following his defeat on the Steps of Faith, Estinien regained partial control and urged Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to kill him, but instead the two tore the eyes from his body, casting out Nidhogg's shade and saving the dragoon's life.  With his homeland entering an age of peace, Estinien renounced his title of Azure Dragoon and set off on a journey of his own. Even during these wanderings, though, he stayed abreast of the Scions' activities, and participated in both the liberation of Ala Mhigo and sabotage efforts within Garlemald. In time, he gave in to the relentless solicitations of Tataru and Krile, officially becoming a Scion and working tirelessly with his comrades to deliver the world from the calamity known as the Final Days.  Following his long journey from archnemesis of dragons to their friend and brother, Estinien renamed his lance Nidhogg after his fallen foe. Though he is still a lone wolf at heart, he travels more often with others than before such as to the isle of Thavnair, where he has forged a new friendship with Vrtra, another of the first brood.",

Thus did the Verdant Path endure. It was on her deathbed, however, that she muttered these words to her successor, Velibor's father:  I have honored our promise to Gabranth, as my husband wished. His sacrifice was an act of love, to ensure that we survived. But you, my son, are not beholden to this oath. A new age is upon us...    Blaz arrived to find the Verdant Path now aligned with his own purpose, and Velibor discovered in his second cousin a kindred spirit. He remembers their first meeting, and the sense that a missing part of his soul had returned. Indeed, Velibor felt his distant relative more a brother in truth. Within a short while, they were engaged in friendly rivalry, their mutual encouragement leading to the invention of new martial techniques.  Even as their companionship blossomed, the school took steps to formalize its allegiance to the Bozjan Resistance, and Velibor, along with some few dear comrades, was invited to join the vaunted Gunnhildr's Blades. This day, as on every other, is his greatsword poised to fall upon the oppressors of his people.",

For this reason, they seek able adventurers to supplement their ranks. I am certain that your offer of aid would be well received. CHANSTELOUP Bernadette sent you to me? Hmph! Well, inexperienced or not, if you wish to prove your worth to the people of Gridania, you were right to come. You do wish to prove yourself, do you not?",

If you must know, the thought that our harvests are contributing to the war effort has been weighing heavily on my heart.<br/>\nWhat I truly wish is to be an agent of peace...but what can a humble botanist do? In the meanwhile, another order has come in from Yannie\u2500this time for zucchini, in large quantities.<br/>\nNo, I am afraid our homegrown harvest simply will not suffice. Fortunately, they are said to grow wild and in abundance in the La Noscea region.<br/>\nI would ask you to travel to eastern La Noscea, and harvest twenty of the finest zucchini you can find from the area south of Raincatcher Gully.

When you are through, bring them here to me.<br/>\nWhat resplendent zucchini! I had no idea such succulent specimens could be found in the wild\u2500truly a testament to the splendor of nature, is it not?<br/>\nThe zucchini plant is quite sensitive to humidity. One would never see them grow so large and luscious here in the Twelveswood. Furthermore, they are quick to ripen and quicker to rot, meaning that timing is of the essence.<br/>\nAnd yet a perfectly ripe zucchini is truly a thing of beauty. Sweet enough to be savored raw, its skin retains a pleasantly firm texture even when stewed.<br/>\nI suppose Yannie means to prepare a wholesome and hearty feast for our soldiers. <sigh> I know. I should take pride in serving our nation this way. But I have troubled you enough. Take your harvest to Yannie with my blessing.</p>\n\n<br/>\n<h1>YANNIE</h1>\n\n<p>Fufucha assured me my twenty zucchini were on their way. Might you be the one who took the order?<br/>\nWhy, what remarkable zucchini! I've not seen the likes of these in quite some time. At the risk of sounding boastful, I daresay that my next batch of ratatouille is shaping up to be the tastiest Gridania has ever seen!<br/>\nRatatouille is a dish that holds a special place in my heart. It was the first recipe I learned, you see, taught to me by none other than Fufucha's own mother.<br/>\nMy father was a traveling merchant, and our family moved often when I was young.

    "text_clean": "FUFUCHA Oh, good evening, . Forgive me if I seem a bit pensive. If you must know, the thought that our harvests are contributing to the war effort has been weighing heavily on my heart. What I truly wish is to be an agent of peace...but what can a humble botanist do? In the meanwhile, another order has come in from Yannie this time for zucchini, in large quantities. No, I am afraid our homegrown harvest simply will not suffice. Fortunately, they are said to grow wild and in abundance in the La Noscea region. I would ask you to travel to eastern La Noscea, and harvest twenty of the finest zucchini you can find from the area south of Raincatcher Gully. When you are through, bring them here to me. I would ask you to travel to eastern La Noscea, and harvest twenty of the finest zucchini you can find from the area south of Raincatcher Gully. When you are through, bring them here to me. What resplendent zucchini! I had no idea such succulent specimens could be found in the wild truly a testament to the splendor of nature, is it not? The zucchini plant is quite sensitive to humidity. One would never see them grow so large and luscious here in the Twelveswood. Furthermore, they are quick to ripen and quicker to rot, meaning that timing is of the essence. And yet a perfectly ripe zucchini is truly a thing of beauty. Sweet enough to be savored raw, its skin retains a pleasantly firm texture even when stewed. I suppose Yannie means to prepare a wholesome and hearty feast for our soldiers. <sigh> I know. I should take pride in serving our nation this way. But I have troubled you enough. Take your harvest to Yannie with my blessing. YANNIE Fufucha assured me my twenty zucchini were on their way. Might you be the one who took the order? Why, what remarkable zucchini! I've not seen the likes of these in quite some time. At the risk of sounding boastful, I daresay that my next batch of ratatouille is shaping up to be the tastiest Gridania has ever seen! Ratatouille is a dish that holds a special place in my heart. It was the first recipe I learned, you see, taught to me by none other than Fufucha's own mother. My father was a traveling merchant, and our family moved often when I was young. I had few friends until we moved here to Gridania, where I befriended Fufucha.
