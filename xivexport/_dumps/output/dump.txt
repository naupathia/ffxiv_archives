Barracuda Piers

<p>"Under the azure, I gazed down upon warships three, their billowing sails of crimson leaving no doubt as to who truly rules the seas." Such were the merchant's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>These docks provide safe mooring for the Thalassocratic Navy's principal squadrons, also known as the Crimson Fleet. To prevent sabotage, admittance to the area is forbidden to the general citizenry; however, on clear days, one may catch a glimpse of the armada flagship, the Triumph, from atop one of Limsa Lominsa's myriad spans.</p>

The Astalicia

<p>"A flagon or two o' grog havin' filled me 'ead with big ideas, I eyed that 'ive o' villainy from the pier, feelin' as if I could cut down Hyllfyr 'imself. Woke the next mornin' strung up by me ankles. Aye, was lucky to escape with me life." Such were the buccaneer's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Registered as a trade vessel hailing from foreign waters, this battle-scarred warship captained by the lord of the region's underworld, Hyllfyr, serves as a gathering place for brigands, cutthroats, and the purveyors of sundry other breeds of villainy. It is here that the city–state's many pirate crews find new recruits to join their ranks.</p>

Seasong Grotto

<p>"In a dank cavern that's never known the sun, the patter of the rain me only companion, I dropped to one knee and said me farewells to me ill-fated mates. They sing no songs for fishermen, but the sea swallows us all the same." Such were the old mariner's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>“I am the waves that bear, I am the winds that guide.
I am the evening stars, I am the morning sky.
I am born of the sea, and there shall I die.”

Nestled within a shallow cavern situated to the south of Summerford Farms sits an ancient monolith upon which is carved this, the Sailors' Requiem.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[LOOKOUT]

The Skylift

<p>"Backbreakin', arse-bustin' work, it is. But seein' me vessels ridin' the winds, soarin' off to far lands where me legs will never carry me─well, at least me sweat and blood ain't been for naught, eh?" Such were the laborer's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Once an endless expanse of flat, rocky meadows, middle La Noscea is now severed atwain by a sheer cliff known as the Descent. To maintain overland trade routes from the easterly outposts of Aleport and Bronze Lake, Lominsan engineers created the Skylift─a tower of wooden scaffolding outfitted with pulleys, winches, and lighter-than-air balloons.</p>

[LOOKOUT]

La Thagran Eastroad

<p>"When the skies turn grey and spirits sag, I climb high and look upon roads blazed long ago. I turn my thoughts to the hardships of my forebears till mine own worries drift away, and I find strength to carry on." Such were the sentry's words, and I would see as she saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>When the Galadion fell victim to the Navigator's fury and ran aground on the southern shores of Vylbrand seven hundred years ago, it was her two helmsmen, Jean De Nevelle and Guy La Thagran, who were tasked with exploring the newfound island─the former heading east, the latter, west. To this day, their routes still serve as La Noscea's two main thoroughfares.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[LOOKOUT]

The Salt Strand

<p>"Under the watchful gaze of the Wanderer, I cast a line to waters far below. Looking upon those pillars, grotesque and beautiful, my thoughts drift to that fateful day five years ago." Such were the fisher's words, and I would see as she saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>When struck by a fallen shard from Dalamud's outer shell, a massive amount of concentrated aether was released from just below the surface of the Rhotano Sea, immediately fusing with and crystallizing the towering fount of saltwater which was expelled during the impact. City–state-funded exploratory forays into the inner crater have all yet to return...</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[LOOKOUT]

Red Rooster Stead

<p>"No romance in the farmin' life? Balderdash, I say! Rise at dawn, climb atop the gate, and look upon the dew-kissed fields below─then tell me there's any place in the realm ye'd rather be." Such were the farmer's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>The farmers on the Red Rooster Stead will rarely shy from testing their agricultural acumen on exotic crops or untested growing methods, and take pride in their willingness to sacrifice a harvest if it means a better yield an autumn hence. The plantation's name is said to be taken from the bloody cockfights held after nightfall by the gamekeeps.</p>

[LOOKOUT]

The Brewer's Beacon

<p>"When dawn breaks, I quench the flame and pour meself an ale. I step outside, and lose meself in the blue expanse above and below─me hard-earned reward for the ships I've seen to safety, I reckon." Such were the candlekeep's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>This relatively new lighthouse was built soon after the Calamity claimed Swiftperch Tower to ensure safe passage for trade vessels carrying shipments of dark stouts and blonde barleywines out of Aleport. In addition, the candlekeeps also keep watch for increasingly frequent rogue tidal waves caused by the stirrings of the Lord of the Whorl.</p>

[LOOKOUT]

The Leatherworkers' Guild

<p>"Knew it was my calling ever since I was knee-high to a goobbue. When cloudy days sunk my spirits, I'd sneak into the guild, climb as high as my legs could carry me, and watch the tanners and tawers at work below." Such were the craftsman's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Crafters for the realm-famous Atelier Fen-Yll, the Leatherworkers' Guild boasts the finest tawers and tanners in all Eorzea. In recent years, the workshop has come to be known for its Geva patterns, which outline methods of working and cutting hides, pelts, skins, and furs in a way that honors the elementals within by minimizing waste.</p>

[LOOKOUT]

Apkallu Falls

<p>"My favoritest place is where I can see the falling water. There's a secret path that only I know. I snuck out of bed to go there last night. Mum and Dad made me promise I wouldn't climb up there anymore─you won't tell them, will you?" Such were the little boy's words, and I would see as he saw.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Named after a failed attempt by an ambitious Gridanian merchant to hatch and breed apkallus in the linn, Apkallu Falls is most remembered for serving as a place of meditation for the late Louisoix Leveilleur, Circle of Knowing Archon and hero of Eorzea.</p>
