[MOUNT]

Company Chocobo

<p>Summon your Grand Company-issued battle chocobo.<br/>
<br/>
Born and bred in the city–state of Ishgard, the majority of company chocobos are geldings of the rouncey variety; however, massive destriers and miniature Belah'dian jennets are also raised to accommodate the builds of Roegadyn and Lalafellin riders respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Chocobos are stout-<br/>
hearted creatures, but<br/>
they have their limits.<br/>
  - Mimigun</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Goobbue

<p>Use the odd-shaped horn gifted to you by the wandering minstrel to call a massive goobbue to your side.<br/>
<br/>
Traded for a song by the High Satrap of a distant land, the secret to taming these creatures once thought to be unbreakable was introduced to Eorzea by a mysterious wandering minstrel who journeyed through the realm in the final days before the Calamity.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Would that I had the<br/>
girth of a goobbue!<br/>
  - Nanamo Ul Namo</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Legacy Chocobo

<p>Five years and a realm-shaking Calamity were not enough to break the bonds between you and your loyal steed. A single whistle and he will be at your side once again.<br/>
<br/>
In the five years following your sudden disappearance from the Carteneau Flats, your ever-faithful chocobo spent each waking moment galloping across the realm in search of his lost master. His myriad adventures are nothing less than fantastical and heartbreaking...but that is a story for another day.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Go find the chocobo you<br/>
rode in on, and ride on out.<br/>
  - Sevrin</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Magitek Armor

<p>Call into battle your suit of Garlond Ironworks-modified magitek armor.<br/>
<br/>
This suit of Garlean-developed reaper-class magitek battle armor has had its original control systems purged and replaced with a new, modified core built by Cid of the Garlond Ironworks.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
At last, our very own<br/>
suit of magitek armor!<br/>
  - Cid Garlond</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Coeurl

<p>Summon your fleet-footed battle coeurl, trained from a pup to recognize you as a friend...not food.<br/>
<br/>
Native to the jungles of the Near East, coeurls were only recently introduced to Eorzea, brought over from faraway lands such as Thavnair by Ul'dahn nobles who thought to breed them as pets. Now, but a handful of skilled tamers living in recluse on the Pearl are<br/>
said to be able to train them.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Hey, good lookin'!<br/>
Catch my coeurl yet?<br/>
  - Swygrael</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Ahriman

<p>Summon forth a riding ahriman, bound to this realm with powerful magicks guaranteed to never fade.<br/>
<br/>
Though little is known of the void and the creatures which call the extra-dimensional realm home, scholars have discovered that there is a strict hierarchy amongst voidsent consisting of twelve distinct tiers. Ahrimans are believed to fall into the fifth, making them formidable foes...when not enthralled by curses.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Ye'd 'ave t' be blinder'n an<br/>
ahriman wi' an eyepatch t'<br/>
miss the camp.<br/>
  - Baderon Tenfingers</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Unicorn

<p>Summon forth the single-horned steed you befriended in the Black Shroud.<br/>
<br/>
Not long ago, Eorzean unicorns numbered in the thousands, and could oft be seen roaming the Coerthas highlands in great majestic herds that would render the mountains white as snow. Poaching has caused the population to decline, and if it were not for your act of kindness, there would be one fewer.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Your precious horses,<br/>
they're just unicorns with<br/>
a big empty forehead.<br/>
  - Chief Chocowacker</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Behemoth

<p>Summon your mighty behemoth, trained from birth to carry you...not trample you underfoot like an ant.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately following the Calamity, an adventurer returning to Gridania from Falcon's Nest in Coerthas claims to have happened upon a den of baby behemoths who had lost their mother. Despite objections from friends and family alike, she kept the beasts, eventually training them to serve as mounts.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Do not presume to<br/>
provoke the behemoth to<br/>
battle. You will die.<br/>
  - Meurise</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Cavalry Drake

<p>Summon your cavalry drake, trained by the drake whisperer of the Brotherhood of Ash.<br/>
<br/>
Training a cavalry drake is a long and arduous process that begins the moment the scalekin hatches. Never allowed to see its mother, the creature is raised solely in the presence of a drake whisperer while being weaned on the incendiary glands of aged battle drakes to ensure it is both submissive and deadly.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
You are as a lost kitten<br/>
that has wandered into<br/>
the drake's lair.<br/>
  - Zagozz Teh</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[MOUNT]

Laurel Goobbue

<p>Summon your laurel goobbue, towering friend to the sylphs.<br/>
<br/>
After having the moss and flowers growing upon his head pulled up and tossed aside like common weeds by a band of sylvan ne'er-do-wells, this quiet-mannered goobbue was taken in and cared for by the sylphs of Little Solace whose elders crafted for him a magnificent laurel with which to hide his scars.<br/>
<br/>
Tooltip:<br/>
Naught is as exhilarating<br/>
as a romp through the<br/>
forest on goobbueback.<br/>
  - Unknown</p>

[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Dodo

<p>These large, flightless cloudkin originated from the island of Mazlaya, and were brought to the mainland by Qiqirn who bred them for their eggs. The free races of Eorzea have reared the rotund creatures ever since, though they are now valued primarily for their meat. Would-be poultry farmers be warned: when seeking to defend itself, a dodo will spit forth a sleep-inducing secretion.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Tonberry

<p>Little is known about this inscrutable race of manlike creatures that inhabits the ruins of Nym─a culture that reached its peak during the Fifth Astral Era. Tonberries wear clothing and are adept in the use of complex tools, both of which would seem to suggest a civilized level of intelligence. Recently discovered texts from Nymian times suggest that the green denizens of the Wanderer's Palace are the carriers of a terrible pestilence.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Sabotender

<p>Found exclusively in arid regions, cactuars are known for their ability to survive extended periods under the scorching sun on naught but the moisture stored within their bodies. Conditioned by the brutal nature of their surroundings, cactuars are quick to defend themselves, launching a barrage of needle-like projectiles at potential predators─and the occasional unwary traveler.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Spriggan

<p>Spriggans are neither sprites nor faeries, but share similarities with both. They are known to inhabit rocky regions and the deep recesses of mines. These black-furred soulkin are famous for carrying a gem or chunk of ore about with them at all times─a custom which may explain the popularly held belief within the mining fraternity that they are bringers of good fortune. Their classification as soulkin is based on a theory expounded in the Codex of Stone, which asserts that the creatures are naught but vessels for the will of the earth.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Pudding

<p>These gelatinous creatures spawn in the agglomerations of residual matter that sometimes form in the void. Though able to mimic rudimentary sounds of speech in order to draw forth their prey, they are not thought to be especially intelligent beings. As a relatively low-ranked voidsent, flans occupy the tenth rung of the hierarchy.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Bomb

<p>This barely contained sphere of volatile gas and flame occupies the eleventh rung of the voidsent's hierarchy of twelve. Bombs must replenish their internal reserves of fuel in order to survive, and are drawn to consume any source of oil or fat that they encounter, be it plant, animal, or man. Grenades, an even more explosive species of bomb, are a place higher in the hierarchy, standing upon the tenth rung.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Mandragora

<p>The enigmatic mandragoras were first observed in the aftermath of the Seventh Umbral Era. It is not known whence they came, or if they even existed prior to the Calamity. Preliminary studies appear to suggest that the diminutive seedkin are sentient and capable of an advanced form of nonverbal communication, but further research is required to confirm these findings. The rest is mere speculation.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Coblyn

<p>The coblyn is a creature of startling appearance that skitters around on its tentacle-like appendages in search of ore. Gridanian scholars claim that a coblyn is an animal that fuses minerals to its body to create a defensive shell. Ul'dahn scholars dispute this theory, stating that these soulkin are, in fact, sentient clumps of geological matter that have adopted biological organs in order to facilitate propagation.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Morbol

<p>The morbol is a terrible beast that moves upon its slime-covered vines and roots. Highly aggressive, it kills both animals and plants with a combination of its noxious breath and ceaselessly flailing tendrils. Upon occasion, the beast will also emit a sweet-smelling gas which induces a deep sleep. Rather than rending or chewing, the fang-shaped thorns which line the morbol's maw serve to hold prey immobile during digestion.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[TRIPLE TRIAD CARD]

Coeurl

<p>Native to the regions of the Near East, these predatory quadrupeds are unrivaled in their savagery. A coeurl subdues its prey by unleashing electrical shocks from the two whip-like appendages that frame its fang-lined jaws. The feral specimens encountered in Eorzea descend from escaped war beasts once trained on a remote island at the mouth of the Rothlyt Sound known as the Pearl.</p>

2.2 A Realm Reborn Cutscenes [VoiceMan_02200]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>'Tis I. The situation may be more complicated than we anticipated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>Indeed. I shall remain watchful.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>Ere thou goest─another matter requireth thine attention. A young maiden, full eager to─</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>Wherefore inquirest thou of her fairness!? Very well. Be she damsel or devil, I shall direct her steps to Revenant's Toll.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>...Save thine insinuations for one given to such impropriety. Thou shalt not find me amenable.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>(-???-)Far across the sea, from the land of Doma, have we traveled. We seek audience with the ruler of these lands. Who here speaks for you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>We have traveled some several thousand malms across the sea, from the nation of Doma, in hopes that we might find sanctuary in these lands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>Sanctuary, Lady Yugiri?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>Aye. Lying within Othard, Doma was under the dominion of the Garlean Empire, as I am sure you are aware.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100040</h1>

<p>When the war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we espied an opportunity to free ourselves from the yoke of imperial oppression, and took up arms.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100050</h1>

<p>...Only to be crushed. And so I gathered what few Domans escaped the reckoning, and guided them hither to your shores.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100060</h1>

<p>A war of succession...? Then the Emperor... Forgive me, you said that Doma “was” under imperial rule, did you not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100070</h1>

<p>Doma is gone. Razed to the ground as an example to the other provinces.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100080</h1>

<p>Twelve have mercy... And your people?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100090</h1>

<p>On a ship anchored in Vesper Bay, flying borrowed colors.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100100</h1>

<p>Many were complicit in the rebellion, or are kin to those who were. They will not come ashore until I send word that it is safe to do so.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100110</h1>

<p>I sought an audience with your rulers, but was summarily refused.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100120</h1>

<p>The lords of Ul'dah are not wont to entertain foreign refugees without suitable encouragement.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100130</h1>

<p>Mayhap I was foolish to expect otherwise. But our supplies run low, and we have young ones in urgent need of care.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100140</h1>

<p>I have seen the tents outside the gates, however. We are not the first to seek asylum, nor will we be the last.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100150</h1>

<p>...Be that as it may, Ul'dah is no friend to Garlemald. Your tale would stir the hearts of many men and women here.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100160</h1>

<p>The sultana and the Syndicate will not be so easily swayed─but I shall see that you are granted an opportunity to plead your case.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100170</h1>

<p>This is within your power?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100180</h1>

<p>Well...far be it from me to boast, but I do have the ear of certain influential individuals.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100190</h1>

<p>I am in your debt.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100200</h1>

<p>Lady Yugiri, forgive me for observing, but...your choice of attire seems like to evoke feelings of mistrust.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100210</h1>

<p>Men are wont to fear the unfamiliar. We know this from experience.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100220</h1>

<p>We seek only to spare the people of Ul'dah unnecessary disquiet.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100230</h1>

<p>I shall defer to your experience, then.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100240</h1>

<p>I thank you for your understanding.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100250</h1>

<p>It seems I have urgent business with the Flame General. I leave our guests in your capable hands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200000</h1>

<p>I, Yugiri of Doma, am honored to meet you at last, Your Grace. To mark this auspicious occasion, I should like to present to you the finest treasures our humble nation has to offer...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>Alas, the circumstances which have brought me here today have divested me of both time and dignity. I come before you as a pauper in direst need of aid─to request that you grant my people asylum.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>I, Nanamo, seventeenth in the line of Ul, welcome you to our city. Be at ease, Lady Yugiri.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>Although I myself have heard the tale of your misfortune, I would ask that you recount it once more for the benefit of the others here present.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>As you wish, Your Grace. For many years, my nation, Doma, suffered under the yoke of imperial rule, and my people yearned to be free. Thus, when a war of succession broke out in Garlemald, we sought to take advantage of the chaos and reclaim our liberty.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>Alas, our enemy proved less preoccupied than we had hoped, and our rebellion was put down in the most brutal fashion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>Those who survived─how many do they number?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>More than two hundred souls huddle within the cramped confines of our own galleon's hold. Yet this figure accounts for but one of a number of ships which escaped the purge.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>It is my hope that you will allow us all to dwell within your walls. Should that prove unfeasible, however, I humbly ask that you accept as many of my people as your resources allow.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200090</h1>

<p>Pray understand, we do not beg a boon, but propose instead an arrangement. We would serve─as soldiers or tradesmen─until our debt is repaid.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200100</h1>

<p>What are the Syndicate's opinions on this matter?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200110</h1>

<p>I, for one, think it's a marvelous idea. Lady Yugiri and her people strike me as an industrious lot, and there are parts of the city which have yet to be fully restored. If they are willing to work, I see no reason not to let them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200120</h1>

<p>The head of the Mirage Trust is not known for his generosity. He sees profit in this.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200130</h1>

<p>I agree. That said, these are foreign refugees. To admit them would require a formal resolution. Shall we call a vote?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200140</h1>

<p>The law is the law.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200150</h1>

<p>Lord Lolorito?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200160</h1>

<p>Tell me: are you blind or willfully ignorant? Even now, our streets are choked with the displaced victims of the Calamity and Ala Mhigan refugees.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200170</h1>

<p>They live hand-to-mouth, subsisting on aid provided by the Immortal Flames─the cost of which grows ever higher!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200180</h1>

<p>The wealth of Ul'dah is not without limits, my friends.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200190</h1>

<p>And need I remind you that these refugees are prone to violence and criminal activity? You have all read the reports, I think?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200200</h1>

<p>Without homes or employment, it is only a matter of time before men grow desperate and take that which they imagine has been unjustly denied them. Yet, knowing this, you would have us swell their ranks. Mayhap you think the Brass Blades and the Flames are not hard-pressed enough?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200210</h1>

<p>Some say the chairman of the East Aldenard Trading Company passes gil thrice daily. This may explain how he came to be the wealthiest man in Ul'dah. Or it may simply be that he's ruthless beyond reckoning.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200220</h1>

<p>Surely the sultanate can support the few hundred Domans Lady Yugiri represents? That our resources have been taxed I do not deny, but we are hardly in danger of financial collapse.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200230</h1>

<p>I move that an exception be made.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200240</h1>

<p>An exception, Your Grace? I am suddenly reminded of a similar debate some years ago, regarding a number of Ala Mhigan refugees, if memory serves.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200250</h1>

<p>What were your words that day? Ah, yes: “The law is the law.” And so our visitors remained in Little Ala Mhigo.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200260</h1>

<p>Mayhap our wise and benevolent sultana would be so good as to enlighten us as to which other of our laws should not be upheld?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200270</h1>

<p>Mind your tongue, Lolorito.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200280</h1>

<p>My lord, I share your concern for the welfare of our great nation, but we must endeavor to take a longer view. You know as well as I that people can be a resource still more precious than gil.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200290</h1>

<p>Precious or not, they were never yet so reliable. And unlike those who frequent your establishment, I have no desire to gamble with my future.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200300</h1>

<p>Ul'dah's greatest asset is, and has ever been, her material wealth. We risk this at our peril.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200310</h1>

<p>One need only look to Teledji Adeledji's example for evidence of the danger in allowing sentiment to dictate policy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200320</h1>

<p>How far the vaunted Mirage hath fallen, both in repute and profitability, since he began employing refugees...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200330</h1>

<p>How I choose to conduct my affairs is not your concern, my lord!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200340</h1>

<p>A proposal has been tabled. Given its urgency, I move we forgo further debate and call a vote.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200350</h1>

<p>To accept the Doman refugees or not. Those in favor, I bid you remain. Those opposed, I bid you leave.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200360</h1>

<p>Would that it were within my power to welcome you and your people, Lady Yugiri. As you have observed, however, my authority in such matters is regrettably limited.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200370</h1>

<p>Without the consent of the Syndicate, I cannot act.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200380</h1>

<p>I understand, Your Grace. And I appreciate all that you have done on our behalf.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200390</h1>

<p>The nerve of the man... If that bastard had not forsaken the eastern trade route, Little Ala Mhigo would now be thriving.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200400</h1>

<p>That you should have traveled so far, under such dire circumstances, only to be refused in this manner is utterly unconscionable. Pray accept my sincerest apologies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200410</h1>

<p>Now that the Empire no longer poses an immediate threat, they see little reason to maintain the pretense of unity.</p>

<p>The Monetarists have grown especially defiant of late─Lord Lolorito most of all.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200430</h1>

<p>But this is neither the time nor place for that discussion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>How goes the fishing? Caught anything slippery?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>Aye. Our suspicions were well founded. The Serpent Reavers are indeed the culprits.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>The plot thickens...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>Has there been any movement in Thanalan?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>It has been blessedly quiet. Which is to say the Amalj'aa are being no more or less of a nuisance than usual, summoning Ifrit with such crystals as they have hoarded.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>Urianger, too, reports naught out of the ordinary.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>Then we have our explanation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>Your explanation for what, pray tell?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>For the recent spate of crystal thefts in Thanalan. We naturally assumed that the trail would lead us back to the Amalj'aa.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>Yet it did not. It led us across the sea unto Vylbrand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>Vylbrand...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300120</h1>

<p>There have been reports of increased Sahagin activity of late...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300130</h1>

<p>Oh gods...they mean to summon Leviathan?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300140</h1>

<p>That is the way of it, I fear.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300150</h1>

<p>Whilst conducting our investigation on behalf of the Mineral Concern, we came upon evidence implicating the Serpent Reavers.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300160</h1>

<p>With the aid of the Maelstrom, I was able to verify our suspicions. 'Tis only a matter of time before Leviathan returns to harrow the seas.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300170</h1>

<p>But there is more. One of the Sahagin─an elder, by my judgment─spoke of attaining the “gift and knowledge of eternity.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>300180</h1>

<p><moan></p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>Such a disturbance in the aether... If I did not know better, I should think this device defective.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>And there is the explanation...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>Soon! Sssoon it shall begin! Our Lord shall rise 'midst sssurging waves to wash away the finless ones!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>And I shall be granted the gift and knowledge of eternity, and with the emissary ssstand equal! Then shall I know no cesssation, no oblivion!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>...Whence comes this promise of immortality? The emissary?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>We have outstayed our welcome.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>“The gift...and knowledge.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>500020</h1>

<p>Are the two of you quite well?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500030</h1>

<p>You...you shared that vision, did you not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500040</h1>

<p>Even before the Sahagin made mention of the emissary, I recognized Elidibus's words. He is behind this.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500050</h1>

<p>But surely it is not within his power to grant the Echo?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500060</h1>

<p>My lady─unless we act swiftly, Leviathan will rise again. The Admiral has already requested that we intervene to prevent this. Failing that, we are to attend to the primal's extermination.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500070</h1>

<p>She will have our full cooperation. Let us make haste to Limsa Lominsa.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500080</h1>

<p>I mean to play a part in this mission. Tataru─pray take charge in my absence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500090</h1>

<p>My lady, are you sure this is wise?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500100</h1>

<p>I am aware of the risks. But there is something I must see with mine own eyes.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500110</h1>

<p>...The true nature of the Echo.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500120</h1>

<p>Very well. I shall not stand in your way...on the condition that you permit me to accompany you as bodyguard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500130</h1>

<p>Your company is ever welcome, Thancred.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500140</h1>

<p>I take it something ill is afoot?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500150</h1>

<p>Aye. A primal is about to be loosed upon Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500160</h1>

<p>A...primal?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500170</h1>

<p>A godlike being whose very existence is a bane upon the land. We Scions of the Seventh Dawn are sworn to put an end to their kind.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500180</h1>

<p>I see. Know then that I am learned in the arts of war. In return for the kindness you have shown my people, I would lend you my blade.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500190</h1>

<p>It would be most welcome. When contending with a primal, one can never have too many able allies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500200</h1>

<p>If you crave a more intimate understanding of the problems facing Eorzea, this experience is like to provide it. Be sure to come well prepared.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>Damn them... They have made thralls of soldiers and civilians both...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>Did I miss much?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600040</h1>

<p>Hah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600050</h1>

<p>Yah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600060</h1>

<p>So that is how you fight in the Far East? Mental note: pick no quarrel with Domans.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600070</h1>

<p>But seriously: if I am to keep up, I must needs forsake elegance for efficiency.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600080</h1>

<p>Yah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600090</h1>

<p>Hah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600100</h1>

<p>Hmmm...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600110</h1>

<p>To the aetheryte!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>You'll forgive me my lateness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>I've been something of a liability of late, I know. 'Tis high time I set about making amends.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>Pshhh! Long have you shriveled shhhorewalkers tormented our kind!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700040</h1>

<p>But no more! Your time is at an end!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700050</h1>

<p>You shall perish with sssalt in your wounds and sssea in your lungs!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700060</h1>

<p>Lord of the Whorl, hearken to our plea!<br/>
Lord of the Whorl, deliver us from our misery!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700070</h1>

<p>Do you feel that!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700080</h1>

<p>I know this sensation... It's the Echo!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700090</h1>

<p>What!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700100</h1>

<p>Pshhh! Sssuch power! It is...transcendent!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700110</h1>

<p>Seven hells...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700120</h1>

<p>Pshhhahahahahaaa! Ssstrike me down if you will! It is futile! I have massstered the gift! I am...eternal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700130</h1>

<p>O mighty Leviathan, ruler of the ssseas, born of waters primordial! I offer unto You this frail fleshhh, that You might grant Your faithful servants deliverance!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700140</h1>

<p>I beseech You! Come forth!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700150</h1>

<p>Die, damn you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700160</h1>

<p>Foolishhh shorewalker! You cannot kill that which is eternal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700170</h1>

<p>Heavens forfend...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700180</h1>

<p>Damn it all!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700190</h1>

<p>Pshhh!? My being...ebbs away... B-But it should by rightsss be infinite!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700200</h1>

<p>Am I not...immortal? Curse you, Emissary! You promised me...everlasssting... Pshhh...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700210</h1>

<p>Wh-Where did he go!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700220</h1>

<p>What say you? Nary a single ship!? Hells take that sea demon!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700230</h1>

<p>Gather the survivors and get to shore. Leave the wrecks for the pirates.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700240</h1>

<p>Leviathan wastes no time. The diversionary squadron is lost.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700250</h1>

<p>For a mercy, 'twould seem the primal now makes for open sea. But why does he not press his advantage? Unless...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700260</h1>

<p>Gods save us, he means to unleash a tidal wave!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800010</h1>

<p>There used to be a hamlet beyond South Tidegate in western La Noscea. Halfstone, 'twas called.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800020</h1>

<p>Some years prior to the Maelstrom's founding, Leviathan rose from the briny depths, and set about unleashing watery hell upon us. On that occasion, the Company of Heroes put him down before he could do too much damage.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800030</h1>

<p>But when the bastard came next, this time in the wake of the Calamity, we were not so fortunate. Weary of ravaging our shoreline, he summoned a tidal wave which fair leveled Halfstone, and washed the soil away for good measure.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800040</h1>

<p>The area was subsequently occupied by the Sahagin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800050</h1>

<p>Aye, the thrice-damned creatures transformed it into a spawning ground for their brood.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800060</h1>

<p>Given the quantity of crystals stolen to feed him and his legion of thralls, we can be fairly sure that Leviathan is stronger now than in his previous incarnations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800070</h1>

<p>If that sea demon is left to wreak havoc, what befell Halfstone may well befall a larger settlement─even Limsa.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800080</h1>

<p>That cannot happen. The primal must be stopped.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800090</h1>

<p>That was ever our objective, Admiral. But how are we to achieve it?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800100</h1>

<p>The sea is Leviathan's uncontested domain. The ships of the Third Squadron could not close to within a hundred yalms of the primal, nor could their cannons pierce his defenses.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800110</h1>

<p>I have read the reports, Master Thancred. Our warships may as well have been bloody pleasure barges for all the good they did. Seven hells... Is there no way that we might strike back?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800120</h1>

<p>The Company of Heroes defeated Leviathan having first lured him into an inlet, but we must needs contend with him upon the open sea. It will avail us little to consult past experience.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800130</h1>

<p>Admiral, if I may.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800140</h1>

<p>Speak freely, Marshal.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800150</h1>

<p>By all accounts, Leviathan's most formidable weapon is the very sea itself. Waves and whirlpools, tides and currents─all these things are his to command. The key to victory, I believe, lies in disarming our foe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800160</h1>

<p>This, in effect, is what the Company of Heroes achieved with their ruse. We cannot lure Leviathan from the sea a second time, but what if we could weaken his hold upon the element of water? I have heard of devices capable of such wonders. They draw upon the power of corrupted crystals, I am told.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800170</h1>

<p>If mounted upon a ship, such a device might be used to prevent Leviathan from bringing the full force of the sea to bear against us, rendering him no more dangerous than any other sea serpent.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800180</h1>

<p>Of course... Cid built a similar device to grant the Enterprise safe passage through Garuda's tempest, did he not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800190</h1>

<p>Begging your pardon, my lady, but to give credit where it's due, this is something I heard from an old arcanist friend of mine.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800200</h1>

<p>It makes little difference who thought of it first, so long as it works. Beg the specifications of this device from your friend, and I shall pass them on to our people at Naldiq & Vymelli's.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800210</h1>

<p>But before we proceed any further, I would voice one concern: piercing Garuda's defenses is one thing, suppressing Leviathan's attacks quite another.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800220</h1>

<p>In matters of science, I am as a babbling babe, but I cannot well imagine that such a feat would be possible without a veritable mountain of corrupted crystals.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800230</h1>

<p>The question being: do we have a ship big enough to bear such a burden?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800240</h1>

<p>Mayhap not, Admiral. But two might. Recall you the tale of Mistbeard's greatest haul? It is said that he lashed two ships together, side by side, the better to bear his plunder.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800250</h1>

<p>By your leave, we might attempt to repeat the trick. The gods know, it would be quicker than building a new vessel.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800260</h1>

<p>Mistbeard did this? Truly, Marshal, upon the subject of the pirate king, you are as a scholar.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800270</h1>

<p>Now, from what I have gleaned of these matters, the device will need to be in close and constant proximity to the target. To wit, we must lash our twin vessel to Leviathan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800280</h1>

<p>This in itself will be no small feat. Ramming speed will be required, but given the weight of the cargo, that will only be attainable with the aid of a towing vessel...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800290</h1>

<p>Suffice it to say, the task of piloting said vessel will entail considerable danger, and I would not ask it of another. I volunteer myself.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800300</h1>

<p>'Twill be dangerous for all involved...but we have no better recourse. Very well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800310</h1>

<p>Commodore. Assemble the remnants of the fleet at Moraby Bay.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800320</h1>

<p>Give priority to our soundest vessels. The repairs can wait.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800330</h1>

<p>Storm Marshal Slafyrsyn, command of the operation is yours. I want that twin vessel ready to sail posthaste.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800340</h1>

<p>At once, Admiral!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800350</h1>

<p>And then there is the small matter of slaying the beast... The fate of Limsa Lominsa rests upon your shoulders once again. Go well, Warrior of Light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>We Lominsans are sworn to strive “Till sea swallows all”─and swallow all it would have, had Leviathan prevailed. That we still strive now, we owe in no small part to you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>Not for the first time, you have delivered Limsa Lominsa from the wrath of a primal. Never has our nation known a stouter ally.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>On behalf of my people, I give you my humblest thanks.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900040</h1>

<p>'Tis meet that I give thanks to old Mistbeard, too, for his fine solution. Whatever else he may have been, 'tis clear he was a resourceful soul. Would that I had a man like him in my service.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900050</h1>

<p>Before I set foot in these lands, I had no inkling that the people of Eorzea contended with such mighty foes. Suffice it to say, their existence came as something of a shock─as did the idea that they could be defeated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900060</h1>

<p>This experience has served to remind me of the vastness of the world...and the boundless potential of man.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900070</h1>

<p>Though I am but a refugee in this realm, I would fain be of use to you in your fight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900080</h1>

<p>Know that I am tutored in one of the foremost combat arts of the Far East. It may seem...outlandish to the Eorzean eye, but should any of your people care to learn, I would be pleased to initiate them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900090</h1>

<p>And I will see to it that they are grateful. I have no doubt that your knowledge and skills will serve us well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900100</h1>

<p>Besides, your art is not so outlandish as you think. Would you not agree, Master Thancred?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900110</h1>

<p>Naught escapes your searching eye, Admiral.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900120</h1>

<p>Few are privy to this information, but Limsa Lominsa is home to a certain...secret fraternity. Its members are trained in a form of combat not unlike your own.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900130</h1>

<p>By my judgment, it should not be beyond such individuals to adapt to the techniques I witnessed you employing with such admirable deftness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900140</h1>

<p>I am heartened to hear this. I, too, noted a kinship between your style and mine own. Though it seemed to me that you fought differently in the beginning.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900150</h1>

<p>A-Aye, I suppose I did... What can I say? I am a man of many talents. Hahaha...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900160</h1>

<p>Though you may labor to believe it, Thancred was once something of a scoundrel, who fraternized with the criminal class in these parts.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900170</h1>

<p>Y-Y'shtola! You jest, of course!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900180</h1>

<p>But for a chance encounter with Alphinaud's grandsire, he might never have left Limsa Lominsa; or received an education in Sharlayan; or taken up his post in Ul'dah─which is where he trained in the blade, lest you wonder.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900190</h1>

<p>Minfilia─please!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900200</h1>

<p>It would seem there is more to you than meets the eye, Master Thancred.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900210</h1>

<p>Lady Yugiri─I am told that you and yours came to Eorzea seeking permanent resettlement, and that many Domans have since been engaged as frontier hands at Revenant's Toll. Mor Dhona is many things, but a place of refuge it is not.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900220</h1>

<p>Know that I would like nothing better than to furnish your people with a new home here on Lominsan soil. Alas, racked by instability as we are, our nation is in no fit state to take you in.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900230</h1>

<p>Yet I'll not have it said that we turned a blind eye to your suffering. Until such time as we can do more, I pledge to send provisions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900240</h1>

<p>We are in your debt, Admiral. I realize that it scarce qualifies as repayment, but if it please you, I shall set about sharing my martial knowledge with your people at once.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900250</h1>

<p>You wished a word in private.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900260</h1>

<p>The better not to spoil the festive mood.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900270</h1>

<p>History repeats itself, Admiral. As the kobolds did before them, the Sahagin resorted to summoning their god over a territorial feud. They acted in self-preservation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900280</h1>

<p>It may be that the Sahagin initiated this particular clash, but how it begins does not interest me so much as how it ends.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900290</h1>

<p>I have not forgotten our conversation, Y'shtola. I am aware that man bears part of the blame for the primals' existence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900300</h1>

<p>Nor am I ignorant of the Sahagin's reason for acting. They sought to secure a place to breed and multiply, that their kind might survive. Self-preservation, as you say.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900310</h1>

<p>But we have as much right to live and thrive as they. If our own survival is threatened, are we to lay down our arms and welcome oblivion? Nay.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900320</h1>

<p>And so you kill, that you might live. Yet if living is a right, then that right belongs to all peoples, be they men or beastmen.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900330</h1>

<p>I'll not deny your reasoning. But when a storm gathers, it falls to me to see my people safely through it. That is my duty, and I shall do it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900340</h1>

<p>As must we all, Admiral. Stay the course, then, but know that it will lead to no good end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900350</h1>

<p>Man has ever put himself first and foremost.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900360</h1>

<p>To justify his actions, he clads himself in the armor of righteousness─though it be a fancy of his own making. In this, mayhap the Garleans and we Domans are not so different...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900370</h1>

<p>Eorzea has become as a raging sea. If we are to keep our heads above the waves, we cannot scruple to drown the man next to us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900380</h1>

<p>When hopes of coexistence founder, strength must determine who has the greater right to live.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00010</h1>

<p>I have been reflecting upon the events which took place during our visit to Vylbrand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00020</h1>

<p>If you have a moment, I would share my conclusions with you. Please bear with me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00030</h1>

<p>When the Sahagin elder summoned Leviathan, he employed the power we have come to know as the Echo.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00040</h1>

<p>Though I cannot well explain the how of it, it would seem he became immortal in so doing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00050</h1>

<p>When the Admiral subsequently slew him, his spirit emerged from his lifeless flesh, a consciousness shorn of physical form.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00060</h1>

<p>Thus transfigured, he took up residence in the body of his minion with the ease of a man donning a favorite glove.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00070</h1>

<p>Long have I known that the Echo allows one to pass through the walls of a man's soul.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00080</h1>

<p>But never did I imagine that it could free us from our own flesh, nor less that our souls could then occupy the next corporeal vessel to take our fancy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00090</h1>

<p>It was of this that Elidibus spoke─an existence which knows neither cessation nor oblivion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00100</h1>

<p>And yet, though the Sahagin had mastered his gift and thereby become immortal, he was by no means invulnerable.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00110</h1>

<p>As we both bore witness, he was ultimately absorbed into Leviathan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00120</h1>

<p>And the import of this observation? If the Ascians' mode of existence is indeed the same, it can be inferred that they, too, are not invulnerable─that they can be destroyed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00130</h1>

<p>There exists a legend which tells of souls who are reborn upon the cusp of each Umbral Calamity, that they might stay the encroaching Darkness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00140</h1>

<p>To most, it is but a faerie tale, yet recent events have given me cause to wonder: could the legend in fact refer to the Echo?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00150</h1>

<p>Much and more yet remains unknown, but I am confident that all will become clear in time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00160</h1>

<p>For the present, however, what matters is that the key to defeating the Ascians may at last be within sight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00170</h1>

<p>With Urianger's aid, it is my hope that I shall fathom this matter ere long.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00180</h1>

<p>Ah! I was just about to send for you, my friend.<br/>
...Is aught amiss?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00190</h1>

<p>Grave tidings from the Sharlayan motherland, my lady.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00200</h1>

<p>It doth concern our distant allies, the Students of Baldesion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00210</h1>

<p>What of them?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00220</h1>

<p>My lady...the Isle of Val, which for many years hath been the order's home, is no more.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00230</h1>

<p>No more? Whatever do you mean?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00240</h1>

<p>I relate only that which hath been conveyed unto me by our agents. An aetheric wave of the highest magnitude was recorded in the region. Soon thereafter, 'twas observed that the isle had ceased to be.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00250</h1>

<p>'Tis postulated that a magick was evoked, like in power to Ultima.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00260</h1>

<p>Twelve preserve...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00010</h1>

<p>If there are no other matters, I move that today's meeting be adjourned.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00020</h1>

<p>It is done, my lord.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00030</h1>

<p>I... <cough> F-Forgive my impertinence, my lord, but these orders... I am uncertain as to what end they serve.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00040</h1>

[CUTSCENE]

2.3 A Realm Reborn Cutscenes [VoiceMan_02300]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>Ul'dah, on the other hand, is not. This riot was anything but an isolated incident.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>There is a restlessness in the air. Tensions long simmering are at last threatening to boil over.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>Ul'dah is a nation infamous for the great disparity between the wealthy and the poor. The majority of the populace accepts this state of affairs because they believe that every man bears responsibility for his own lot in life.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>To an Ul'dahn, money is the foremost─and some would say the only─measure of a man's worth. Small wonder that the wealthiest wield the greatest influence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>So where do the refugees fit into this social hierarchy? What place is there for those who fled Ala Mhigo and the destruction of the Calamity?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>Plainly, there is none. They have no wealth, no power, and no worth. To the Ul'dahn way of thinking, they may as well not exist.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>Choosing to ignore their existence, however, is patently not an option. General Raubahn and the sultana understand this, which is why they ordered the Immortal Flames to provide the refugees aid and succor.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>Yet none would dispute that the expenses incurred by this policy grow by the day, with no end in sight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>This has prompted more and more Ul'dahns to question their obligation to aid these worthless wanderers... </p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>While more and more refugees have come to resent their treatment at the hands of the sneering citizenry.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>The manner of Lord Lolorito's refusal to grant the Domans asylum bespoke a disdain for all refugees─an attitude shared by the rest of the Monetarists. And you may be sure they make no effort to conceal their opinions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>It was only a matter of time before the refugees united in protest. Nor is it any surprise that some among them would ultimately resort to violence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>That the Immortal Flames should choose this of all occasions to engage in joint training exercises with the other Grand Companies... By the time they return, the situation may well have deteriorated beyond mending.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>Commander Swift has kept us apprised of your recent activities. You've made great strides towards quelling the violence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>Despite our best efforts to determine what provoked this uprising, the truth continues to elude us. Have you uncovered aught which might shed some light on the mystery?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>This information does not leave this room.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100040</h1>

<p>The Syndicate's decision to reject the Doman refugees' appeal for asylum had lasting repercussions. A number of those displaced by the Calamity claimed it was proof of a policy of discrimination.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100050</h1>

<p>Together with a group of Ala Mhigan refugees, they organized a series of demonstrations to protest against the sultanate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100060</h1>

<p>Demonstrations which became heated, but did not descend into violence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100070</h1>

<p> Until a certain incident served as a call to arms.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100080</h1>

<p>A unit of Brass Blades sent to supervise a demonstration loosed arrows upon unarmed protesters.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100090</h1>

<p>It was this atrocity which prompted the refugees to take up arms. I need not tell you what followed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100100</h1>

<p>We assumed at first that the attack was born of a miscommunication. When emotions run high, they happen. But suspicions were raised regarding the unit's commanding officer, whom I ordered interrogated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100110</h1>

<p>Sure enough, our fears were soon confirmed. The dog confessed that a merchant had offered him coin to give the order─a merchant in the employ of Teledji Adeledji.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100120</h1>

<p>Teledji Adeledji?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100130</h1>

<p>But he spoke in favor of the Domans' cause, and has ever seemed sympathetic towards the refugees' plight. Why would he do such a thing?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100140</h1>

<p>Know you of the Carteneau Reclamation Bill?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100150</h1>

<p>It is a proposal to annex the Carteneau Flats so that refugees may establish permanent settlements.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100160</h1>

<p>When last I looked, that was disputed territory.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100170</h1>

<p>Aye. Some might even call it a battlefield.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>The destruction wrought by Bahamut was greatest at the Carteneau Flats. That much is common knowledge.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>What is less well known is that his rampage laid bare ancient Allagan ruins, of which no record existed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>There are certain...differences of opinion as to how these ruins should be handled, which is why each nation maintains a military presence in the region to this day.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>Yet differ though we may, we are still allies. Therefore, in the interest of preserving the Eorzean Alliance, we have reached an agreement.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>Any conflict which may arise during the course of military exercises in the region shall have no bearing on relations between our nations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>In full knowledge of this delicate state of affairs, Teledji Adeledji proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>A shameless bloody ruse which stands to benefit him in but one conceivable way.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>If successful, he will gain control over the disputed territory, under the guise of assisting in the resettlement effort. And you can be sure he'll build an orphanage next to every Allagan ruin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200090</h1>

<p>The man would threaten the unity of the Eorzean Alliance and risk countless lives for personal gain!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200100</h1>

<p>He walks a path all his own, independent of any faction, and beholden to none of his fellows on the Syndicate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200110</h1>

<p>By inciting the less fortunate to violence, he hopes to convince others that the Carteneau Reclamation Bill is the only viable solution.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200120</h1>

<p>His sympathy for the plight of the Domans was naught but posturing to gain credibility with the refugees. Of that there can be no doubt.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>Forgive me, but what could possibly motivate Teledji Adeledji to go to such lengths? What is so special about these ruins that he would risk his position on the Syndicate, and, most likely, charges of treason against the sultanate?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>Omega...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>Pardon?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>An Allagan monstrosity, not unlike the Ultima Weapon. Mayhap larger. We know not. It has yet to be fully excavated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>Allagan inscriptions indicate that it was created to fell Bahamut himself.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>If accurate, it might explain why Nael van Darnus chose to bring the red moon down upon the Carteneau Flats.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>Given the ends he went to to ensure Eorzea's annihilation, destroying the one weapon which could stay the elder primal may well have seemed like good sense.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>When first I bore witness to the power of the Ultima Weapon, I doubted the evidence of my senses... And now you tell me there is another such weapon─one which could contend with Bahamut. Bahamut.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>Aye. We were skeptical ourselves. Truth be told, until the Ultima Weapon's existence came to light, we thought the inscription had been mistranslated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>At present, Omega is more akin to a fossil than a tool of war, having long since ceased to function. As such, its true potential cannot accurately be gauged.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>However, if someone were to restore it, as the Garleans did the Ultima Weapon, I have little doubt that he would wield untold power.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300120</h1>

<p>Power enough to subjugate Ul'dah, like as not, and the rest of Eorzea besides─which is doubtless why Teledji Adeledji yearns to have it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300130</h1>

<p>That he should aspire to world domination... He who has ever walked two paces behind Lord Lolorito in matters of commerce.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300140</h1>

<p>'Tis in acknowledgement of his own limitations that he seeks this power. Woe betide us all should we allow him to have it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300150</h1>

<p>Pray waste no time chasing rats. Only a fool would believe that secrets can be kept in Ul'dah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300160</h1>

<p>It would seem the implications of the sultanate's refugee problem are rather more far-reaching than we assumed...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>The incident with the new frontier hands? No, no, you need not elaborate─I have been following their progress with no small amount of interest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>Brave men and women all... They do our nation a great service. The existence of a fortified outpost in Mor Dhona will do much to dissuade the Empire from trespassing on Coerthan soil.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>Right glad am I that you have chosen to lend your support to this endeavor. Never let it be said that House Fortemps does not acknowledge the efforts of her allies...or her debts.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>'Twas in the spirit of gratitude that I arranged for sundry supplies to be delivered to Revenant's Toll. That the shipment should chance to be waylaid by heretics is poor fortune, indeed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>Poor fortune, I say...yet not without precedent. If you would know the truth of it, these incorrigible villains grow more organized with each passing day.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>This new unity of purpose we attribute to their leader─the Lady “Iceheart.” But though I have devoted significant resources to the task of identifying this woman, we have yet to learn so much as her birth name.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400070</h1>

<p>What we do know is that the heretics speak of Iceheart in reverent tones, and would gladly embrace death rather than betray her. Such loyalty is rare indeed, and I fear to imagine what so committed a collective might achieve.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400080</h1>

<p>The brigands have not yet been so brazen as to risk direct confrontation here in Dragonhead. Some few of their number have, however, been sighted not far to the west of here...and with ever-increasing regularity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400090</h1>

<p>A visit to Whitebrim Front may bring you the answers you seek. Will you brave the snows knowing what implacable foes may lie in wait?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400100</h1>

<p>Halone's blessings be upon you! Though I take no pride in the admission, many of mine own countrymen are not so well suited as you adventurers to dealing with such foes. Were they dragons, it might be otherwise!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400110</h1>

<p>But truly, I could not wish for a finer ally. You have done much for my house in the past, and I have no doubt but that I shall have cause to celebrate your deeds again ere long.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400120</h1>

<p>Should you learn aught of value, pray return to me forthwith. A warm hearth and a warmer welcome shall be waiting for you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>(-???-)Hmph...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>Your return is most timely. Of their own accord, my thoughts had turned to your task and the progress thereof. I confess, my imaginings tended toward the grim and bloody.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>But you are here now, and I suspect such frivolous wonderings do little justice to the reality of your travails. Tell me, what did you learn of Iceheart?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>...Indeed. And this transpired at Snowcloak?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600040</h1>

<p>Of all the highlands, that towering wall has borne the worst of the region's brutal shift in climate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600050</h1>

<p>So inhospitable has Snowcloak become that we have still to survey the area in its entirety. Could its frozen heights conceal the heretics' hideaway? Mayhap a more robust reconnaissance effort is in order.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600060</h1>

<p>Putting such considerations aside for the moment, we still know far too little of this Iceheart. That she is capable of commanding such a band of fanatics bespeaks natural authority, and no small measure of charisma.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600070</h1>

<p>As much as I would like to fathom this mystery with you, the situation has grown beyond my personal purview. I am bound by duty to inform the Temple Knights and request that they bring this matter to its conclusion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600080</h1>

<p>Given the glowing reports their new commander has garnered thus far, I am certain that they can be relied upon to take appropriate action.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600090</h1>

<p>Though Iceheart's true identity yet eludes us, you have provided us with a point from which to begin. Sometimes it takes but a single stone to prompt an avalanche.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600100</h1>

<p>On the matter of the stolen provisions, I have already made arrangements for a second shipment to be sent to Revenant's Toll. I could not well allow such an honorable venture to be undermined by one miserable setback!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>Scions of the Seventh Dawn, on behalf of the people of Gridania, I bid you welcome. Your presence is of great comfort to us all in these days of uncertainty.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>I summoned you here to share tidings of a most urgent nature. But a short while ago, the great elemental spoke, and his voice was clarion in its intensity: Ramuh is returned unto the forest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>Scarce had his words ceased to echo in mine ears when we were visited by an emissary from Little Solace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700050</h1>

<p>Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700055</h1>

<p>Our guest informs us that the sylphs, too, have sensed the presence of the Lord of Levin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700060</h1>

<p>Though his exact whereabouts remain unknown, we may safely assume that the primal was summoned within the heart of the Sylphlands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700070</h1>

<p>Unlike the other primals you have encountered, Lord Ramuh is no raging avatar of destruction. He is revered as much for his wisdom as his strength, serving as both arbiter and guardian to his children. Given that we and the sylphs found a way to share the Twelveswood, it is my hope that this sagely immortal will be amenable to reason, and that conflict may be avoided.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700080</h1>

<p>Blessed as you are with the power of the Echo, you are one of the few among us who may commune with a primal without fear of influence. I would ask therefore that you represent us in this most delicate of negotiations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700090</h1>

<p>The Twelveswood has suffered enough. Upon this, we and the sylphs─and I would venture Lord Ramuh himself─are in perfect accord. Let us not endanger our shared home by engaging in unnecessary hostilities.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700100</h1>

<p>Dear friend, I beseech you: safeguard the peace which exists between our peoples.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700110</h1>

<p>You have my thanks.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700120</h1>

<p>Pray make for Little Solace, then. A member of the Order of the Twin Adder awaits you there. He will advise you on how to find the Lord of Levin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700130</h1>

<p>An ill wind blows through the forest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700140</h1>

<p>Yet...it is not only the Twelveswood that flinches at its coming─all the lands of Eorzea shiver in dread anticipation. Have care.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800010</h1>

<p>Thine aura betrays thee, servant of Hydaelyn.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800020</h1>

<p>Thou art the Bringer of Light...bane of Ifrit, Titan, Garuda, and Leviathan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800030</h1>

<p>I am Ramuh, guardian of the children of the forest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800040</h1>

<p>Thou tramplest upon sacred soil, Bringer of Light. By what right doth man intrude in this sanctuary of the sylphs?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800050</h1>

<p>The Gridanians proffer peace? Their words are born of delusion─thine offer, an insult.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800060</h1>

<p>Thou speakest of harmony, yet carest naught for my children's desires. They did but wish to dwell beneath these boughs in solitude─yet even that was too much to ask of man.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800070</h1>

<p>Thus did they turn to me for succor. The sentence I pronounce upon thy kind is just.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800080</h1>

<p>Gridanian or Garlean, it matters not. The good intent of one excuseth not the misdeeds of the other.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800090</h1>

<p>Thy conflicts have brought naught but anguish and misery unto the forest. All blame doth lie with the darkness that resideth in the breast of man.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800100</h1>

<p>Whence sprung this calamitous seed? In the beginning, no such duality existed. Were light and dark given form when man was born?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800110</h1>

<p>It would explain much. Not least why strife and sorrow follow ever in thy wake. Thou canst not deny the urgings of thine own nature.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800120</h1>

<p>Knowing that thy mere presence here portendeth tragedy, wilt thou persist in this pretense of peacemaking?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800130</h1>

<p>Thou bearest the crystal which I bestowed upon my wayward charges. That they should entrust so precious a gift to thee...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800140</h1>

<p>Thou standest apart from thy kin. Thou art the Bringer of Light, aye...but there is something more in thee...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800150</h1>

<p>Very well, I shall consider thy proposal...shouldst thou survive my trial.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800160</h1>

<p>If thou wouldst champion the cause of harmony, I must have proof that thou art fit to play the role. Weather mine ire, and prove to me thereby that thou hast strength enough to stay the Darkness which threateneth to consume thee.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800170</h1>

<p>Yet if thou shouldst be found wanting, know that all men shall perish in the storm of my judgment!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800180</h1>

<p>Come to me, Bringer of Light. I shall await thee on the field of battle!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800190</h1>

<p>Urianger. It is rare indeed to find you so far from a tome.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800200</h1>

<p>The Lord of Levin himself... Never till this day had I looked upon his visage save in painted renderings, made faint by time... Ever shall this scene remain etched in my mind's eye... Ahem. Beg pardon, my lady.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800210</h1>

<p>I must beg thine aid on a point of research. If thou art resolved to face Lord Ramuh, I would ask thy leave to observe the event...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>I have taken thy measure, Bringer of Light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>And I judge thee a worthy champion. The task of excising the sin that hath taken root in man's heart is thine.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>Shrink not from employing thy strength in service to the forest, and the wider realm beyond. Like hungering shadows do the enemies of harmony gather, and meekness will but feed them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900040</h1>

<p>If man is to be delivered from the Dark, it shall be by thy guiding Light alone. Stray not from the path, for if thou dost, thy people shall be truly lost...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900050</h1>

<p>Thou hast slain the Lord of Levin. A regrettable act...but a necessary one.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900060</h1>

<p>In witnessing thy struggle, a truth hath been revealed unto me. If I mistake not, it may yet prove a chink in the eternal armor of the Ascians.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900070</h1>

<p>But let us conclude our present business. I shall expound upon my findings at the Rising Stones anon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00010</h1>

<p>You are returned to us, dear friend, and none the worse for bearing the heavy burden which I did press upon you. Most glad am I of this.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00020</h1>

<p>I am informed that your efforts to negotiate a peace with Lord Ramuh ended in conflict. Pray tell me, what befell?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00030</h1>

<p>Ramuh made trial of you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00040</h1>

<p>I fear there is truth to his claim. It is the darkness within us that attracts the Darkness without.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00050</h1>

<p>It cannot be denied that misfortune follows man. For evidence, one need only look to the conflict brewing in Carteneau, or to the rising flood of refugees.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00060</h1>

<p>Our shared struggle against the Empire should have served to seal our union, yet the ties which bind the Alliance strain under the weight of gross self-interest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00070</h1>

<p>As the scars of the Calamity begin to fade, so too does our sense of common purpose.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00080</h1>

<p>Yet now is scarce the time to forget our shared responsibility. If this new-sprung realm is to survive beyond its infancy, it must needs be nurtured by all.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00090</h1>

<p>Eorzea must be as one. Yet I fear that dream is still far off.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00100</h1>

<p>On behalf of the people of Gridania, and the elementals both, I thank you for all that you and your fellow Scions have done.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00110</h1>

<p>Full oft have I been compelled to look to you for aid of late...and offered all too little in return. As leader of this nation, I shall endeavor to prove a more worthy ally to your cause henceforth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00120</h1>

<p>Lord Ramuh has departed, yet the keening of this ill wind grows no less insistent...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00130</h1>

<p>Voices of the forest─pray speak and I shall listen. What unseen evil begets this unease in my heart?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00010</h1>

<p>If everyone is ready, let us begin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00020</h1>

<p>Urianger, the floor is yours.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00030</h1>

<p>As all here assembled now know, in its final hours as our order's headquarters, the Waking Sands did play host to a most unexpected visitor. I speak of the Ascian clad in white, Elidibus.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00040</h1>

<p>Unwelcome though his presence was, his words that day did serve to confirm a truth long suspected: that the Ascians are eternal beings, to whom physical destruction is as a temporary inconvenience.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00050</h1>

<p>In the intervening time, Urianger and I have striven to discover a means by which the Ascians might more permanently be slain.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00060</h1>

<p>And 'tis my belief that we have found the thread that will allow us to unravel the twisted skein of their existence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00070</h1>

<p>In the moments prior to Leviathan's most recent manifestation, the Sahagin elder who summoned him was observed to undergo some manner of ascension.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00080</h1>

<p>The aetheric readings taken by Y'shtola at the time of this transfiguration have proven most enlightening.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00090</h1>

<p>The disruption to the flow of aether was sudden and dramatic. So tangible was the agitation, I scarce had need of my goggles.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00100</h1>

<p>The significance of Y'shtola's readings might better be understood in the context of mine own, taken at the instant of the Lord of Levin's demise. Unlike the primal, the Sahagin was not subject to aetheric dissipation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00110</h1>

<p>Before discussing our new discoveries, it may benefit us all to recall what we know of aetheric behavior.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00120</h1>

<p>Let us begin at what some might call the end. When we who dwell in the material realm die, our spirits dissolve into the flow of aether, and are returned to the aetherial realm.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00130</h1>

<p>In turn, the restless energy which suffuses that plane streams back into our world, giving rise to new life.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00140</h1>

<p>'Tis as the heavens did decree─the way of all mortal souls.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00150</h1>

<p>'Twixt this world and the next do the aetherial currents swirl, bearing the very essence of life. Thus doth the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth continue unabated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00160</h1>

<p>Primals behave somewhat differently. In order to manifest and then maintain a physical presence in this realm, they must consume vast quantities of aether, most often in the form of crystals. Though they may seem to live, their flesh is but aether given shape.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00170</h1>

<p>Thus, a defeated primal leaves behind no broken corpse─rather, the essence of its form seeps back into the land whence it came, and the energy of its shattered spirit is called back to the aetherial realm.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00180</h1>

<p>And there it waiteth till next the prayers of the faithful do draw it forth from the sea of aether to take their offering of crystals and make for itself a new body...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00190</h1>

<p>Which brings us on to the third group. These so-called “immortals.” They exist in a manner all their own.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00200</h1>

<p>Quite. Even as the Sahagin elder fell to the Admiral's musket shot, I witnessed the release of an aetherial cloud which immediately took possession of a nearby minion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00210</h1>

<p>A soul that dissipateth not upon the death of the flesh...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00220</h1>

<p>The secret of life everlasting. And in the claws of a Sahagin, no less. But I wonder: what would happen to one of these obstinate spirits should there be no suitable host for it to claim?</p>

<p>If mortal death entails a return to the aetherial realm, it seems doubtful that the soul of an immortal would venture there.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00240</h1>

<p>Nay, it merely withdraweth a distance. Unto the shore of the aetherial sea, perchance, but no further.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00250</h1>

<p>Yes, it exists in neither this realm nor the next, abiding instead in the space that lies between them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00260</h1>

<p>The Ascians took control of Thancred by means of a Crystal of Darkness─an artifact which, if our theories are correct, serves as a gateway to the place I have just described.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00270</h1>

<p>I was hoping people had forgotten about that...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00280</h1>

<p>I am sorry, my friend.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00290</h1>

<p>For a mercy, the weary road of our research hath brought us unto an answer.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00300</h1>

<p>The Sahagin ascended to an immortal state, but he did not possess a Crystal of Darkness through which to flee this realm. Thus was he consumed by Leviathan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00310</h1>

<p>If we could entrap the spirits of defeated Ascians in like manner, and thereby deny them resurrection...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00320</h1>

<p>Therein lieth the path to victory. Thou art most perceptive, my lady.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00330</h1>

<p>Only when we have trapped the bodiless soul within an aetherial prison can we hope to defeat its unnatural constancy. Thus, might even an eternal Paragon be consigned to oblivion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00340</h1>

<p>These feats are, of course, far easier said than done. At present, we lack a viable means to entrap and extinguish an Ascian soul.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00350</h1>

<p>Yet I believe it to be possible. The pieces of the puzzle lie before us─we have but to put them together.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00360</h1>

<p>I will depart at once to convene with the sages of Sharlayan. Together shall we divine the steps by which our goals may be achieved.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00370</h1>

<p>I have the utmost faith in you, Archon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00380</h1>

<p>Beg pardon, Antecedent, but I would raise one final matter... Even now, a Sharlayan survey party seeketh to ascertain the fate of the Students of Baldesion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00390</h1>

<p>Their findings shall soon be known to us. Though you harbor feelings of dread, I bid you surrender not to sorrow, but abide instead in hopeful prayer.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00400</h1>

<p>I shall, Archon. Thank you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00010</h1>

<p>Tell me, General: what think you of Alphinaud's bold endeavor?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00020</h1>

<p>I think it is more than bold, Your Grace. His organization would pave the way for a united Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00030</h1>

<p>Well do I understand his impatience. Since facing the common threat of the Ultima Weapon, our nations have seemed farther apart, not closer together.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00040</h1>

<p>Considering the many problems we face, should we not be glad that someone else is taking the initiative?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00050</h1>

<p>We have all pledged our cooperation, yet the grumbling continues behind closed doors. Ul'dah is not alone in her duplicity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00060</h1>

<p>I myself have doubts as to the good this organization will achieve.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00070</h1>

<p>With the inclusion of the finest soldiers of the three Grand Companies, it promises to be a fearsome military body. But whom will it serve? Even under the watchful gaze of the Scions, it is not unthinkable that such a force could perpetrate a great wrong.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00080</h1>

<p>Does it not concern you that a significant proportion of its financial backing came from the coffers of the Syndicate? That those unprincipled worms might forge this extraordinary gathering of warriors into a private army?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00090</h1>

<p>I have trust in the Scions, Your Grace. They have spared us no end of trouble at the hands of the primals. If they seek reinforcements, I deem it unwise to deny them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00100</h1>

<p>As for their finances, full many gave generously. And though our nobles proffered a sizable sum, their coin did not spill from the pockets of Lolorito and his cronies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00110</h1>

<p>And what of the presence of our stalwart adventurer friend in this endeavor? I doubt the Warrior of Light would betray our cause.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00120</h1>

<p>Yes, there is that, I suppose.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00130</h1>

<p>Yet I have known people to change. Whether we will or no, the events of the age hurl us this way and that, like a dust devil skipping across the sands...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00140</h1>

<p>Can naught be done about Teledji?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00150</h1>

<p>I have explored all avenues available to us, Your Grace, but as Ul'dahn law now stands, we lack the evidence to convict him of any crime. To arrest him on spurious grounds would only play into his hands...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00160</h1>

<p>He has all but committed treason, and yet we can do nothing!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00170</h1>

<p>Then what good our government!? What worth the royal house!? How deplorable this mockery of justice!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00180</h1>

<p>This isn't the text you're looking for.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00190</h1>

<p>Have faith, Your Grace. It is not over...</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00010</h1>

<p>Comrades! Your presence here this day signifies the momentous choice that each of you has made.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00020</h1>

<p>With your strength now pledged to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, you are beholden to no single nation. You stand as the vanguard for a united Eorzea!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00030</h1>

<p>From this moment forth, I declare you Crystal Braves! Let us mend this fractured realm, and face our enemies as one!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00040</h1>

<p>Whether it be the beastmen and their primals, or the conflict in Carteneau, it is plain that the nations of Eorzea cannot solve the problems which plague the realm. Thus does it fall to some few heroic souls to succeed where they have failed!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00050</h1>

<p>Come! Take your place at the Scions' side as guardians of Eorzea! And together we shall fight for the freedom of all!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00060</h1>

<p>(-Crystal Braves-)For the freedom of all!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00070</h1>

<p>A rousing speech, Alphinaud. Or should I say, Crystal Brave Commander Leveilleur?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00080</h1>

<p>Please, Antecedent...the title is honorary. I shall not be “leading the troops into battle,” as it were.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00090</h1>

<p>We are of the same purpose. Let us join hands, and do what must be done to save this land.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00100</h1>

<p>The Scions stand ready!</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00010</h1>

<p>I'm eager to see what the Crystal Braves might accomplish. This shall prove an interesting time indeed for the Scions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00020</h1>

<p>Yes, I'm listening.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00030</h1>

<p>So, our worst fears are confirmed. The entire isle... Such power defies comprehension...</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00040</h1>

<p>Truly!? Krile is alive!? Thank the Twelve...</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00050</h1>

<p>...I see. Pray inform me if her condition changes. Yes. I shall pass on your words to Urianger.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00060</h1>

<p>My thanks. I shall contact you anon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00070</h1>

<p>When I learned of the loss of the Isle of Val, I dared not hope that my friend had survived. Yet by some miracle, it would seem she has. She's still to regain consciousness, it is true, but better that than death.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00080</h1>

<p>Putting this happy news to one side, we must now endeavor to make sense of the readings taken by the survey party.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00090</h1>

<p>It appears the aetheric disturbance which accompanied the isle's destruction is of a magnitude alarmingly close to that of Ultima. Could the Ascians be responsible for this devastation as well?</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00100</h1>

<p>I wonder... Have you heard aught from the Mothercrystal since the battle with the Garleans?</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00110</h1>

<p>Then She speaks to neither one of us. Hydaelyn's silence portends naught but ill, I fear. </p>

<br/>
<h1>E00120</h1>

<p>Louisoix... I pray you yet watch over us...</p>

[CUTSCENE]

2.4 A Realm Reborn Cutscenes [VoiceMan_02400]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>...Commander Leveilleur bade you serve us?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>These are welcome tidings indeed. Given the sensitive nature of the task, I could not rely on one of my own.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>That which I am about to tell you, I tell you in the strictest confidence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>Some days ago, we received certain documents from an anonymous source. They notified us of the presence of a Garlean agent within the ranks of one of the Grand Companies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>Following some discreet inquiries, we identified a suspect among the Immortal Flames whom we detained for questioning.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>Alas, the man was not our agent. He was but one of many men in the agent's employ.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>We pressed the traitor for a name, but he had none to give. He claims never to have met his master, whom he knows only as the Ivy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>He was, however, certain that this “ivy” had coiled itself around every part of the Immortal Flames. It would seem our quarry joined the company some time ago, and gradually recruited others to his cause.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>These conspirators are the vines by which he learns our secrets, all without exposing himself.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>It won't be easy to identify the Ivy amidst this tangled mass of subterfuge. But we have a tendril in our hands, and we shall follow it all the way to the gnarled root.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>Now, much as I would prefer to proceed with due discretion, circumstances demand that this matter be settled posthaste.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>Garlemald's war of succession nears its end, and it is feared that the Empire will soon resume its march on Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>When it does, we can ill afford to have traitors in our midst. The Ivy must be rooted out now.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>We must begin by apprising General Raubahn of our findings. I would ask that you accompany me to the Hall of Flames, and remain on hand to see that things go smoothly.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000160</h1>

<p>Assuming the Ivy's tendrils are as widespread as we believe, he will be aware that an investigation is underway. And if that is the case, he may well move against us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000170</h1>

<p>We must be prepared for anything, while taking care not to betray our purpose by seeming prepared. A simple enough task for a one-woman army like you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>Well, well. What brings you here, my friend?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100011</h1>

<p>She is here at my behest. Greetings, Raubahn. It has been a while.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>Ilberd, you old scoundrel! When they told me you'd be visiting, I scarce believed my ears!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>But look at you! The honored captain of the Crystal bloody Braves! Who'd have imagined, eh?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100040</h1>

<p>Not many. But fewer still would have imagined your destiny lay in politics, old friend.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100050</h1>

<p>Aye...we've both come far, have we not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100060</h1>

<p>Lest you wonder, Ilberd and I go back a long way. We've been friends and rivals since we were lads.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100070</h1>

<p>The last time we saw each other, Ala Mhigo had just fallen, so you can guess how many summers it's been. And in all that time, not a word from the fool!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100080</h1>

<p>Ah, well, my dealings tended toward the modest and mundane...unlike some I could mention.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100090</h1>

<p>As I hear it, no sooner did you reach Thanalan than the Brass Blades clapped you in irons and dragged you off to die on the bloodsands. But being a stubborn sort, you won a thousand matches, and earned yourself a place in the people's hearts while you were about it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100100</h1>

<p>Then, with your mountain of prize money, you bought the Coliseum, and secured a seat on the Syndicate. Thal's balls, brother─rags-to-riches does not do it justice! You're a hero to the common man!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100110</h1>

<p>Bah, spare me. I am no hero. If anyone is worthy of that title, it's our friend here. Next to her, I'm little more than a glorified butcher.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100120</h1>

<p>But you, Ilberd─you sell yourself short. By all accounts, you were an adventurer of some standing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100130</h1>

<p>I like to think that I did my part for the greater good. But if you are no hero, then I am no adventurer─not in this company. Anyway...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100140</h1>

<p>I have tidings.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100150</h1>

<p>So there has been progress.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100160</h1>

<p>I've let it be known that this meeting is a reunion between old friends. None will give your visit a second thought.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100170</h1>

<p>To convene elsewhere would only attract attention. Let us speak here, in plain view of all.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100180</h1>

<p>...So it is we who have been compromised.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100190</h1>

<p>Teledji Adeledji's machinations have shaken Ul'dah to her foundations. In such uncertain times, a man's loyalty may be bought for a fistful of gil...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100200</h1>

<p>But if this snake has truly been in our midst for as long as you say, we must needs consider a far graver possibility: conspiracy. Could it be that the Monetarists have been in league with the Empire from the first?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100210</h1>

<p>Very well. I will have my most trusted men investigate the matter. Continue your inquiries in the meantime.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100220</h1>

<p>It does me well to see you again, old friend. When next we meet, let it be over a flagon of ale.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100230</h1>

<p>I look forward to it. Let us reminisce of bygone days, and drink to the future of our homeland.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100240</h1>

<p>Flame General... You wear the mantle well, old friend. I must work hard if I'm to keep up.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100250</h1>

<p>Well, it would seem your services were not required after all. I daresay we have Raubahn's prudence to thank for that. Still, I was glad of your presence. My thanks, Scion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>Have faith, my friend. You need only state your case with confidence and clarity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>(-???-)Commander Leveilleur. It is both an honor and a pleasure to meet you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>I am Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>Alphinaud Leveilleur, at your service.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>Your reputation precedes you, Ser Aymeric. I think we will find that we have much in common.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>Speaking of reputations, yours towers over us all. Does it not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>(-Taciturn Temple Knight-)It does indeed, Lord Commander.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>I am not too proud to admit that I have followed your activities with an interest bordering on fascination.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>Full glad was I to learn that you would be joining us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>Now then, shall we begin?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300120</h1>

<p>We know full well that the Garleans will return in force ere long.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300130</h1>

<p>What is more, we have yet to achieve a lasting victory over the primal menace. The beast tribes continue to summon their gods, and each incarnation is stronger than the last.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300140</h1>

<p>Ishgard is not immune to these threats. I must reiterate that it would behoove your nation to rejoin the Eorzean Alliance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300150</h1>

<p>Once again, I must respectfully disagree.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300160</h1>

<p>On what grounds?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300170</h1>

<p>Despite their presence in Coerthas, the Ixal do not concern us. Their territorial claims pertain to Gridanian lands, and it is the people of Gridania whom they harry.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300180</h1>

<p>Consequently, the Holy See judges this to be a Gridanian affair, and Ishgard does not intervene in the internal affairs of other nations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300190</h1>

<p>Even were that not the case, our forces are wholly committed to the Dravanian conflict. We have not the knights to spare.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300200</h1>

<p>As for the Garleans, we are not ignorant of history. We have observed the rise and expansion of the Empire, and we agree that it is only a matter of time before they resume their campaign in Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300220</h1>

<p>Then surely it would be in our best interests to present a united front?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300230</h1>

<p>Mayhap one day, but not yet.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300240</h1>

<p>Gaius van Baelsar is dead, and the legion of conscripts he left behind lacks the will to fight. We think it highly unlikely that they will emerge from behind the walls of their castra for some time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300250</h1>

<p>Forgive me, but if Ishgard's position has not changed, why did you agree to this meeting?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300260</h1>

<p>It was not only as a representative of Ishgard that I came here.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300270</h1>

<p>Pardon?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300280</h1>

<p>It is not within my power to change Ishgardian policy, regardless of my personal feelings. There is, however, one area in which I may exert a measure of influence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300290</h1>

<p>Concerns have been raised over the supplies House Fortemps has offered to Revenant's Toll. These have led to calls for restrictions on the provision of aid to foreign powers.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300300</h1>

<p>I can ensure that the shipments continue unabated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300310</h1>

<p>Ser Aymeric, we would be in your debt!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300320</h1>

<p>No, you would not, for I require something in exchange.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300330</h1>

<p>Of late there has been a flurry of Dravanian activity, the purpose of which was not immediately clear.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300340</h1>

<p>However, our astrologians have since observed alarming changes in the heavens. The dragon star waxes unnaturally bright, and there are whispers that it portends the resurrection of Midgardsormr.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300350</h1>

<p>The fallen guardian of Silvertear Falls? That's absurd.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300360</h1>

<p>Full many times have I gazed upon the dragon's corpse, still wound around the Agrius, and wondered how different our world might be if it yet lived to plague the skies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300370</h1>

<p>I do not know, and I do not wish to know. Nor does any son of Ishgard. Yet the mere presence of Dravanian forces is not sufficient grounds to send knights to Mor Dhona, whatever our astrologians say. As I told you before, we have not the forces to spare.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300380</h1>

<p>...But we do. So, you will intervene on our behalf if we agree to watch over the Keeper of the Lake.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300390</h1>

<p>Do you accept these terms?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300400</h1>

<p>I do. I will see that you are kept abreast of any developments.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300410</h1>

<p>I regret that we could not come to a similar agreement on other matters, but I understand that you are not at liberty to make such decisions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300420</h1>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope that what we have accomplished here today will serve to demonstrate to your countrymen that we can work together towards a common goal. Mayhap one day we shall look back on this moment as the first step towards a united Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300440</h1>

<p>Mayhap we shall, Commander.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300450</h1>

<p>What is the meaning of this!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300460</h1>

<p>The caravan, my lord! It's been attacked!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300470</h1>

<p>It was Iceheart, my lord!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300480</h1>

<p>What!? By the Fury! All our precautions were for naught!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>(-???-)The tales do not do you justice, Warrior of Light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>(-???-)Yes, I know who you are. And you know who I am.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I was given the name Ysayle, but I earned the name Iceheart.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600040</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)This endless cycle of hatred, of bloodshed, of sorrow─ You would see it continue, O noble Warrior of Light?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600050</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I would not. I will not. I will bring an end to this war between dragon and man─no matter the cost.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600080</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)In time, you will come to understand that what we do, we do for the greater good.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600090</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)For Eorzea. For Hydaelyn.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>Change has come to the Garlean Empire, and we must discuss the implications.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900011</h1>

<p>The rumors are true then? The war of succession is ended?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>It is. A new emperor reigns in Garlemald.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>Who!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900040</h1>

<p>The birth and all-too-rapid expansion of the Garlean Empire is commonly attributed to the strategic brilliance of Solus zos Galvus, yet he did not rule alone. Several members of the royal household also distinguished themselves during his reign.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900050</h1>

<p>Nevertheless, it was the eldest son who stood to inherit the throne─until his most untimely passing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900060</h1>

<p>I thought us fortunate when I learned that the Emperor had died without naming a successor.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900070</h1>

<p>Would that the Garlean Empire had died with him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900080</h1>

<p>'Twas the grandson and his uncle who had the strongest claims, was it not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900090</h1>

<p>Indeed. Yet claims count for little without the power to assert them. High Legatus Varis yae Galvus is a respected military leader─not so, his uncle.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900100</h1>

<p>So, young Varis has torn the crown from his uncle's grasp, and taken his place at the head of the Empire.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900120</h1>

<p>Given the troubled nature of his succession, the new emperor will require time to seal his grip on power. Yet have no doubt but that he shall, for there are none left with strength enough to oppose him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900130</h1>

<p>Since the success of Operation Archon, the remnants of the XIVth Legion and the forces occupying Ala Mhigo have done naught but fortify their positions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900140</h1>

<p>But you can be sure they'll be ready to march on us again, if their emperor gives the word.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900150</h1>

<p>When, not if. They say this Varis was so set upon Eorzean annexation that he spoke out against the Meteor project.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900160</h1>

<p>Plainly, the new emperor's intentions are of great concern to us all.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900170</h1>

<p>I propose that we set aside the Carteneau dispute for the present and discuss what measures the Alliance might take to prepare for a resumption of hostilities with Garlemald.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900171</h1>

<p>Moreover, I move that we reexamine the question of how our former allies in Ishgard might be persuaded to retake their place at our side. Could Eorzea but stand as one, 'twould deal a grave blow to our enemy's ambitions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900180</h1>

<p>Well, I suppose we should be grateful that they have finally acknowledged the inevitability of imperial attack. Who knows, they may even do something about it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900190</h1>

<p>If only the leaders of Ishgard would follow their example, and stop hiding behind their gates, praying for the coming storm to pass them by.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900200</h1>

<p>But that is a discussion for another time. At present, I am more concerned by the fact that the Alliance's mooted preparations will be made known to the Garleans many moons before their coming.</p>

<p>So long as the Ivy eludes our grasp, no secret is safe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00010</h1>

<p>(-???-)Minfilia, am I right?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00020</h1>

<p>None other. I bid you welcome to Revenant's Toll, and thank you for traveling so far on such short notice.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00030</h1>

<p>(-???-)Hah! As if I could ever say no to Urianger!</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00040</h1>

<p>Moenbryda is an accomplished Sharlayan scholar and an authority on aetheryte technologies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00050</h1>

<p>She has played an invaluable role in our search for a means to capture Ascian souls.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00060</h1>

<p>Charmed, I'm sure.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00010</h1>

<p>Everyone, if I could have your attention!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00011</h1>

<p>We have with us an esteemed guest who is come from Sharlayan to assist us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00020</h1>

<p>Moen! Gods, it's been ages!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00030</h1>

<p>Oh, longer, sister!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00040</h1>

<p>A joyous reunion indeed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00050</h1>

<p>Well, of course it is! Moen and I are like twin sisters!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00060</h1>

<p>...Save in appearance and aptitude.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00070</h1>

<p>Everyone, please!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00080</h1>

<p>I bid Moenbryda join us here that she might share with us her extensive knowledge of aetherytes.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00090</h1>

<p>Also, as many of you are already aware, she has been overseeing our research into white auracite─a sample of which she has been good enough to bring with her.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00110</h1>

<p>Well, I had to come, didn't I? You'd have to be bloody daft to turn your nose up at a chance like this. Where better to conduct my final tests than a land so steeped in aether you can taste it!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00120</h1>

<p>'Tis plain the passage of the years hath done little to dampen thy youthful spirits...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00130</h1>

<p>...And nothing at all to reform thy youthful manner.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00140</h1>

<p>Urianger! Where in the hells've you been hiding?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00150</h1>

<p>Un...unhand me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00160</h1>

<p>I come all this way, and that's what you have to say to me!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00170</h1>

<p>I much preferred when you were pleading with me to drop everything and hurry to your side. What was it you said? “None save thee can satisfy this need─”</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00180</h1>

<p>Go on...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00190</h1>

<p>Th-Thine artless attempts to misrepresent mine all-too-innocent motives do thee little credit!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00200</h1>

<p>Mine intent, as well thou knowest, was but to impress upon thee the gravity of the circumstance. Lest thou doubt, a deiform entity shall shortly be summoned, save if thou, and no other, grantest my compeers thine aid.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00210</h1>

<p>You still haven't found it, then? Your missing aetheryte?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00220</h1>

<p>We have not, no.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00230</h1>

<p>We know that Iceheart teleported to an aetheryte not far from the first, yet even after careful analysis, we could not locate the second beacon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00240</h1>

<p>We now suspect that the heretics destroyed the second aetheryte to impede our pursuit.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00250</h1>

<p>Our allies continue to scour Snowcloak for Iceheart's sanctuary, but we have no guarantee that they will find it. Yet it must be found, for even now Iceheart prepares to call upon Saint Shiva.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00260</h1>

<p>I'm sorry but...if the aetheryte's been destroyed, then that's that.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00270</h1>

<p>Although... You're absolutely sure she used the first aetheryte, are you? She didn't just use teleportation magicks?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00280</h1>

<p>One of our own bore witness to her escape. I can say with absolute certainty that Iceheart used the aetheryte.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00290</h1>

<p>In that case, there might be a way─so long as the aetherial current is still flowing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00300</h1>

<p>Truly? How?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00310</h1>

<p>We use the current to recreate the beacon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00320</h1>

<p>As you know, aetherytes are a bit like lighthouses. We use them to reconstitute our physical forms when crossing the aetherial sea. Without them, we'd lose all sense of direction and our essence would dissipate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00350</h1>

<p>However, we don't rely solely on these beacons. There are currents of aether which flow between them─currents which help guide us to our destination.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00360</h1>

<p>Now, these currents will gradually dwindle away to nothing if an aetheryte is destroyed. But if even a sluggish flow remains, we could theoretically use it to direct a surge of concentrated aether towards the void left by the beacon and thereby fill it up again.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00380</h1>

<p>Like opening the floodgates to fill a dry riverbed. Though, correct me if I'm wrong, but would we not need a veritable reservoir of aether?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00390</h1>

<p>In concert, we might manage to channel a sufficient volume, yet that is not my chief concern.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00400</h1>

<p>To direct the flow of so great a volume of aether with the requisite precision would be a nigh-impossible task in itself.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00410</h1>

<p>I barely succeeded in facilitating travel to an unattuned beacon. That which you describe sounds considerably more difficult.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00420</h1>

<p>And dangerous! Every person who has attempted to teleport in this fashion has died in the process. They, however, did not have white auracite at their disposal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00440</h1>

<p>I can use it to channel all the aether you can give me into the aetheryte. However, white auracite cannot retain aether for an extended period of time, so we would need to infuse it immediately beforehand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00450</h1>

<p>Just so you know, I'd confidently give this plan better than even odds of success. And if the worst comes to the worst, your people won't suffer.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00490</h1>

<p>Though it risk the lives of our best and brightest, we have not the time to seek other options.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00500</h1>

<p>If the aetherial current still flows, we shall carry out Moenbryda's plan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00510</h1>

<p>That's the spirit! Let's roll the dice!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00010</h1>

<p>You should never have come here, Warrior of Light. I labor only to forge a lasting peace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00020</h1>

<p>A peace you would deny us out of ignorance and blind faith.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00030</h1>

<p>No matter. If it is our fate to be at odds, then it is mine to strike you down.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00040</h1>

<p>We whom gods and men have forsaken shall be the instruments of our own deliverance!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00050</h1>

<p>Partake of my flesh─fill this vessel with your light! Walk amongst your brothers and sisters once more!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00060</h1>

<p>O Saint Shiva, still the hatred within our hearts and bless us with eternal grace!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00070</h1>

<p>Hmph...</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00010</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Fool... Blind, bloody fool.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00020</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)You of all people should understand the suffering war begets─that no sacrifice is too great if it brings an end to the violence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00021</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Mine is the righteous cause!</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00030</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)You fight in a war you do not understand─a pawn of liars and schemers.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00040</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)And they are no less ignorant than you! Following the creed of their fathers without question, never thinking to ask why.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00050</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Trapped in a delusion of their own creation and blind to the truth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00060</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Warrior of Light, redemption is not beyond us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00070</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)We who walk before may lead those who walk after.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00080</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Seek the Keeper of the Lake. See with eyes unclouded.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00090</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Do...do not squander Mother's gift.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00100</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Hear... Feel... Think...</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00110</h1>

<p>(-???-)And so the vessel withdraws. A predictable outcome.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00120</h1>

<p>(-???-)Nevertheless, Lahabrea will be pleased.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00130</h1>

<p>(-???-)How unfortunate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00010</h1>

<p>On behalf of the Holy See of Ishgard, allow me to express my deepest thanks.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00020</h1>

<p>Never before have we been required to contend with a primal. Indeed, there were fears in some quarters that our knights might not be equal to the task.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00030</h1>

<p>From what we have now learned of these beings, I can say with certainty that we would have lost a great many men had the Scions not intervened.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00040</h1>

<p>Then the argument for preemptive action should be self-evident. Perchance now you will reconsider my proposal that Ishgard move against Natalan?</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00050</h1>

<p>Ere we first met, a similar proposal was tabled─but the Holy See decreed that we were to observe, and that military action should be taken only in self-defense.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00060</h1>

<p>All things considered, it was not an unreasonable decision. Since the Calamity, two vigils have fallen to the Horde, while Garuda has never shown any inclination to storm the Gates of Judgement.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00070</h1>

<p>...Which is why this unprecedented crisis and its resolution may prompt a change in policy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00080</h1>

<p>You who have faced these primals know well the threat they pose. Ishgard did not─not until now.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00090</h1>

<p>And there is naught like a brush with death to change a man's outlook.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00110</h1>

<p>At the very least, this should silence any lingering objections to our arrangement with Revenant's Toll.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00120</h1>

<p>The Holy See may even feel moved to grant us its formal endorsement.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00130</h1>

<p>So far as it is possible, the Scions shall be compensated for their service.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00140</h1>

<p>We should be grateful for any aid you can provide.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00150</h1>

<p>As a gesture of good faith, I shall withdraw my previous request. Your people are doubtless needed elsewhere.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00160</h1>

<p>That will not be necessary.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00170</h1>

<p>We too have a vested interest in watching Dravania's movements.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00171</h1>

<p>I see. Once more, I must thank you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00172</h1>

<p>Ser Aymeric, if I may... Do you truly believe that Midgardsormr could return?</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00180</h1>

<p>The heavens are a window unto truth, but those who interpret their movements are not infallible. I requested your involvement as a precautionary measure.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00190</h1>

<p>But of course... You sought an excuse to compensate us from the first, mindful of what would happen if Revenant's Toll were taken by your enemies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00200</h1>

<p>Ishgard is not wont to aid its neighbors, but that does not preclude it from manipulating them to serve its own interests.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00210</h1>

<p>(-Taciturn Temple Knight-)Choose your next words carefully.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00220</h1>

<p>Do you know what sort of man becomes lord commander of the Temple Knights?</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00230</h1>

<p>One who comes from good stock. I did not, yet here I am. Now why do you suppose that is?</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00240</h1>

<p>Because I swiftly learned to tell the difference between words, deeds, and beliefs.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00250</h1>

<p>...You are correct, Master Leveilleur. Ishgard desires to see Revenant's Toll flourish, as it would present a troublesome obstacle to our enemies from the south.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00260</h1>

<p>We are so glad to be of use to you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00270</h1>

<p>As we are to you. Ours is a mutually beneficial arrangement, lest we forget. One born of necessity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00280</h1>

<p>The dragons grow more restless by the day, and the heretics harry us nigh without cease.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00290</h1>

<p>We have contended with such troubles for centuries, but there are limits to even our endurance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00300</h1>

<p>Yet as a pauper is loath to part with his meager possessions, the leaders of Ishgard are not wont to render up their trust to outsiders.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00310</h1>

<p>But with perseverance on our part, they may yet be made to see the light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00320</h1>

<p>Nevertheless, one must take care when walking the road less traveled.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00330</h1>

<p>Wise words, Ser Aymeric. I shall make a point to remember them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00340</h1>

<p>I must apologize for my earlier outburst. I hope it will not sour our good relations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00350</h1>

<p>Not at all. You but spoke from the heart.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00360</h1>

<p>I trust you understand that, at times, my duties may prevent me from meeting with you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00370</h1>

<p>On such occasions, my second-in-command will speak for me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00380</h1>

<p>(-Lucia-)Lucia, at your service.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00390</h1>

<p>(-Lucia-)Pray excuse our reticence. We are but wary of speaking too freely, lest our sentiments be made known to our enemies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00400</h1>

<p>(-Lucia-)Know that the lord commander and I are of one mind. For the sake of Ishgard─and of Eorzea at large─I pray our peoples can put aside their differences.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00410</h1>

<p>(-Lucia-)Those who dwell in the past risk losing sight of their future.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00420</h1>

<p>Should aught befall one of our shipments, pray inform Lucia immediately. You may also relay to her any words you might have for me alone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00430</h1>

<p>Not being of Ishgardian birth, she owes no allegiance to any noble house, making her as near to incorruptible as one can find in my homeland. Suffice it to say, I trust her completely, and so may you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00440</h1>

<p>Which reminds me─ Lord Haurchefant, if you would be so kind.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00450</h1>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00460</h1>

<p>In times such as these, trust is ever in short supply. Mayhap this will go some way to rectify the problem.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00470</h1>

<p>The results of our investigation into the heretics' recent attacks, as well as our interrogation of the merchant you detained.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00480</h1>

<p>Ser Aymeric... I cannot thank you enough.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00490</h1>

<p>Think nothing of it. Ishgard may be many things, but it is no friend to Garlemald.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00500</h1>

<p>Did I not tell you to have faith, my friend?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00010</h1>

<p>Words cannot well express how glad I am to see you returned to us hale and whole.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00011</h1>

<p>Needless to say, I am most eager to hear your account of that which occurred in Coerthas─assuming you are ready to speak of it?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00020</h1>

<p>Excellent. I shall summon the others at once.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00030</h1>

<p>Iceheart used her own body as a vessel for a primal's soul?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00040</h1>

<p>Master Louisoix's writings make no mention of such a possibility. Can we be certain this entity was a primal?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00050</h1>

<p>As certain as we can be that Good King Moggle Mog XII was a primal, I should think. Both were ostensibly summoned.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00060</h1>

<p>Let's not quibble over definitions. Of more concern is the implication that Iceheart retained her will even after she was possessed. We are talking about a mortal wielding the power of a primal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00070</h1>

<p>It can't possibly be that easy, can it? There must be some sort of sacrifice required. Or maybe she's just special?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00080</h1>

<p>What qualities this woman possesseth, I know not, but full sure am I that she was groomed for this role.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00090</h1>

<p>Few are privy to the secrets of summoning, and but a single party standeth to profit from their dissemination.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00100</h1>

<p>Well, I wouldn't presume to comment on how the lass came to know about summoning, but I will say that what she summoned was a primal. The readings were the same, or near as damn it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00110</h1>

<p>Strange as it all sounds, it's really no different from what you've faced before.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00120</h1>

<p>Then mayhap it is time that we reexamined our previous encounters.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00130</h1>

<p>Pack your things, Yda. We're going back to Gridania.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00140</h1>

<p>Yes sir!</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00150</h1>

<p>About Iceheart's final words to you...</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00200</h1>

<p>"Hear... Feel... Think...“</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00210</h1>

<p>Hydaelyn speaks to her as well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00211</h1>

<p>If Iceheart is blessed with the power of the Echo, she will doubtless have used it to further her goals.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00212</h1>

<p>...Or could it be that it was a revelation granted her by the Echo which first set her on this path? She did say that the Ishgardians were blind to the truth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00213</h1>

<p>Do you think she has knowledge of the origins of the Ishgardian-Dravanian war? It would do much to explain her unwavering conviction.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00220</h1>

<p>Did not the Lady Iceheart implore thee to seek the Keeper of the Lake? And did she not imply that in so doing thou wouldst come to see with eyes unclouded?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00230</h1>

<p>Midgardsormr was a king amongst kings who reigned for centuries on end... But he is dead, and his wisdom lost to the ages─unless the Ishgardians' fears are well founded...</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00240</h1>

<p>It would seem we have yet another reason to stand watch over the Keeper of the Lake. For a mercy, we are well positioned to do so.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00280</h1>

<p>Iceheart, Shiva, Ascians, and Midgardsormr. I shudder to think how they are all connected...</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00010</h1>

<p>I have heard. Truly bothersome business.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00020</h1>

<p>No, I do not foresee a problem on that front. The main concern is Raubahn─there is no telling what the brute might do.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00030</h1>

<p>Have the Blades watch him and the Flames day and night.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00040</h1>

<p>You may leave the sultana to me. I shall personally attend Her Grace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00050</h1>

<p><sigh></p>

<br/>
<h1>H00060</h1>

<p>Sever one of the East Aldenard trade routes. That ought to keep Lolorito occupied for a while.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00070</h1>

<p>Nanamo Ul Namo... For my sake, pray be a good little sultana to the last.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00010</h1>

<p>Welcome back, my friend. I have already received word from Alphinaud.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00011</h1>

<p>To think that Flame Marshal Roaille was the Garlean agent... I know not what to say.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00020</h1>

<p>Together with Raubahn, Eline lent us much-needed aid at the time of our order's founding. She was particularly passionate about the need to tackle the primal threat.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00030</h1>

<p>When we discussed the subject, her eyes fairly shone with determination. Whatever else she may have been, I choose to believe that it was her true self with whom I spoke then...</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00040</h1>

<p>But now is not the time to dwell on such matters.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00050</h1>

<p>I have an important announcement to make regarding our effort to defeat the Ascians. We shall begin as soon as everyone is assembled.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00060</h1>

<p>My thanks for coming, friends. Moenbryda, the floor is yours.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00070</h1>

<p>By now, I'm sure you're all familiar with white auracite, the miraculous material that'll allow us to capture Ascian souls.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00080</h1>

<p>Back at Snowcloak, we verified its ability to absorb vast amounts of aether.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00090</h1>

<p>Alas, it leaves something to be desired in the area of stability. The stone can only store aether for a short while before expelling its contents.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00100</h1>

<p>In addition to auracite's inherent limitations, we must needs be wary of our enemy's strength.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00110</h1>

<p>Our foe draweth upon an infinite wellspring of power. Even should we succeed in entrapping him, the stone will not long contain his wrath.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00120</h1>

<p>Meaning that if we want to kill the swine, we'll have to be quick about it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00130</h1>

<p>'Tis our belief that an Ascian soul may be permanently undone if smitten by a sufficiently concentrated burst of pure aether.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00140</h1>

<p>The only trouble is, we can't say for sure how concentrated the burst needs to be... Without knowing how much aether an Ascian soul is composed of, we're basically guessing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00150</h1>

<p>Our sole clue lieth in thy struggle with Lahabrea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00160</h1>

<p>During that encounter, Hydaelyn bid you forge what She called “a blade of Light,” a weapon which took the form of a luminous stream of energy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00170</h1>

<p>Based on your description, we believe the “blade” with which you vanquished your foe was composed of aether.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00180</h1>

<p>Admittedly, your victory proved ephemeral, as Lahabrea was able to use a Crystal of Darkness to flee into the space that lies between our world and the void.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00190</h1>

<p>The fact remains, however, that Hydaelyn placed the means to destroy the Ascians in your hands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00200</h1>

<p>Be that as it may, it would be unwise to assume that She will do the same when next we encounter such a foe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00210</h1>

<p>Quite so, my lady. We must needs find the means to forge our own blade of aether─one to equal that which Hydaelyn did benevolently bestow upon Her champion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00220</h1>

<p>That is all well and good, but it seems to me that producing such a blade will require a prodigious quantity of aether. Whence will it come, pray tell?</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00230</h1>

<p>Ummm... Oh! What if we had two pieces of white auracite? One to trap the Ascian, and the other to store the aether for the blade!</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00240</h1>

<p>Nice try, but it's as I said: the stone won't hold aether for any length of time. We'd still need to collect the stuff there and then, sorry to say.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00250</h1>

<p>And therein lies the rub: finding a way to create the blade whenever and wherever we choose.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00260</h1>

<p>'Twould seem more research is in order.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00270</h1>

<p>I'm going to linger awhile─perform a few more tests on the auracite.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00280</h1>

<p>And I could do with some help. Urianger, why don't you lend me a hand?</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00290</h1>

<p>M-Mine apologies, but I am required at the Waking Sands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00300</h1>

<p>Lady Minfilia hath given me sole charge of the premises. 'Twould be unseemly to leave them unattended.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00310</h1>

<p>"Sole charge,“ you say? So...you're basically alone there, then? Well, that settles it! I'll just have to come to you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00320</h1>

<p>While you were afield, word arrived from the Sharlayan motherland.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00330</h1>

<p>You will recall that a survey party was dispatched to investigate the incident at the Isle of Val. What they discovered was troubling to say the least.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00340</h1>

<p>According to the report, the isle has been erased from existence. 'Twas as if a hole had been torn in the very fabric of reality.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00350</h1>

<p>Aye...yet the mystery endeth not with the isle's disappearance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00360</h1>

<p>It hath come to light that a number of scholars in various other locales were reported missing at a similar juncture.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00370</h1>

<p>What's more, they all had something in common with the head of the Students of Baldesion. Every last one of them was researching a phenomenon called dimensional compression─or the “Rejoining,” as the ancient texts call it. I'll be damned if that's a coincidence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00380</h1>

<p>All indications suggest Ascian involvement, but I sense that a force greater still is at work─the entity the dark beings call “the one true god”...</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00390</h1>

<p>We must pray that my dear friend Krile regains consciousness soon. If she bore witness to the Isle of Val's final moments, she may be able to shed some light on this mystery...</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00010</h1>

<p>Following the Calamity, the forces of the XIVth Imperial Legion entrenched themselves in strategic locations across Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00020</h1>

<p>So swiftly did they accomplish this, it was suspected that they had received help. To think that it came from Roaille... My right hand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00030</h1>

<p>There is more. We have reason to believe that Roaille didn't deal exclusively with the XIVth. She also answered to a higher authority in Garlemald.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00040</h1>

<p>But this higher authority could not have been the Emperor. By consenting to the Meteor project, Solus zos Galvus showed himself to be more concerned about preventing the spread of primal influence than claiming Eorzea for the Empire. He would happily have seen the lot reduced to ash.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00050</h1>

<p>We believe a number of high-ranking figures within the royal household were against the decision, but that they knew better than to oppose the Emperor openly. Of course, this didn't prevent them from making clandestine provisions, in which Roaille played a part.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00060</h1>

<p>Alas, these provisions did not prevent Dalamud from falling, and the ensuing chaos changed the face of the realm forever. Yet Eorzea survived.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00070</h1>

<p>To all intents and purposes, the Meteor project had failed, and the Empire was left to rue its lack of a decisive means to eliminate the primals. Until, that is, it stumbled upon the Ultima Weapon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00080</h1>

<p>Even before the accursed thing was dug up, it seemed to me the XIVth had the might to overwhelm our weakened armies. Yet they chose to hide behind their walls. Why?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00090</h1>

<p>The Black Wolf was wary of making the denizens of Eorzea desperate, lest more primals emerge to bleed the land. The discovery of the Ultima Weapon, however, emboldened him to resume his war of conquest in earnest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00100</h1>

<p>But there was one in Garlemald who believed that van Baelsar's actions were premature─one who stood higher in the imperial army's chain of command. He ordered the legatus to halt his advance, only to find that the Black Wolf had slipped its leash, and that the XIVth now acted alone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00110</h1>

<p>In a bid to bring van Baelsar to heel, he used the agent he had planted in Ul'dah prior to the Calamity to undermine the legion's efforts.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00120</h1>

<p>A man who outranks van Baelsar, yet opposed the late emperor's decision to annihilate Eorzea... This could only be the former high legatus of the Garlean Army, now known as Emperor Varis zos Galvus.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00130</h1>

<p>So he was Roaille's true master...</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00140</h1>

<p>But one of several, in actual fact. We've learned that even as Roaille served the Empire's interests, she sold imperial secrets to a certain faction in Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00150</h1>

<p>In so doing, she helped to maintain the status quo, thus prolonging the conflict. Considering who stands to profit from war, it isn't hard to imagine who her other masters were.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00160</h1>

<p>Seven hells... You mean to say that she was a double agent?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00170</h1>

<p>Triple, if you consider her services to van Baelsar and the new emperor as separate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00180</h1>

<p>As neatly as these pieces seem to fit, one aspect of the puzzle remains unclear to me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00190</h1>

<p>By whose will was the marshal feeding intelligence to the heretics? And try as I might, I fail to see how aiding their cause would profit either her imperial or Monetarist masters.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00200</h1>

<p>Could it be that another hand is at work here? If so, Roaille must be made to reveal whose it is.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00210</h1>

<p>Not only have I lost a trusted friend; now I must interrogate her as a stranger.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00220</h1>

<p>Not a pleasant task, I grant you, but a necessary one. Unless we weed out the Ivy, root, stalk, and stem, it will simply grow back.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00230</h1>

<p>I know that full well. Those closest to Roaille have already been detained, and I will question them alongside her.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00240</h1>

<p>General. Pray keep in mind that there may be unwitting abettors among them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00250</h1>

<p>All will be treated fairly─on that you have my word. Those who are innocent have no cause to fear.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00260</h1>

<p>You have ever been a friend of truth, General. I hope the unpleasant task of weeding out falsehood will not detain you too long. Though it be for the sake of Eorzea, doubting one's comrades is poison to the soul.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00270</h1>

<p>...And with that, I take my leave.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00280</h1>

<p>All these years, I've been made to dance to their tune...</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00290</h1>

<p>How could you, Roaille? How could you side with them...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00300</h1>

<p>...Those cankers who take from this land and give naught in return─who use their power to disempower, and grow fat while the people starve!</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00310</h1>

<p>I know you can hear me, Monetarist scum! Your crimes will not go unpunished!</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00320</h1>

<p>One day, I will purge this land of your sickness! Before the eyes of the Twelve, I swear it!</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00330</h1>

<p>Raaaaaargh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00010</h1>

<p>I shall have no further need of you this day.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00020</h1>

<p>(-Lady-In-Waiting-)Your Grace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00030</h1>

<p>I fear that not even mine own chambers shall remain private for long.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00040</h1>

<p>Has the situation grown so grim?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00050</h1>

<p>Ever since he proposed the Carteneau Reclamation Bill, Teledji Adeledji has risen to greater prominence upon the backs of impoverished refugees.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00060</h1>

<p>The Monetarists were ever united in their pursuit of profit, but the man's actions have torn a rift in their ranks. They snap at each other as rabid dogs.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00070</h1>

<p>Yet now is not the time to be bickering among ourselves.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00080</h1>

<p>If this bickering is a threat to law and order, might you not have grounds to dissolve the Syndicate?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00090</h1>

<p>Would that the solution were so simple, Admiral. Alas, my moving to dissolve the Syndicate is certain to spark outrage among the influential merchant class, whom the cabal represents.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00100</h1>

<p>This would serve to exacerbate the current unrest, and peace would slip still further away.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00110</h1>

<p>Be they rich or poor, natives or refugees, all who reside in Ul'dah have a right to pursue happiness. It is the duty of a ruler to protect this right.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00120</h1>

<p>If I am to perform my duty, I must needs tread warily. It would not do to make enemies heedlessly.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00130</h1>

<p>Were Lord Lolorito here, he would doubtless say that I have my head in the clouds.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00140</h1>

<p>A ruler is required to take a wide view. Try as we might to cater to all needs, some will inevitably be overlooked. As such, there shall ever be citizens who feel aggrieved. It cannot be helped.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00150</h1>

<p>But as you have informed us, the Monetarists take no view but their own. They hunger for power while the masses starve.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00160</h1>

<p>In the absence of a common cause, it seems beyond any one individual to make Ul'dah whole.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00170</h1>

<p>And the presence of a Garlean agent within the Immortal Flames only makes matters worse.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00180</h1>

<p>Even accounting for Ul'dah's historic reliance upon mercenaries, such a grievous breach of security is unprecedented. I fear this business will provide the Monetarists with a rod to beat Raubahn.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00190</h1>

<p>Eorzea can ill afford for the Immortal Flames to be dampened now. Ere long, the Garleans will turn their ravenous gaze toward our lands once more. If we are to resist their might, our nations must stand together.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00200</h1>

<p>Yet for this to happen, our nations must be whole. Can naught be done to improve the situation in Ul'dah?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00210</h1>

<p>The true wealth of Ul'dah lies in the health, happiness, and hopes of her citizens. Alas, the citizens shall never know these things so long as their lives are ruled by the ambitions of the few.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00220</h1>

<p>The Monetarists claim to represent the best interests of the people, but in sooth they desire only to manipulate them for their own selfish ends.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00230</h1>

<p>For the government to serve the people, it must be formed of the people.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00240</h1>

<p>For Ul'dah to move forward, it is not only the Syndicate that must be dissolved.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00250</h1>

<p>Nay... You jest...</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00260</h1>

<p>My friends─it was for no other reason than to make known to you mine intent that I requested your presence here.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00270</h1>

<p>When I make my declaration to the people, chaos shall inevitably ensue.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00280</h1>

<p>As the last monarch in the line of Ul, I make unto you this request.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00290</h1>

<p>Help Raubahn to preserve order, and protect the people. Forsake them, and you forsake yourselves, for a strong Eorzea will ever have need of a strong Ul'dah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00300</h1>

<p>Your Grace... Are you certain of this?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00310</h1>

<p>There is no other way.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00320</h1>

<p>When the time is ripe, the nation shall become a true republic. Both Royalists and Monetarists shall cease to be.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00330</h1>

<p>Ul'dah will no longer belong to kings or queens or merchant princes, but to her people.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00340</h1>

<p>Raubahn... Forgive me for casting aside all that you have toiled for in my name...</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00350</h1>

<p>Beyond this gesture, I am powerless to help my subjects.</p>

[CUTSCENE]

2.4 A Realm Reborn Cutscenes [VoiceMan_02401]

<h1>300020</h1>

<p>His size is staggering... I can scarce imagine how Grandfather stood against such a monstrosity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>This cannot be allowed to proceed any further. Let us disable the coil and move on.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>Grandfather!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>No, that man is dead. I will not dishonor my beloved grandsire's memory by calling you such.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>You are but his twisted shade─the thrall of a mad primal.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>You were foolish to disregard my warning, child. Are you so convinced of your own righteousness?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>'Tis the rightness of our path that led us to return. Eorzea will never be safe whilst Bahamut remains to threaten all we hold dear.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>What of the hero who gave his life in defense of the realm? Do you truly dispute the justice of our cause?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>My poor, ignorant grandchildren─your world is shaped by naught but recent conflict. Listen, and I will speak to you of “justice.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>300120</h1>

<p>'Twas in the twilight of the Third Astral Era... The southern land of Meracydia suffered invasion at the hands of the Allagan Empire. With no atrocity too depraved for their purpose, the forces of Allag were unstoppable in their advance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300130</h1>

<p>Desperate for salvation, the dragons prayed to one of the first brood─to their ancestor Bahamut. Infused by the power of their fervent supplications, Bahamut arose from the abyss of death and took wing as the Meracydians' newborn god.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300140</h1>

<p>Yet this great miracle would only serve to further the maniacal designs of the dragons' imperial conquerors. The cruel fetters which bind my lord stand testament to the Allagans' boundless greed and hubris.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300150</h1>

<p>I once summoned the Twelve in an attempt to forestall the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300160</h1>

<p>What then did the dragons of Meracydia do that I did not? Wherefore are they accursed and I exalted?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300170</h1>

<p>'Tis man's overweening belief in his own primacy that blinds him to the commonness of his condition...and the truth of his own tyranny.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300180</h1>

<p>As long as man is suffered to remain, the dragons shall never be at peace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300190</h1>

<p>Only when the plague of people has been expunged shall the children of Lord Bahamut be free. Then shall the world know true justice.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300200</h1>

<p>Stop it! Grandfather would never say such things! His belief that people were worth saving never faltered!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300210</h1>

<p>He had faith in their strength...that they could stand together and push back against the darkness seeking to shape them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300220</h1>

<p>A false hope. 'Tis folly to place one's faith in so flawed a race.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300230</h1>

<p>"Stand together“? Hmph. They would first need to agree on which direction to face. If history teaches us anything, it is that man cannot find common ground between his own two feet.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300240</h1>

<p>Even you, twins whose veins run with the same blood, struggle to fathom each other's reasoning. You hide your differing agendas behind the convenient banner of Eorzea's salvation. Given your obvious self-interest, can you truly claim no kinship with the Allagans?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300250</h1>

<p>And though I hoped they might bring you closer, 'twould seem that the twin grimoires I bestowed upon you were a wasted gesture...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300260</h1>

<p>There may well be truth in your judgment of Alisaie and me... But such a one-sided tirade bemoaning the evils of man rings false coming from the lips of Archon Louisoix.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300270</h1>

<p>Tell me─do you champion the cause of dragons because Bahamut compels you as his thrall?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300280</h1>

<p>Or is it because you yourself have transcended the limits of man's existence?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300290</h1>

<p>Ah, so the possibility did not escape your notice? What I prayed for, and what I have become...these are the keys that unlock the truth behind Eorzea's rebirth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300300</h1>

<p>If you would have them, then you must needs take them by force. Come, rend this divine form asunder and claim your answers!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300310</h1>

<p>But...I thought... He has become a primal!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300320</h1>

<p>'Tis difficult I know, but you must accept it: that entity is no phantom or impostor─it is our beloved grandsire!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300330</h1>

<p>Please─for his sake and for ours─you must defeat our grandfather!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>Grandfather is truly gone this time. But better it end this way than the alternative...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>I am yet here, Alisaie. My dear, sweet granddaughter...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>Grandfather...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>I must thank you, Warrior of Light. Without your valor, I might never have broken free of Bahamut's control.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>These last few moments are mine to live as the man I once was.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>This is all that I wanted. Yet now that it is happening, I find myself struggling to believe it... Is it really you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400070</h1>

<p>Grandfather, pray forgive me my insolence. It was not my intent to demean you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400080</h1>

<p>Forgive you? I am proud of you, child. You were wise enough to deduce the manner of creature I had become.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400090</h1>

<p>Alphinaud. Alisaie. If any here should beg forgiveness, it is I.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400100</h1>

<p>Grandfather, I must ask... Will you not tell us what befell during the Calamity?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400110</h1>

<p>Yes. Yes, of course. You have come far to hear the truth...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400120</h1>

<p>Let us then begin the tale at the Battle of Carteneau, where clashed the forces of the Garlean Empire and the Eorzean Alliance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400130</h1>

<p>'Twas there in the sky above the surging armies that the elder primal Bahamut broke free of the red moon, Dalamud.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400140</h1>

<p>In an effort to contain this avatar of destruction, I called upon the Twelve to aid me in the creation of a prison of aether...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400150</h1>

<p>But Bahamut would not be caged by such feeble bars─too vast was his might; too fierce his rage.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400170</h1>

<p>You know of what happened next. I used the last of my strength to send you and your companions outside of time, and then prepared to meet my end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400180</h1>

<p>Little choice remained to me. I used the last of my strength to entrust our hope unto the future, and prepared to meet my end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>As you have no doubt surmised, I did not perish. When the cage built from the essences of the Twelve was destroyed, the sky was filled with a colossal cloud of aether...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500020</h1>

<p>This drifting energy responded to the prayers of those fighting below─and to my own desperate wish that the dying realm be saved─by infusing me with the power of a primal.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500030</h1>

<p>I became the immortal Phoenix, ancient symbol of rebirth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500040</h1>

<p>Rising into the sky, I struck Bahamut with all my newfound strength. The blow shattered his earthly form, and a shower of aether rained down upon the land.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500050</h1>

<p>Thus began the rejuvenation of Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500060</h1>

<p>Believing the deed done, I relinquished my hold on that staggering energy, desirous that it should be returned to the realm without delay.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500070</h1>

<p>But I had not reckoned on Bahamut's tenacious will. Even as he teetered upon the cusp of oblivion, the dragon reached out to claim me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500080</h1>

<p>Alas, within my fast fading form, enough remained of the Phoenix's energy to offer Bahamut a hold, and he dragged me along in his wake.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500090</h1>

<p>And thus began your existence as the elder primal's thrall...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500100</h1>

<p>I cannot help but wonder at his will to survive... Though he was all but obliterated, Bahamut found a way to seize the power you surrendered.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500110</h1>

<p>That would explain why part of his physical form survived to be entombed underground.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500120</h1>

<p>'Twould also explain why Eorzea was so terribly warped. Even as the land sought to restore itself, the returning flow of aether was cut off.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500130</h1>

<p>Very good. When his grip on existence was once again secured, Bahamut did not cease his feast until he had consumed every last mote of aether that yet floated in the air.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500140</h1>

<p>And still he was not fully restored...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500150</h1>

<p>You must remember that by this time, much of the freed aether had already returned to the land. That which remained was not sufficient to reconstruct so massive a form in its entirety.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500160</h1>

<p>But there did not need to be─not for a being sustained by the marvels of Allagan technology.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500170</h1>

<p>As long as some piece of Bahamut persists, the coils will seek it out and continue their regenerative task.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500180</h1>

<p>The fragments of Dalamud appear motionless from the surface, but deep beneath the ground they had been searching...tunneling through rock and soil towards their escaped prisoner.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500190</h1>

<p>And, as you have observed for yourselves, they found his heart.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500200</h1>

<p>Warrior of Light, heed me. You must put a stop to Bahamut's regeneration.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500210</h1>

<p>Whether it be for man or for dragonkind, the question of justice is irrelevant. The elder primal will leave naught but a smoldering wasteland for both his children and ours.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500220</h1>

<p>I beg you to defend Eorzea─as you always have, and as I always knew you would.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500230</h1>

<p>I beg you to defend Eorzea, and guide its people to the future they yet struggle to find.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500240</h1>

<p>This portal will take you to the final internment hulk. 'Tis time for the tale of Bahamut and his part in the Calamity to come to an end!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500250</h1>

<p>Alphinaud, Alisaie. Pray come closer.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500260</h1>

<p>Your hopes and dreams must no longer be an extension of mine. You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm─your own meaning in this sea of chaos.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500270</h1>

<p>Will you do that for me?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500280</h1>

<p>Of course, Grandfather. I have already made it my mission to see this newborn Eorzea survive and flourish.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500290</h1>

<p>Alisaie. While I was yet in thrall to Bahamut, you spoke of my faith in man's strength. Know that your words reached me, imprisoned though my soul still was.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500300</h1>

<p>So forceful was your conviction, I wonder if that belief has not become your own. Perhaps, after all your anger and sorrow was spent, you found something greater within you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500310</h1>

<p>See this fight to its culmination. 'Tis also your strength in which I have faith.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500320</h1>

<p>Thank you...for everything... Pray take your rest, Grandfather... You deserve it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500330</h1>

<p>There are records of an art that allowed one to summon the power of a primal from the essence of its demise.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500340</h1>

<p>And though I am no true primal, all that I have left, I give to you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500350</h1>

<p>Alphinaud. Alisaie. My darling grandchildren. May Light's blessings ever keep and protect you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500360</h1>

<p>Come, Warrior of Light. Our task remains undone!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>'Twas a long and arduous road, but at last we reach its end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>Farewell, Bahamut. I banish you back to the aether!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>He is not yet whole! I did not think him capable...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600040</h1>

<p>Ah!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600050</h1>

<p>Ugh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600060</h1>

<p>Ugh... Alisaie! ALISAIE!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600070</h1>

<p>I had thought it finally over...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600080</h1>

<p>We'll not survive another blast!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600090</h1>

<p>No... Is this how I honor my promise to Grandfather?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600100</h1>

<p>You must needs find your own reason to fight for this realm─your own meaning in this sea of chaos. Will you do that for me?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600110</h1>

<p>I will, Grandfather. In fact, I believe I already have.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600120</h1>

<p>That reason has been with me all along, guiding me─Eorzea's blade of Light, shearing through the endless shrouds of darkness...</p>

<h1>600130</h1>

<p>I have been shown the miraculous feats of which we are all capable. Of which I am capable.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600140</h1>

<p>Bahamut! You have wreaked enough havoc!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600150</h1>

<p>I will not let your wrathful fires consume all that we know and love!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600160</h1>

<p>Ugh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600170</h1>

<p>How long I have waited to hear you say that! You have found your resolve at last!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600180</h1>

<p>Let me join my strength to yours.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600190</h1>

<p>In this place, in this moment, our purpose has become one!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600191</h1>

<p>(-Alphinaud and Alisaie-)For the future of Eorzea!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600200</h1>

<p>This last task is yours, Warrior of Light! You must destroy Bahamut's crystal core!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>You did it!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>But one task remains...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>With this last coil disabled, there shall be naught left to bind Bahamut to this world. His beloved children will finally know peace...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700040</h1>

<p>'Tis done. He is truly gone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700050</h1>

<p>You knew, didn't you? You knew what Grandfather had become.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700060</h1>

<p>I...was not certain. But from all I had gleaned, it seemed a distinct possibility.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700070</h1>

<p>The scene people describe of the Battle of Carteneau was one of unimaginable devastation. And 'tis through the combined prayers of the desperate─and an abundant source of aether─that primals are born. I merely put two and two together.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700080</h1>

<p>And you consider that a sufficient explanation?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700090</h1>

<p>Well, however you stumbled across your theory, 'twas this revelation that made you wary of my attachment to Grandfather.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700100</h1>

<p>You feared that in my obsession, I would fall under his primal sway. Is that why you decided to join us? To pull me back should I show signs of wavering?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700110</h1>

<p>Pray forgive me, Sister. I wished only to protect you. Yet I see now that I needn't have doubted the strength of your conviction.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700120</h1>

<p>May I ask you a question? What do you now intend to do with the truth you have uncovered?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700130</h1>

<p>Which particular truth was that, Brother? The fact that desperate prayer gave rise to the primal Phoenix? That this new god was responsible for setting Eorzea on the path to rebirth?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700140</h1>

<p>Should such a tale become common knowledge, people would soon offer up their prayers in earnest─they would beseech Phoenix to complete the healing that was begun.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700150</h1>

<p>Yet as you and I know all too well, the very act of calling forth this savior would do more harm to the land than good.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700160</h1>

<p>We cannot encourage such worship for this very reason. Were Grandfather forced to return as an aether-draining primal, 'twould undo all that he had worked to protect.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700170</h1>

<p>Your abiding love for him was the key that unlocked the truth of the Calamity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700180</h1>

<p>But keys may also serve to seal doors that were best left unopened.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700190</h1>

<p>Let your love now guide your actions, and lock away deep inside the fate of both Grandfather and Bahamut.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700200</h1>

<p>Fear not, Alphinaud─I understand what must be done.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700210</h1>

<p>The realm need not know the truth for it to be saved.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700220</h1>

<p>That the elder primal is banished, to return no more...that is enough.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700230</h1>

<p>Let us make our way back to the surface. Poor Urianger must be beside himself with worry!</p>

[CUTSCENE]

2.5 A Realm Reborn Cutscenes [VoiceMan_02500]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>I believe the two of you have met?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>We have. I had hoped to speak with Commander Leveilleur as well, but I cannot afford to wait any longer.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>The lord commander sent me hither to request your aid in a matter of grave import.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>You see now why I had Tataru summon you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>Now that we are all assembled, perhaps you would be good enough to elaborate on the nature of the matter which brought you to us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>The Observatorium's astrologians have sounded the alarum.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>Last night, the dragon star burned with an intensity not seen in fifteen summers.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>Not since the Dravanians engaged the Empire in the Battle of Silvertear Skies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>“The northern sky doth burn full bright upon the wyrm lord's call. The red behemoth beckoneth, and flame consumeth all.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>The old Coerthan rhyme, aye.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>The brightening of the dragon star is said to accompany the roar of a great wyrm. The astrologians believe that it was Midgardsormr himself who cried out on this occasion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>After an absence of centuries, the king of kings did return to lead his kind against the might of Garlemald...</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>...Only to fall in his duel with the Agrius, proud flagship of the Garlean fleet. Devoid of life, his corpse remaineth entwined about the magitek monstrosity even unto this day.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>Urianger has the right of it. Whatever this alteration in the dragon star portends, the great wyrm has shown no sign of life.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000160</h1>

<p>Tataru, have the Domans reported aught out of the ordinary?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000170</h1>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but if Midgardsormr had roared, wouldn't we have heard it here in Revenant's Toll?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000180</h1>

<p>“Roar” is but a figure of speech. Dravanians can communicate in ways beyond our ken.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000190</h1>

<p>It is for this very reason that we are forced to look for signs in the heavens. We cannot say with any confidence that a great wyrm roared at all, much less that it was Midgardsormr.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000200</h1>

<p>Only by directly examining the Keeper of the Lake can we be certain. However, it will take too long to gain the Holy See's approval to dispatch the Temple Knights.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000210</h1>

<p>Therefore, Ser Aymeric would entrust this task to you. Do you accept?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000220</h1>

<p>We knew you would not disappoint us. Now, if you would excuse me, I must return and assist the lord commander. We have precious little time to prepare.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000230</h1>

<p>To prepare for what, pray tell?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000240</h1>

<p>When a great wyrm roars, his brethren cannot choose but answer. We prepare for battle.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>Who treadeth now upon my bones and waketh me from slumber sweet?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>Thou hast forgotten the face of thy lord. Remember, mortal, and fear me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>By Her gifts hast thou earned a moment's reprieve.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>Speak, mortal, and I shall listen.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>Guided by a star...? Heh heh heh.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>My people have heard the song. Ishgard shall burn.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>Sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>We do not forget. We do not forgive.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>Seven children did I sire. One now singeth of retribution.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>I rise to join in the chorus.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200090</h1>

<p>Thou art powerless to silence us, mortal. Yet thou shalt not live to labor in vain. Thy reprieve is at an end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200100</h1>

<p>Hmph. Trickery is thy shield. This frail, ignoble creature is not gifted, but chosen...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200110</h1>

<p>Hearken to me, Hydaelyn! I remember...and I consent.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200120</h1>

<p>Fear not, mortal... I shall not harm thee...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200130</h1>

<p>Heh heh heh. Mayhap thou thinkest me an oathbreaker?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200140</h1>

<p>Thou art mistaken. If thou comest to harm, it shall be by another's hand, not mine.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200150</h1>

<p>I did but strip thee of thy mistress's feeble blessing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200160</h1>

<p>Thou didst profit much by Her grace, but no more.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200170</h1>

<p>The covenant binds me to thee.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200180</h1>

<p>I shall watch...listen...and wait.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200190</h1>

<p>Fight and struggle, if it be thy will.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200200</h1>

<p>Man hath ever coveted that which lieth beyond his grasp.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200210</h1>

<p>I drink of Her body, and thence doth mine own find new life.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200220</h1>

<p>When it hath grown whole, the loyal and penitent shall rejoice.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200230</h1>

<p>The Dragonsong heraldeth a beginning...and an end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>My friend! I can scarce believe it! You confronted the wyrm lord and lived to tell the tale!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>I give thanks to Halone for your preservation. It is our sole cause for gladness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>Your encounter with the Keeper of the Lake served to confirm our fears. A great wyrm has roared, and it makes little difference if it was one of the two in Eorzea or any other...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>The Dravanians are coming.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>I am told that Ishgard has magical defenses against Dravanian attack, though I am not privy to their exact nature.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>Will they be enough to repel a massive force?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>Ishgard has weathered countless assaults over centuries. This will be no different.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>And now that you have confirmed the threat, none can ignore the lord commander's calls for the wards to be strengthened.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>I dare not presume to speak for him, but I expect the lord commander would sing your praises.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>I must away, but we shall meet again soon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>Countless assaults weathered...and this will be no different? Why am I not convinced?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>Now that everything's calmed down a bit─relatively speaking, I mean─I thought it might be a good time to share our progress on the weapon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>I believe we're on the verge of a breakthrough.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>Well, don't keep us all in suspense.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>Just in case anyone's forgotten, let's start by reviewing what we already know. So! An Ascian is an immortal because its soul doesn't return to the aetherial realm when its host is defeated. Instead, it flees to the place that lies between our world and the void.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>Therefore, the first step to permanently defeating an Ascian is preventing its soul from making this journey. And if you recall, when we last gathered here, I had verified that white auracite has adequate capacity to entrap the beings, albeit only briefly.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>Which left the small matter of their extermination.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400070</h1>

<p>Aye. To unmake an Ascian soul, one must needs smite it with a concentrated burst, or “blade,” of purest aether. However, we wanted for both the data and the means to forge such a weapon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400080</h1>

<p>Short of experimenting on an actual Ascian, you see, there's no way to gauge how much aether its soul is made of.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400090</h1>

<p>As such, we don't know what aetheric density our blade needs to have in order for it to work.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400100</h1>

<p>So we'll just have to make the densest blade we can, and hope for the best! Though that would require a lot of aether...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400110</h1>

<p>Hang on a minute! Why didn't we think of this before!? White auracite can hold an absolute heap of aether, can't it!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400120</h1>

<p>Please tell me you're joking. Gods' sakes, Yda! I feel as though I'm reliving the same scene over and over with you! How many times do you need to be told that white auracite cannot store aether for long periods?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400130</h1>

<p>Being intangible matter, aether is given to dispersion; only in its crystallized form is it a stable source of energy. I will test you later on this, so see to it you do not forget.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400140</h1>

<p>Ah...r-right, yes... It's all coming back to me...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400150</h1>

<p>So our hopes rest on good old crystals again, do they? While they are certainly reliable, they leave something to be desired in the area of portability.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400160</h1>

<p>Indeed. I am reminded of the quantity of corrupted crystals required to thwart Leviathan, and the extraordinary lengths to which the Lominsans went to transport them. What if it should prove that a similar quantity was needed to destroy an Ascian soul─or still more...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400170</h1>

<p>I do not envy the poor sod who has to lug all of that around on the off chance that an Ascian appears.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400180</h1>

<p>That's the very problem we set out to solve, and I reckon we've found the answer. If it isn't practical to lug around the aether we need, we'll just have to draw upon another source.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400190</h1>

<p>And the only viable source is the land.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400200</h1>

<p>If you mean to tap the great river of aether, know that it will entail considerable risk. Meddling with the currents may well induce a surge like to the one which despoiled Mor Dhona.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400210</h1>

<p>Give me a bit more credit, will you? Why would we need to tap the river when there're veritable reservoirs jutting out all over the land?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400220</h1>

<p>Aye, I speak of corrupted crystals. It might be that their aspect is out of balance, but a crystal's a crystal─it contains aether, and we can help ourselves to it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400230</h1>

<p>While corrupted crystals are indeed abundant, there is no guarantee that they will be in close proximity at a crucial moment.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400240</h1>

<p>Ah, but what if we don't need them to be? What if we could tap their power from afar? A malm away, say?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400250</h1>

<p>If we could do that, we'd have ready access to aether aplenty in almost every corner of Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400260</h1>

<p>I've yet to put my theories to the proof, but I've got a good feeling about this. If no one has any objections, I'd like to see where this avenue leads.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400270</h1>

<p>If you think it worth your while, you have my blessing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400280</h1>

<p>But tell us, what are your theories? I for one am most eager to understand the process, however vaguely.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400290</h1>

<p>I thought you might say that. But no one wants to listen to boring old theories all day, do they? I know I don't. So, with your permission, I'd like to try something a bit more hands-on. I've already built an aetheric siphon especially for this purpose, and I've been meaning to try it out.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400300</h1>

<p>Thing is, the profusion of corrupted crystals in Mor Dhona makes it something of a high-risk testing ground. If anything goes awry with the siphon, it would be better if it didn't happen within spitting distance of quite so much aether.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400310</h1>

<p>Ideally, I need an isolated specimen. Does anyone know where I can find one?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400320</h1>

<p>May I suggest northern Thanalan? There you will find corrupted crystals of middling size, standing a reasonable distance apart. Ideal for your needs, I should have thought. Oh, and if you do elect to visit the place, I should be much obliged if you would assist me in another matter while you are in the area.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400330</h1>

<p>Has something happened?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400340</h1>

<p>Movement has been observed at Castrum Meridianum.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400350</h1>

<p>During Operation Archon, the Alliance dealt the stronghold a heavy blow. Its facilities were extensively damaged, and its garrison reduced to a fraction of its former strength.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400360</h1>

<p>Not long after our forces withdrew, however, their ranks were replenished by reinforcements from Castrum Centri. They now seek to rebuild, and to this end they have their sights set upon the Ceruleum Processing Plant.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400370</h1>

<p>Having lost the Empire's support, the XIVth Legion lacks the resources to sustain itself. To them, this is a bid for survival, and they will doubtless fight like desperate men.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400380</h1>

<p>Though I have dispatched the Crystal Braves, I fear their strength alone may not suffice to stay the imperial assault. I would request the Scions' aid in the defensive effort.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400390</h1>

<p>If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to inveigle us into fighting your battle with the promise of shiny crystals!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400400</h1>

<p>Well then, consider me inveigled! I won't lie, the crystals you speak of sound perfect─so the Garleans have to go!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400410</h1>

<p>Besides, we can't afford to beat about the bush. There's no telling when the Ascians will next appear.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400420</h1>

<p>Thine eagerness to hurl thyself into the jaws of danger cometh as little surprise. Exercise due caution, I prithee.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400430</h1>

<p>Though you have become a Crystal Brave, you are yet a Scion, Alphinaud. We could hardly refuse you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400440</h1>

<p>Pray join the Crystal Braves and lend them your support. Thancred and Papalymo shall accompany you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400450</h1>

<p>Yda and Y'shtola─in the meantime I would have you assist Moenbryda. Scout out the crystal clusters, that the testing may commence as soon as the Garlean threat has been eliminated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400460</h1>

<p>If it please you, I shall continue mine own experiments on white auracite.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400470</h1>

<p>Thank you, Urianger. Everyone, pray see to your preparations and depart as soon as you are able. Go well, and be safe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>Hold on. I won't be a second.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500020</h1>

<p>The beast seemed peckish, so I gave it a taste of my axe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500030</h1>

<p>I know, I know... As Urianger never tires of reminding me, “An axe ill becometh the hand of a scholar.” What can I say? I like axes. To hear my mother tell it, I came into this world holding one.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500040</h1>

<p>And it's not as if it stopped me picking up a quill, is it? I often think of the man who introduced me to the joys of learning... He's one of the reasons I decided to come to Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500050</h1>

<p>...Him and my excruciatingly stiff childhood friend. Considering how unalike we are, it's a wonder we ever got on. The world's a strange old place, isn't it?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500060</h1>

<p>Aye, that ought to do it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500070</h1>

<p>So far, so good. At these concentrations, it shouldn't matter too much if something goes awry. Just enough aether to make it interesting.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500080</h1>

<p>Did you see that? The way the crystal glowed?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500090</h1>

<p>The siphon works, I'm happy to say. With a few refinements, it should satisfy our appetite for aether. Which just leaves the small matter of forging our blade.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500100</h1>

<p>I'm not sure how to go about it just yet, but I swear to find a way. I'll put a blade in your hands if it's the last thing I do.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500110</h1>

<p>(-???-)She senses me. A useful talent.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500120</h1>

<p>An Ascian!? Are they onto us!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500130</h1>

<p>By your brand, I see you are an Archon of Sharlayan. Keeper of knowledge. Seeker of truth. Meddler.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500140</h1>

<p>I don't know what the hells you're saying, but I don't much like your tone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500150</h1>

<p>Hahaha. Your instincts serve you well. But come, be not unsettled on my account. That lovely brow was not made for frowns. Ah, but I waste my breath.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500160</h1>

<p>Let me direct my words to one who understands them. We meet at last, Warrior of Light. I am Nabriales...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500170</h1>

<p>...And you have long been a thorn in my side. I suffered the overweening presence of Lahabrea that men might host the power of gods, only for you to undo my hard work.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500180</h1>

<p>Yaaarrrgh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500190</h1>

<p>Oh, bugger...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500200</h1>

<p>Urgh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500210</h1>

<p>Do settle down.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500220</h1>

<p>You must concede that I acted in self-defense.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500230</h1>

<p>But what's this? I do not sense the blessing of Light...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500240</h1>

<p>Oh dear! Could it be that frail Hydaelyn has forgotten Her champion!? This I did not foresee!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500250</h1>

<p>Shorn of Light as you are, you are no longer a threat. And better yet, the seal is broken.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500260</h1>

<p>Now is the time to claim the staff!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500270</h1>

<p>With it in my grasp, I shall rise above them all and take my place at Lord Zodiark's right hand!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500280</h1>

<p>What did that bastard want with us?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500290</h1>

<p>Nabriales, he calls himself? With charm like that, I'll bet he has maidens falling at his feet. Unconscious.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500300</h1>

<p>But this staff─you say just talking about it had the bastard grinning like a brat on his nameday? Must be quite a staff.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500310</h1>

<p>Oh, gods... He means Tupsimati, Master Louisoix's staff!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500320</h1>

<p>Minfilia's in danger! We have to get back to the Rising Stones!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>You two!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>So you were able to divine my intent. What now, Warrior of Light? Ah, but that name is no longer fitting. You have become decidedly dull, and quite incapable of barring my entry.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>What do you mean!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600040</h1>

<p>You truly do not know? Then I suppose it is only right that I enlighten you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600050</h1>

<p>The blessing of Light kept you and your fellow meddlers safe. It was that which prevented my kind from entering your domain.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600060</h1>

<p>My kind, I say, though it had no power over the likes of Elidibus and Lahabrea. Being of this world, they could come and go as they please, while I could only look on...</p>

<h1>600070</h1>

<p>But I need look no longer. Now that the seal is gone, I mean to act. Unlike the others, I am not given to waiting. I shall take that staff and bring about the next Rejoining.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600080</h1>

<p>...Rejoining? Then it was your doing! The Isle of Val, the scholars─all of it!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600090</h1>

<p>You will not harm her!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600100</h1>

<p>Urrrgh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600110</h1>

<p>Moenbryda!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600120</h1>

<p>Why must you insist on forcing my hand? Did you learn nothing from our last meeting? Ah, but I forget─my words fall upon deaf ears.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600130</h1>

<p>The staff is but a broken relic─a memorial to the departed. What possible use could you have for it?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600140</h1>

<p>What use!? You mean to say that all this time, you kept the key, never knowing what it was you possessed?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600150</h1>

<p>The staff Tupsimati─or rather, the stone tablet it bears─is host to a great power.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600160</h1>

<p>Together with the horn, it can be used to draw vast quantities of aether from its bearer's surroundings.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600170</h1>

<p>How else do you think Louisoix was able to invoke the power of the Twelve without making them an offering of crystals?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600180</h1>

<p>Summoning requires not only prayer, but a profusion of aether. Even a child knows that.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600190</h1>

<p>If I did not know before, you may be certain I do now. But above all, I know that we cannot allow this staff to fall into your hands. I will die before I let you take it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600200</h1>

<p>Insufferable woman. I would happily end your miserable life here and now... Alas, Elidibus would never let me hear the end of it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600210</h1>

<p>Very well. If you will not part with the staff, I will take you too.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600220</h1>

<p>After them! Quickly...before the rift closes!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>It appears I have underestimated you... You are a formidable foe, even without the blessing of Light...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>And now I am forced to reveal this unseemly form. Hmph.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>You're safe... Thank the Twelve...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700040</h1>

<p>You may have bested me this day...but what of the next? What of all the days to come!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700050</h1>

<p>Remember: Light no longer holds sway here. I may return whensoever I wish. Again and again and again. Eventually, you will falter and the staff will be mine. Until next time, Scions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700060</h1>

<p>There will be no next time! This is the end!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700070</h1>

<p>What!? What trickery is this!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700080</h1>

<p>No! Nooo! You cannot! Nooooooooo!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700090</h1>

<p>Use Tupsimati to gather aether! Quickly, before he breaks free!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700100</h1>

<p>Concentrate! Call to mind the time you struck down Lahabrea with the blade of Light!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700110</h1>

<p>Why won't it work? Is it because we lack the blessing of Light?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700120</h1>

<p>Damn it... So much aether...and it still isn't enough...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700130</h1>

<p>Fools! No mortal prison can contain me! I shall make you pay for your insolence!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700140</h1>

<p>Please, Mother Hydaelyn! Hearken to our plea! Lend us Your divine Light!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700150</h1>

<p>Why can You not hear us? Do our words no longer reach You?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700160</h1>

<p>If only we had...a bit more aether...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700170</h1>

<p>Moenbryda! What are you doing!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700180</h1>

<p>Master Louisoix... I understand now...the choice you made...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700190</h1>

<p>In death...there is life... Farewell, Urianger...you daft old coot...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700200</h1>

<p>Moenbryda, no! You mustn't─!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700210</h1>

<p>What!? Nooo! It...it cannot end!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700220</h1>

<p>I am eternal! I am immortaaaaaal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700230</h1>

<p>Moenbryda... She's...she's gone...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700240</h1>

<p>You did it, my friend. The Ascian is dead.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800010</h1>

<p>This device is a legacy of Moenbryda's toils and sacrifice.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800020</h1>

<p>I shall hold on to it for safekeeping.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800030</h1>

<p>Minfilia! Are you all right?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800040</h1>

<p>I am.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800050</h1>

<p>We were surveying northern Thanalan when we received the distress call.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800060</h1>

<p>We returned as swiftly as we were able.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800070</h1>

<p>It seems you have everything in hand, however.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800080</h1>

<p>What happened here? Where is Moenbryda?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800090</h1>

<p>She gave her life to temper the blade of Light? I...I have no words.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800100</h1>

<p>Rather than await the inevitable, she took her fate into her own hands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800110</h1>

<p>Does...does Urianger know...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800120</h1>

<p>My friend. There is something I must tell you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800130</h1>

<p>I heard all, my lady.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800140</h1>

<p>The moon sinketh, taking her leave of the heavens. Yet her passing heraldeth the coming of a new day.<br/>
...Moenbryda hath fulfilled her destiny, hath she not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800150</h1>

<p>Long ago, far across the seas in the Sharlayan motherland, Moenbryda and I did study under the sage tutelage of Master Louisoix.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800160</h1>

<p>Full oft did he impress upon us that knowledge existeth to serve the greater good. This sentiment, however, was contrary to the nation's policy of neutrality, which censured intercedence in the affairs of foreign lands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800170</h1>

<p>In spite of vehement opposition, he founded the Circle of Knowing and journeyed hither to the heart of Eorzea. Through his noble sacrifice was the realm spared its doom.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800180</h1>

<p>Yet this great soul, whom all should rightly have honored, was branded a pariah in his own land. His peers did accuse him of forsaking his duty as a man of learning, and of meddling in the course of history.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800190</h1>

<p>When he left Sharlayan behind, Master Louisoix gave no word to signal his intent to Moenbryda. Close as they were, as master and disciple, she was deeply wounded by the sudden exclusion from his confidence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800200</h1>

<p>Above all, however, she was confused. Try as she might, she could ill comprehend her master's motive. The slanders that were heaped upon him after his passing served only to inflame the turmoil within her.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800210</h1>

<p>For years upon end, she knew not what to believe, torn as she was 'twixt the man whom she revered, and the man who forsook her and his duty both.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800220</h1>

<p>The Louisoix I knew would never forsake his duty, much less one of his own.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800230</h1>

<p>This I know full well, my lady. 'Twas not for want of love that Master Louisoix hid his intent. He but desired that Moenbryda discover her own path, free of the shadow of his influence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800240</h1>

<p>Long did I contemplate revealing the truth to her, and long did I hold my peace. After all, was it not Master Louisoix's wish that she come to the truth unaided? I told myself it was, and resolved to let her suffer.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800250</h1>

<p>Knowingly did I deny my friend the comfort she craved. And now she hath gone to her rest with doubt still in her heart.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800260</h1>

<p>Speakest thou in earnest? Did Moenbryda truly come to understand Master Louisoix's will before the end?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800270</h1>

<p>The realization hath set her free. She may now find the peace which hath for so long eluded her.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800280</h1>

<p>Oh, Moenbryda... My dearest... How I shall miss thee...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800290</h1>

<p>Moenbryda gave her life that we might possess the means to defeat the Ascians.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800300</h1>

<p>Her sacrifice must not be in vain. Let us continue her work on the blade of aether and see it to completion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800310</h1>

<p>My lady. I would mourn Moenbryda in mine own way. I beg your permission to return to the Waking Sands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800320</h1>

<p>Of course, my friend. Take all the time you require. We shall be here should you have need of us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>Forgive me, Moenbryda. Had I been quicker, or wiser...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>But I was not, and you paid the price.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>But you would not suffer us to wallow in our sorrow, would you? You would tell us to...pick ourselves up and get on with it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900040</h1>

<p>And so we shall. We shall defend this realm and her people to the last.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900060</h1>

<p>Life for death. A fair exchange.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900070</h1>

<p>Other bargains will be struck.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900050</h1>

<p>I'll never forget you, Moen. None of us will.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900080</h1>

<p>The song riseth to a crescendo.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900090</h1>

<p>Is that what I think it is...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900100</h1>

<p>Hello!? Can you hear me!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900110</h1>

<p>We have received grave tidings from Ishgard. Pray return to the Rising Stones at once.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900120</h1>

<p>Twelve forfend, is the hour already upon us!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900130</h1>

<p>Come. Our enemies do not rest, and neither will we.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00010</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)The sons must answer for their fathers' misdeeds. Only then will the cycle be broken...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00020</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Brothers and sisters of the heavens! We raise our voices and join you in the chorus!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00030</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)The sinners' feeble magicks are undone! Come! Claim your retribution!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00040</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Ahahahahahah!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00010</h1>

<p>Alphinaud, it is good to see you. Tell me, what have you learned?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00020</h1>

<p>Pray summon the others. Everyone must hear my report.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00030</h1>

<p>So this was all but a taste of what's to come...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00040</h1>

<p>Indeed. The main host advances upon Ishgard as we speak.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00050</h1>

<p>Whose vaunted defenses have been nullified.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00060</h1>

<p>Shorn of its wards, the city will bear the full force of Nidhogg's fury.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00070</h1>

<p>All those people...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00080</h1>

<p>Alphinaud is right. The Dravanians cannot be allowed to prevail. If Ishgard falls, all of Eorzea will suffer the consequences.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00090</h1>

<p>Then you agree that we have no choice but to intervene. For the good of the realm, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and the Crystal Braves must join the defense of Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00100</h1>

<p>Let there be no ambiguity about what has been proposed. We would be directly intervening in the war.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00110</h1>

<p>But if all here believe the cause to be just, then to war we shall go.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00120</h1>

<p>The path we now embark upon is perilous, but I pray you will walk with us to the end.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00130</h1>

<p>For those we have lost. For those we can yet save.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00140</h1>

<p>Then it is settled. I shall inform the council of our intentions, and request that they contribute their own forces to the defense of Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00010</h1>

<p>We are well aware of Ishgard's dilemma, and we agree with your assessment.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00020</h1>

<p>Then I trust there are no objections to the Crystal Braves' intervention?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00030</h1>

<p>Ul'dah has none.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00040</h1>

<p>Gridania does not object.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00050</h1>

<p>The Crystal Braves are yours to command, Alphinaud. Do what you will. We shall pray for your success.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00060</h1>

<p>It was my hope that you would offer more substantial aid than prayer. I know it is within your means.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00070</h1>

<p>Do not presume that you have knowledge of our every concern. The Garleans and the beast tribes are but two of many.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00080</h1>

<p>We are not in a position to contribute greatly to the defense of Ishgard─not when our own homes are still under siege.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00090</h1>

<p>We dare not leave our interests in Carteneau undefended as well. Teledji Adeledji and his ilk would seize control of the territories in our absence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00100</h1>

<p>The enemy is at their gates, and you would cower behind yours!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00110</h1>

<p>No one is cowering, boy. We will offer what support we can.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00120</h1>

<p>Aye. Support. A handful of men and no more.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00130</h1>

<p>Would that we could commit more than a token force to this cause. Yet there are others to whom you might turn. The free companies ever want for work.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00140</h1>

<p>Ah, yes, the free companies... They're not like to turn you down.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00150</h1>

<p>I beg your pardon!? You would entrust the survival of Ishgard to sellswords!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00160</h1>

<p>Crises like these are the very reason why this alliance was formed! It is our duty to aid our fellow man!</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00170</h1>

<p>My duty is to my country and my people.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00180</h1>

<p>If you expect us to place the welfare of a foreign power above our own, you're going to be sorely disappointed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00190</h1>

<p>Lest you doubt, Limsa comes first, then the Alliance, and finally─circumstances permitting─Ishgard and the rest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00200</h1>

<p>If you cannot understand so simple a concept, then you have no place at this table.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00210</h1>

<p>Forgive me, Admiral. I was...careless in my choice of words.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00220</h1>

<p>I suggest you assemble a party of elite adventurers, assuming you haven't already. Your fellows served us well during Operation Archon. I daresay they will do so again.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00230</h1>

<p>If I may, Your Grace, I wish to propose a redistribution of forces.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00240</h1>

<p>If we entrust the security of Ul'dah to the Brass Blades for a time, we can dispatch a larger force to Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00250</h1>

<p>Your Grace?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00260</h1>

<p>Yes, yes of course. Do what you will.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00270</h1>

<p>Is Her Grace not feeling well?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00280</h1>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, Her Grace is in perfect health.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00290</h1>

<p>I see. Carry on.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00010</h1>

<p>O Sultantree, hallowed spirit of my line...</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00020</h1>

<p>Through my weakness, the glorious House of Ul has all but disappeared beneath the sands. For want of the strength to raise it up again, it were better that it fall.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00030</h1>

<p>Forgive me, but I know not what else to do...</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00010</h1>

<p>You needn't trouble yourself so.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00020</h1>

<p>Your Grace is most kind, but it is no trouble to me, rather an honor.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00030</h1>

<p>If Your Grace is ready, I shall summon the Warrior of Light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00040</h1>

<p>I am.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00010</h1>

<p>I take it you have grown accustomed to your responsibilities?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00020</h1>

<p>The day-to-day duties are not so demanding. The social obligations, on the other hand...</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00030</h1>

<p> Everyone looks to be in high spirits.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00040</h1>

<p>With good cause.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00050</h1>

<p>A common victory may serve to unite even the most unlikely of allies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00060</h1>

<p>You've brought us one step closer to a united Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00070</h1>

<p>Your modesty knows no bounds, Antecedent.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00080</h1>

<p>Were it not for your efforts, Ser Aymeric would never have become such a steadfast ally.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00090</h1>

<p>When he convinces his countrymen to rejoin the Alliance, we shall all reap the benefits─military and economic.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00100</h1>

<p>I tell you, we are on the cusp of a new era of unity and prosperity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00110</h1>

<p>Territorial disputes are all that divide us now.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00120</h1>

<p>But I have faith that we will find an amicable solution in time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00130</h1>

<p>And failing that, I'll have my trusty Warrior of Light box the ears of all concerned. Speaking of whom...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00140</h1>

<p>She will be joining us shortly. A matter at the Quicksand required her attention, but it did not sound serious.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00010</h1>

<p>Enter.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00020</h1>

<p>Your Grace. Your guest has arrived.</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00030</h1>

<p>Pray come in, and take your ease.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00010</h1>

<p>'Tis well that the Steps of Faith held against the Horde.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00020</h1>

<p>And what of the city proper?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00030</h1>

<p>We sustained some few losses, but the heart of our nation yet beats with vigor. I am not certain I could say the same had we not received your most generous aid.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00040</h1>

<p>An attack on Ishgard is an attack on the realm. We stand together or fall divided.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00050</h1>

<p>Such noble words...after the fact.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00060</h1>

<p>I had hoped to speak in the presence of Her Grace, but it seems she has been delayed... That being the case, now would seem as good a time as any...</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00070</h1>

<p>Honored friends! Pray allow me to convey Ishgard's warmest gratitude for your part in the defense of our lands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00080</h1>

<p>'Tis upon the success of this very alliance that my recommendation to throw open the Gates of Judgement shall be founded. With the blessing of the archbishop, it is my hope that Ishgard will soon be reunited with her long-estranged sister nations─and that Eorzea shall once more be as one!</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00090</h1>

<p>Very well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00100</h1>

<p>Is aught amiss?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00110</h1>

<p>Nothing to worry about. I shall return anon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00120</h1>

<p>You wished a word, Yuyuhase?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00010</h1>

<p>You may go.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00020</h1>

<p>Your Grace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00030</h1>

<p>You must be curious as to the reason for this private audience. The matter I would discuss, however, will soon make apparent the need for discretion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00040</h1>

<p>I intend to abdicate the throne and dissolve the monarchy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00050</h1>

<p>You have seen for yourself the storm of turmoil that howls through our streets. The government fails in its responsibilities, and my subjects suffer the consequences of our incompetence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00060</h1>

<p>But I will see them suffer no longer. The victory feast shall provide the stage on which I declare the dissolution of the sultanate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00070</h1>

<p>'Tis mine intent that the ruling class of our golden city should take its place beside the common man in a fair and equitable republic. No more shall this nation bow to the whims of a privileged few.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00080</h1>

<p>Yet that which I propose will entail the tearing up of this city's very foundations. And even Raubahn with all his strength and influence will be hard-pressed to keep his footing on such treacherous ground.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00090</h1>

<p>Thus would I ask you to lend him a steadying hand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00100</h1>

<p>You who have endured the wrath of innumerable foes are the one hero in whom I can place my trust. Will you do this thing for me?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00110</h1>

<p>I am truly grateful. More grateful than I can well express.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00120</h1>

<p>How much we have both changed since that day we met beneath the Sultantree... And the days ahead promise to change us further still. I hope that we will recognize ourselves when all of this is over...</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00130</h1>

<p>Much of my dread for the coming days has been quieted...</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00140</h1>

<p>Your Grace!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00150</h1>

<p>Her Grace... The sultana is dead.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00160</h1>

<p>Poison in her wine...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00170</h1>

<p>You! You did this!</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00180</h1>

<p>Spare us your denials! I see no other suspects, and the room has but the one entrance!</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00190</h1>

<p>I hereby accuse you of regicide! Men─arrest this viper!</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00200</h1>

<p>(-Brass Blade-)Sir! You're coming with us!</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00010</h1>

<p><gasp></p>

<br/>
<h1>L00020</h1>

<p>(-Crystal Brave-)Sir. Barring a few exceptions, we have detained all those with allegiance to the Scions. The Rising Stones is also under our control.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00030</h1>

<p>And what do you hope to achieve with this mutiny?</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00040</h1>

<p>Why, that which we have striven for all along, Commander: the salvation of Eorzea.</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00010</h1>

<p>What is the meaning of this?</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00020</h1>

<p>Knights from the homeland? This cannot bode well...</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00030</h1>

<p>Lord Commander. We have received an urgent message from the Holy See.</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00040</h1>

<p>I am grieved to report that your serpentine foes have resumed their assault. Needless to say, your presence is urgently required. These knights have come to bear you swiftly home to Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00050</h1>

<p>...A surprise attack?</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00060</h1>

<p>We've had no such word from our men. And the timing is most fortuitous to catch us away from the city...</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00070</h1>

<p>Most fortuitous indeed...</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00080</h1>

<p>Lord Commander, we must away!</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00090</h1>

<p>You have been a most gracious host. I hope that I might one day return the favor.</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00100</h1>

<p>Come, Lucia.</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00010</h1>

<p>Whatever is going on in there...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00020</h1>

<p>Ah, the ever-dutiful Brass Blades. I must apologize, but my dance card is rather full. Another time, perhaps?</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00030</h1>

<p>Thancred of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. You stand accused of committing acts of espionage in service to the Garlean Empire.</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00040</h1>

<p>Espionage? What in the seven hells are you talking about?</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00050</h1>

<p>Ah. If you're referring to that business with the Ultima Weapon, then you must understand─I-I wasn't myself...</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00060</h1>

<p>Under interrogation, an imperial prisoner revealed your involvement in numerous dealings with the enemy. We've also been investigating reports that you are a practitioner of forbidden arts.</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00070</h1>

<p>You'd best come along with us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00080</h1>

<p>You invite me to your party and now you want me to leave? I do so detest receiving mixed signals.</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00090</h1>

<p>Come, then. I believe I've lost my appetite for this farce of a celebration!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00010</h1>

<p>You go too far, Lord Adeledji! By what right do you march armed soldiers into a royal banquet and eject state visitors without Her Grace's consent!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00020</h1>

<p>You treat the Brass Blades as your personal army, and show contempt for the throne with your every act. Leave us. Now.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00030</h1>

<p>Is that an order, General? Mayhap you have mistaken me for one of your Flames? You will find I am not so slavishly obedient. And you lecture me on personal armies!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00040</h1>

<p>As for your outrageous claim that I have shown contempt for the throne, let all here observe that it was not I who feasted while an assassin removed its occupant!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00050</h1>

<p>I expect this is your idea of defending the nation, is it? This and diluting our forces through these distractions in Carteneau and Coerthas!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00060</h1>

<p>I do begin to see how the ranks of the Immortal Flames came to be riddled with Garlean sympathizers! You are plainly unfit for command!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00070</h1>

<p>Wait... Wait, gods damn you! Your words make no sense. What assassin?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00080</h1>

<p>You mean to say you don't know!? We caught the vaunted champion of the Scions in Her Grace's private chambers not moments after the deed was done!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00090</h1>

<p>No─ No, this cannot be!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00100</h1>

<p>Save your breath. You will need it to plead your case. You and your entire order are to be tried for this atrocity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00110</h1>

<p>Bring in the prisoner!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00010</h1>

<p>This woman stands accused of poisoning Her Royal Majesty Nanamo Ul Namo. And as suspected accessories to the crime, all members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn will be detained for questioning!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00020</h1>

<p>This is madness!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00030</h1>

<p>What a pity... Who'd have thought your tale would end like this?</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00040</h1>

<p>Should you demand further proof, a vial with traces of the substance used to poison Her Grace was found upon the assassin's person.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00050</h1>

<p>How very convenient.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00060</h1>

<p>You would speak of convenience?</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00070</h1>

<p>Who persuaded Her Grace to host this celebration? A diversion which presented you and your confederates ample opportunity to commit the crime, and a crowd within which to fade from view! A more “convenient” occasion I could scarcely imagine!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00080</h1>

<p>How dare you! After all we have done for Ul'dah!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00090</h1>

<p>Hold your tongue, witch! I'll not be ensorcelled! I know all about the dark gift that you and your disciples wield!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00100</h1>

<p>Oh, yes...I've observed how you worked upon the minds of the Alliance leaders, bending them to your will!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00110</h1>

<p>And what of your cordial relationship with Ser Aymeric? For years, Ishgard abjured all contact with the outside world, and now the lord commander of the Temple Knights treats you with the familiarity of a childhood friend!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00120</h1>

<p>I'll tell you what I think─I think this desperate defense of Ishgard was but a ruse to deceive us into dividing our forces.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00130</h1>

<p>Your next move will be to charm your Coerthan allies into invading our lands!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00140</h1>

<p>Now that is truly ridiculous.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00150</h1>

<p>How do you even think of this stuff!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00160</h1>

<p>She... She cannot be dead...</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00170</h1>

<p>Stand aside, Ilberd! I want to see the sultana!</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00180</h1>

<p>Spare yourself the pain, brother. I saw her with my own eyes.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00190</h1>

<p>For a mercy, the poison took her swiftly─her handmaiden can attest to that.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00200</h1>

<p>This cannot be...</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00210</h1>

<p>Nanamo... Nanamo... NOOOOOO!!!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00010</h1>

<p>Plainly, the Royalists can no longer be relied upon to keep our nation safe. And so it falls to the Monetarists of the Syndicate to govern Ul'dah. But should you wish to help us, General, we would be more than happy to entrust the task of planning Her Grace's funeral to you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00020</h1>

<p>It seems only right that you should bury your precious sultana, and we will be glad to be rid of that burden.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00030</h1>

<p>I'll bet you will. You more than any man.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00040</h1>

<p>...Whatever do you mean?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00050</h1>

<p>I mean you had her killed, you black-hearted bastard!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00060</h1>

<p>What rot! ...Though I did have sufficient motive, 'tis true. That young lady caused me no end of grief.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00070</h1>

<p>She always was a most unwilling puppet. I daresay Her Grace was grateful that someone thought to cut her strings.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00080</h1>

<p>You would mock her? THEN MOCK HER FROM HELL!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00090</h1>

<p>Wha─</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00100</h1>

<p>Have you lost your mind, General!? It is forbidden to draw steel in the royal chambers, much less slaughter our fellow Syndicate members!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00110</h1>

<p><gasp> ...You're one of them! You've been in league with the Scions all along!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00120</h1>

<p>YOU! You're next, you scheming bastard!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00130</h1>

<p>AAARRRGH!!!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00140</h1>

<p>Seven hells!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00150</h1>

<p>Raubahn!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00160</h1>

<p>(-Maelstrom Soldier-)Admiral, we must leave!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00180</h1>

<p>How unlike you, old friend. I did not expect to take your arm so easily.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00230</h1>

<p>Take the Scions into custody! They have conspired to commit regicide!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00240</h1>

<p>And arrest this traitor as well!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00190</h1>

<p>Ilberd! I hope you choke on their coin!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00200</h1>

<p>'Tis better than the dirt I've supped on these long years. We can't all abandon Ala Mhigo and become great war heroes as you have.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00210</h1>

<p>You are not the man you once were, Raubahn. Since that girl strapped the yoke around your neck, you've become docile.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00220</h1>

<p>She took the mad bull and cut off his balls. And a bull that cannot rut is fit for naught but slaughter.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00250</h1>

<p>Shall I tell you who really killed your precious sultana?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00251</h1>

<p>...It was me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00260</h1>

<p>You! You die!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00270</h1>

<p>Hmph.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00280</h1>

<p>I never doubted you. Not for a moment. But there is more to this than I yet understand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00290</h1>

<p>Flee this place. Clear your names.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00300</h1>

<p>Find out who is behind this plot! It is the only way! Now go!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00310</h1>

<p>Yaaaaaargh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00320</h1>

<p>Ah, there you are!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00330</h1>

<p>Thancred! Where have you been?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00340</h1>

<p>Avoiding the fumbling advances of some very persistent admirers.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00341</h1>

<p>When I realized the celebrations had turned sour, it seemed prudent to slip away and take stock of the situation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00350</h1>

<p>'Twould appear that much of the city is already under tight guard. It occurs to me that expanding the Brass Blades' authority may not have been such a wonderful idea after all...</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00360</h1>

<p>The success of this plan was contingent upon those thugs having the run of the place. Just how long has this scheme been in motion?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00370</h1>

<p>The careful preparations, the maneuvering of forces... I am inclined to agree with the General's insistence that a deeper plot exists here.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00380</h1>

<p>So...would I be right in thinking we now have an excuse to pummel as many Brass Blades as we like?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00390</h1>

<p>Unless you plan on pummeling them all, I'm not sure that will greatly aid our cause.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00400</h1>

<p>The sultana's assassination was but one part of the scheme. We too were its targets. And though we did not share poor Nanamo's fate, we are yet hobbled by the charges laid at our door. Where now might we seek refuge?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00410</h1>

<p>Where indeed. We may safely assume that our foe has thought to have the Rising Stones watched.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00420</h1>

<p>Forgive me for stating the obvious, but our choice of destination will matter little if we cannot secure an escape route out of Ul'dah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00430</h1>

<p>Happily, I believe I can provide one. Papashan once told me about the passages hidden in the walls of the palace. If I recall correctly, the fireplace in Nanamo's chambers conceals the entrance to a tunnel.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00440</h1>

<p>It should lead outside the city, and allow us to avoid any messy confrontations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00450</h1>

<p>The rest of you go on ahead. I'll handle this lot!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00460</h1>

<p>By yourself!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00461</h1>

<p><sigh> ...I suppose I shall just have to join you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00480</h1>

<p>Crystal Braves, too, huh? Now this should be interesting!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00470</h1>

<p>Yda! Papalymo!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00490</h1>

<p>We will hold our pursuers here. Hurry, now! Find this tunnel of Thancred's!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00500</h1>

<p>Minfilia! We cannot linger!</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00010</h1>

<p>Ow! Now look what you've done!</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00020</h1>

<p>Yda, are you all right!? There are just too many of them...</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00030</h1>

<p>I'm fine! I could do this all day! How about you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00040</h1>

<p>...Nearing the end of my tether.</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00050</h1>

<p>This is so stupid! We're the Scions of the Seventh Dawn! The ones who stand between this realm and the evil that's trying to destroy it!</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00060</h1>

<p>And if you think we'll leave the stewardship of Eorzea to the likes of your masters, then you're sorely mistaken!</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00070</h1>

<p>Sorry I dragged you into this, Papalymo...</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00080</h1>

<p>Hah, 'tis hardly the first time. And I'll be damned if it will be the last.</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00090</h1>

<p>Let them have it, Yda!</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00100</h1>

<p>I was hoping you'd say that!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00010</h1>

<p>I never knew such a watercourse existed beneath Ul'dah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00020</h1>

<p>The architecture is of the Sil'dihn style, if I am not mistaken. The ancients plainly foresaw the need for a ready means of escape.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00030</h1>

<p>(-???-)This way!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00040</h1>

<p>Well, that didn't take long. It seems these tunnels were not as secret as I had hoped.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00050</h1>

<p>You two go on ahead. Thancred and I will deal with this.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00060</h1>

<p>Wh-What do you mean to do!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00070</h1>

<p>Only that which is required to ensure that the dawn's light survive to brighten the morrow.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00080</h1>

<p>Fear not, Antecedent. You haven't seen the last of these fair features.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00090</h1>

<p>My friends...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00100</h1>

<p>Leave us!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00110</h1>

<p>What is the plan, milady? Shall I take the dozen on the left, and you the dozen on the right? The odds are not exactly stacked in our favor...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00120</h1>

<p>Numbers will count for little when I bring the tunnel down upon their heads. Though I cannot say I relish the thought of being entombed with you for all eternity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00130</h1>

<p>You wound me! I will have you know that many a maid would kill for the chance to spend forever at my side! Now, may I have the last dance?</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00140</h1>

<p>Ugh!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00150</h1>

<p>Well, this is going splendidly... Now would be a good time, milady!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00160</h1>

<p>'Tis done!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00170</h1>

<p>Forgive me, Mhitra...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00180</h1>

<p>Farewell, Minfilia...</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00010</h1>

<p>Hydaelyn... She speaks to me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00020</h1>

<p>No!</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00030</h1>

<p>I must remain behind...but you cannot stay with me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00040</h1>

<p>Please, you must go on! You are the Warrior of Light! You are hope─for the Scions, and for all the realm!</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00050</h1>

<p>As long as your flame continues to burn, the light of the dawn may ever be relit!</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00060</h1>

<p>You must escape, and save Eorzea from those who would plunge it into darkness!</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00070</h1>

<p>'Tis the only way...</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00010</h1>

<p>I am glad to see you safe, my friend! What of the others?</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00020</h1>

<p>Damn that man!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00030</h1>

<p>Teledji played me for a fool! I thought the Crystal Braves mine till the very moment I felt the blade at my back...</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00040</h1>

<p>(-???-)There will be ample time for soul-searching later. For now, we must put some malms between us and Ul'dah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00050</h1>

<p>Well, if it ain't the hero of the Scions! You look to me like a woman in need of a nice, relaxin' carriage ride!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00060</h1>

<p>Well, would you look who it is! Need a ride? I doubt it'll be half as excitin' as the last trip we took─not if I have anythin' to say about it, anyway!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00070</h1>

<p>Let's not dawdle, eh? All aboard!</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00010</h1>

<p>I was stockin' up on supplies over in Vesper Bay, you see, when your sister come up an' begged a favor. Said her brother was havin' some trouble down in Ul'dah, an' likely needed a helpin' hand gettin' away.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00020</h1>

<p>Thinkin' them ruins would make a fine hidin' place, I decided to try there first...an' lo an' behold, there you were.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00030</h1>

<p>Aye, an' judgin' by them soldiers as were pourin' out of the city, I arrived not a moment too soon...</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00040</h1>

<p>Must've been fate that we happened to find you there though, eh?</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00050</h1>

<p>I had thought to look out for Alisaie, but 'twould appear she was the one watching over me. I've made such a mess of things...</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00060</h1>

<p>An' who might you be, young sir?</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00070</h1>

<p>Pipin Tarupin, Vice Marshal of the Immortal Flames.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00080</h1>

<p>I had been on the Ala Mhigan front these past few moons, but an urgent communication called me back to Ul'dah.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00090</h1>

<p>Scarce had my boots touched the cobbles, though, when the streets erupted with cries of assassination. I immediately went in search of answers, and came across Master Alphinaud here. Needless to say, I did not think his imprisonment justified.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00100</h1>

<p>The blame plainly lies with the Monetarists. Their greed and corruption are well known to me, but for them to take advantage of the situation with such alacrity...</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00110</h1>

<p>...Was that “Pipin,” you said? Ain't that the name of General Aldynn's lad?</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00120</h1>

<p>Yes, I am his son. Adopted, of course. 'Twas only as we were leaving Ul'dah that I learned of Father's fate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00130</h1>

<p>Once I have seen you a safe distance away, I mean to return to the city and extricate him from this madness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00140</h1>

<p>Then you needn't travel no further than Black Brush─our fugitives have a friend waitin' for 'em there.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00150</h1>

<p>I dreamed of bringing about Eorzea's salvation, but in the end...</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00160</h1>

<p>'Twas I who needed saving.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00010</h1>

<p>There has been word from the capital. Ishgard has weathered another assault, and 'tis said several wyverns broke through into the city proper.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00020</h1>

<p>The Temple Knights succeeded in slaying the beasts, but the intrusion prompted orders to further strengthen the guard and to place the city under a perpetual state of alert.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00030</h1>

<p>How keenly we feel the loss of our wards at the Gates of Judgement...</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00040</h1>

<p>Yet we must not bemoan our misfortune. Ser Aymeric is safely returned from Ul'dah and once more leads the defense of Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00050</h1>

<p>As for the matter of your asylum, I am afraid no progress will be made until the threat to our nation has diminished.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00060</h1>

<p>But do not despair! You are not without allies.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00070</h1>

<p>You are more than welcome to shelter here for as long as you wish. Pray think of it as a new headquarters of sorts─the “Falling Snows” or some such!</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00080</h1>

<p>All frivolity aside, any who come here in search of you will receive no aid from House Fortemps. For once, the Ishgardian reputation for inhospitality shall work in our favor.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00090</h1>

<p>Agents of Ul'dah will find their every inquiry dismissed, and their every request for entry rebuffed, until such time as their masters have acknowledged your innocence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00100</h1>

<p>You once fought to preserve the honor of my dear friend─'tis a blessing that I may now repay that debt in kind.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00110</h1>

<p>But let us dwell no more on this. Pray join the rest of your companions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>W00120</h1>

<p>'Tis bitterly cold this day. I suspect there are those who might welcome the warmth your presence brings.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00010</h1>

<p>'Tis all my doing...</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00020</h1>

<p>I believed myself the only one who truly understood Eorzea's woes. And look what that arrogance has wrought.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00030</h1>

<p>I gave commands, influenced governments with my certainty...</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00040</h1>

<p>I treated the Crystal Braves, and even the Scions themselves, as pawns in my great scheme to save the realm.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00050</h1>

<p>But in my headlong rush unto imagined glory, I paid no heed to the ground upon which I trod!</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00060</h1>

<p>The salvation of Eorzea... What was it that I hoped to achieve?</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00070</h1>

<p>Did I believe that I could rid the realm of every danger and difficulty? That I could defeat the Empire and the Ascians, and find homes for every refugee?</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00080</h1>

<p>Oh yes, I was so very clever. “Become a guardian of Eorzea,” I implored, and sat back to watch my perfect army cleanse the land of chaos.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00090</h1>

<p>'Twas all but a means to feed my own vanity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00100</h1>

<p>Only when all is lost do I finally realize the truth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00110</h1>

<p>Oh, Alphinaud...</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00120</h1>

<p>So, Master Alphinaud, are you content to remain a broken blade? Is there no flame hot enough to reforge you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00130</h1>

<p>What of the fine companions who yet stand at your side? I daresay the fires of their determination will soon have you slicing the air again with your customary wit!</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00140</h1>

<p>I hardly deserve such friendship. And besides, where are we to go...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00150</h1>

<p>Alphinaud? If I may...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00160</h1>

<p>Should this place not serve our purpose, then...then we shall go to Ishgard!</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00170</h1>

<p>Minfilia told me many times: as long as we stand fast against despair, the beacon of hope will never be lost to sight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00180</h1>

<p>Be it in the snow or in the clouds, we few will see that the dawn's light shines again!</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00190</h1>

<p><sniff> <sniff></p>

<br/>
<h1>X00200</h1>

<p>You are right, Tataru, thank you. And thank you for your kind words, Lord Haurchefant.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00210</h1>

<p>'Tis true that Eorzea yet has her guardians.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00220</h1>

<p>The Scions have achieved much, and 'twould be remiss of me to discard it all in a fit of self-pity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>X00230</h1>

<p>Let us then resume our journey, together...one step at a time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Y00010</h1>

<p>All has been arranged as you desired, my lord.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Y00020</h1>

<p>Hmph.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Z00010</h1>

<p>Heh heh heh. Thou thinkest sanctuary lieth beyond?</p>

<br/>
<h1>Z00020</h1>

<p>Delusion. Despair. Death. Thou shalt find naught else here.</p>

<h1>000080</h1>

<p>Gilgamesh is in the mood...for dancing!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>Divide and conquer, Gilgamesh style!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>...And now for something truly shocking!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>What's the matter, friend? All tied up?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>Uh-oh! Someone just woke the dragon...</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>You have some skill, I'll give you that...<br/>
But Gilgamesh has only just begun to fight!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>Most impressive!<br/>
Very well─I, too, shall fight with all my strength!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>No! The mighty Gilgamesh will not be defeated!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>At long last, we meet again on the battlefield!<br/>
I daresay Enkidu shall come to enjoy our tussles as much as I.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>You, however, might not find this one so enjoyable.<br/>
...Unless you enjoy getting pounded senseless. Hah!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>Me? Run away? Hah! I-I was but seeking out a<br/>
more suitable spot to celebrate my inevitable victory!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>But enough exposition! Now we fight like men!<br/>
And ladies! And ladies who dress like men!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>For Gilgamesh...it is transmogrifying time!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>The mightiest warrior ever to grace Eorzea stands before you─<br/>
by which I mean I, Gilgamesh! Prepare yourself!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>To think that my full complement of arms would avail me naught...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>No more high jinks from Gilgamesh. You have my word.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>The Treaty-Blade, too, I shall return.<br/>
...Just as soon as I remember where I hid it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>Anyway, I yield to your unparalleled puissance!<br/>
Spare my insignificant life, I beg of you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>...NOT! Ha, I lied...again! Like a rug! Oh, I kill me!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>You can take that fusty old blade for all I care! I thirst for true<br/>
power, and naught save the strongest of swords will suffice!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>Warrior of Light─you have proven a worthy opponent.<br/>
But I warn you─treasure every moment with your weapon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>For as sure as day follows night, the hour will come when<br/>
I claim it as mine own! Till we meet again!</p>

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>So long as we have these specious accusations hanging over us, we will struggle to achieve anything.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>You must go to Ishgard, as Tataru proposed. I will return to Ul'dah and set things right.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>Pray do not be so hasty, Master Alphinaud.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>Lord Haurchefant?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>Full well do I understand your desire to clear your names.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>But now is not the time for drastic action. You yet have allies upon whom you can rely. There is no need to act alone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>Yes...yes, of course. Pray forgive my impatience.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>I bring tidings. Count Edmont has decreed that the three of you be taken in as wards of House Fortemps. Under our patronage, you shall be granted access to the city proper.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>Pray consider our manor your new headquarters, from which you may gather information and plan how best to proceed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>Needless to say, should any of your missing allies be found─as I am certain they shall─they will of course be welcome to join you there.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>You are more than generous, my friend. On behalf of my fellows, I humbly accept your offer of hospitality.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>The count is a good man and just. He will treat you with the kindness and respect that a hero─and dear friend─deserves.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>To Ishgard, then─together.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>There we shall carry on the Scions' legacy. There we shall begin anew.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000160</h1>

<p>Hear, hear!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>And so they came, at a friend's behest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>Heroes once celebrated as saviors of Eorzea, brought low through treachery,<br/>
their names blackened with royal blood...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>With memories of the lost and dreams of redemption,<br/>
with hope yet in their hearts, they came...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>To Ishgard, shining city on the mount, overlooking the dominion of Coerthas...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>A great and proud nation devoted to Halone, the Fury, ruled by Thordan VII,<br/>
Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>The last bastion of the Faith, her walls ever bristling with<br/>
the sworn swords and spears of her four High Houses...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>A land that after a thousand years of war<br/>
had forgotten what it was to be at peace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>Through gates long closed the Warrior of Light and her companions passed,<br/>
entering at last a city whose history was written in blood.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>In the midst of the Dragonsong War they came─three weary travelers<br/>
whose arrival would set in motion great change...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>Though none knew then how great...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>From the memoirs of Count Edmont de Fortemps<br/>
Heavensward</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>My lord, I have returned with the Scions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>I hope your journey was not too taxing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>I, Count Edmont de Fortemps, do bid you welcome.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>As wards of House Fortemps, you shall be afforded every courtesy. My home is your home.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>My companions and I are deeply honored, Count Fortemps.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>The honor is mine, Master Alphinaud. Consider it an expression of our gratitude for your service to Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>Forgive me, my lord, but...are you not concerned? To accept foreign guests at such a juncture─especially ones with our...reputation...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>Do not worry yourself on my account. 'Tis true that Ishgard's first thought has ever been the war effort, hence the closing of our borders...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>...Yet it is in troubled times most of all that men should seek allies, don't you think?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>Granted, my decision will have raised eyebrows in the Vault and in the halls of the other High Houses.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>But so long as you continue with your altruistic endeavors, I doubt my honored peers will feel moved to voice their concerns.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300120</h1>

<p>Then there is naught to fear. Though our numbers are much reduced, we are no less determined to carry on our work.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300130</h1>

<p>Full glad am I to hear it. Ah, but before you return to your labors, why not take a tour of the city?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300140</h1>

<p>You would do well, I think, to acquaint yourselves with your new surroundings. After all, you may be here for some time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>To the frozen wastes of the western highlands,<br/>
once verdant tracts made pallid by the Calamity...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>Beyond the towering wall of ice, to lands long forsaken<br/>
that the knights of Ishgard strove tirelessly to reclaim...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>To the hamlet of Falcon's Nest, once abandoned,<br/>
now freed of its pall of snow and ash, she came...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Looking for me, I presume.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500020</h1>

<p>Ahhh, the child who glimpsed the truth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500030</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)No, it cannot be!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500040</h1>

<p>She cameth unto me, as didst thou.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500050</h1>

<p>Alike in gifts, yet set upon different paths.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500060</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)He speaks true, Warrior of Light. Like you, I have been blessed with the Echo.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500070</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)The visions terrified me at first. They came without warning. I wondered what I had done to deserve them...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500080</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)But I had no time to ponder such things once the Calamity came.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500090</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)The land turned against us, and in a matter of hours, Falcon's Nest was buried under ten fulms of ice and snow. We had no choice but to flee for Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500100</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)We came to the wall, and while we searched for a way through, there was an avalanche. And then I was alone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500110</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)So I set forth for Dravania. I knew full well what might happen were I found, but I could not survive on my own.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500120</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I was found, of course─and not by a mere dragon, but by the great wyrm Hraesvelgr!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500130</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)And it was then that I knew why I had been given this gift, for with it I heard his voice, and saw the truth through his eyes!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500140</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I was chosen to deliver this revelation to the people─to bring dragon and man together, as they once were, and should ever be!</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q1</h1>

<p>What will you say?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A1</h1>

<p>Killing civilians won't bring them together!<br/>
What of the innocents who died when you attacked Foundation?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500150</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)It wasn't supposed to be like that! You have to believe me! It was...beyond my control...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500160</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Children taught to fear the skies, who saw their loved ones slaughtered...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500170</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Yet the Dravanians─though they know where the fault truly lies─fell upon them with such fury...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500180</h1>

<p>Men die, and their children forget. But we are everlasting. To us, then is as now.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500190</h1>

<p>Thou canst not comprehend the violation. The outrage. The fury.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500200</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I will make this right.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500210</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I am neither a saint nor a savior─just another sinner. Yet I will not forsake this cause. I cannot. I will see this cycle broken and peace restored.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500220</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)I... We can do naught else, for we are now as one...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>Upon an airship conceived within the fecund mind of Cid Garlond,<br/>
renegade prodigy of Garlemald who had come to call Eorzea home...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>High into the heavens where isles of earth and stone floated as clouds─<br/>
a frontier the knights of Ishgard had scarce begun to explore...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>To a fledgling outpost within the Sea of Clouds where careworn scouts<br/>
ever scanned the skies for winged shadows, she came...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>Reinforcements!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>Anger of Honu, chief of mighty Vundu, roils like blackest storm clouds!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>Offer netherlings to the White! Cloud sea swells and He comes!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700040</h1>

<p>The White! The White! Mighty Bismarck, Lord of the Mists!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700050</h1>

<p>A flying whale!? By the Fury, i-it's a primal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700060</h1>

<p>We must away!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700070</h1>

<p>Damn!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700080</h1>

<p>Bloody typical... All right─we're going in!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700090</h1>

<p>(-Biggs and Wedge-)Aye aye, chief!</p>

<br/>
<h1>700100</h1>

<p>All aboard!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800010</h1>

<p>The hero returns! I cannot thank you enough for saving young Emmanellain's life. Aye, aye─he told me everything.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800020</h1>

<p>I've also received letters from both House Dzemael and Durendaire praising your conduct─and that of House Fortemps. You've won us much honor, my friend.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800030</h1>

<p>My lord!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800040</h1>

<p>What is it? Speak.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800050</h1>

<p>Pray forgive the intrusion, my lord, but I-I bring grave tidings!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800060</h1>

<p>Master Alphinaud and Mistress Tataru have been detained on suspicion of fomenting heresy!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800070</h1>

<p>What? Explain!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800080</h1>

<p>They...they were observed entering a tavern in the lower levels on some half-dozen occasions. There, it is claimed, they made a number of inquiries...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800090</h1>

<p>Inquiries which brought them into contact with certain...ahem...elements. 'Twas this which prompted a knight of the Heavens' Ward to demand that they be questioned. Ser Grinnaux, my lord...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800100</h1>

<p>Ser Grinnaux is a brute─an exceedingly accomplished brute, but a brute nonetheless. Alas, he is also a son of House Dzemael.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800110</h1>

<p>How quickly we forget the petty nature of men. I'd wager your friends are no more than pawns in another of my countrymen's games. Such is the way of things between the High Houses...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>We are gathered here today, under the watchful gaze of the Fury, to ascertain the guilt of two souls in a trial by combat! Petitioners, step forward!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>Ser Grinnaux─for the benefit of all here present, I would ask you to repeat the charges which you have leveled against this man and this woman.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>I, Ser Grinnaux de Dzemael, brother of the Heavens' Ward, did bear witness to these two foreigners consorting with heretics!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900040</h1>

<p>Let the accused step forward!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900050</h1>

<p>Alphinaud Leveilleur, Tataru Taru─you have heard the charges leveled against you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900060</h1>

<p>Will you take up arms to refute Ser Grinnaux's claim and thereby prove your innocence in the eyes of gods and men?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900070</h1>

<p>I, Alphinaud Leveilleur, am innocent of this charge, and claim my right to trial by combat!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900080</h1>

<p>I, Tataru Taru, am innocent of this charge...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900090</h1>

<p>But I am no warrior, and cannot fight, so I claim the right to name a champion!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900100</h1>

<p>To the old and the infirm, the young and the weak, this right we allow. Very well. Who will stand for this woman?</p>

<br/>
<h1>900110</h1>

<p>Just as I was beginning to doubt the efficacy of the Ishgardian justice system! Come, my friend─let us put an end to this mummer's farce!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900120</h1>

<p>O Halone, render unto us Your judgment! Raise up the righteous, and cast down the wicked!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00010</h1>

<p>Your Eminence, it is my honor to present to you the Warrior of Light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00020</h1>

<p>I have heard the tales of your many grand endeavors. The lord commander has also been most effusive in his praise.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00030</h1>

<p>I am Thordan VII, Archbishop of the Ishgardian Orthodox Church, and I bade you come here that I might offer my personal apologies. </p>

<br/>
<h1>A00040</h1>

<p>You will forgive me for not calling upon you as courtesy would dictate, but as you can see, my more sprightly days are long behind me. But I digress.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00050</h1>

<p>Your companions were wrongly accused of heresy and subjected to gross indignities. This, I am sorry to say, was the result of negligence on the part of our nation's protectors─negligence born of an excess of zeal. Is that not so, Ser Zephirin?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00060</h1>

<p>Yes, Your Eminence... Regrettably, it would appear that we of the Heavens' Ward were in receipt of erroneous information.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00070</h1>

<p>Ser Grinnaux has ever been headstrong. He pressed charges before the truth had been ascertained, for which I most sincerely apologize.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00080</h1>

<p>An unfortunate misunderstanding born of an earnest desire to serve Ishgard─but one which should never have occurred...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00090</h1>

<p>For who could doubt the character of those who bested Shiva and drove the Horde from the Steps of Faith? Not I, that much is certain.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00100</h1>

<p>That will be all, Ser Zephirin. I would speak with our guest in private.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00110</h1>

<p>Your Eminence? I─</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00120</h1>

<p>As you wish, Your Eminence. That will be all for today!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00130</h1>

<p>Privacy is a luxury rarely afforded one in my position.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00140</h1>

<p>Now, tell me, young lady: what do you know of the Ascians?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00150</h1>

<p>Much and more, I shouldn't wonder, being the Bringer of Light. You should know that I myself have met with them─have entertained them as guests, even.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00160</h1>

<p>Those harbingers of chaos and strife offered us power, that we might continue our war against the dragons.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00170</h1>

<p>I have no intention of aiding their cause, of course, nor less of being their puppet.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00180</h1>

<p>Yet were I to refuse them outright, I should learn naught of their true objectives and remain powerless to stop them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00190</h1>

<p>Thus have I hearkened to their words with interest, and paid lip service to their beliefs, biding my time and preparing for the inevitable conflict.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00200</h1>

<p>And why do I tell you this? Because there is naught in this world they fear more than the power of the Warrior of Light.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00210</h1>

<p>If we are to rid ourselves of these vile interlopers, we must needs work together. With our combined strength, I have faith that we can wrest Eorzea from their grasp, and pave the way for a lasting peace. Think on it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00010</h1>

<p>There you are. I confess, I was more than a little concerned when I learned that you had been summoned to the Vault. What did they want with you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00020</h1>

<p>Well, well. A formal apology and an admonishment of those responsible? I see my fears were wholly misplaced.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00030</h1>

<p>By the gods, the archbishop freely admits to consorting with Ascians? So their ambitions extend to Ishgard as well...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00040</h1>

<p>We will have new primals to contend with ere long, of that you may be certain. 'Tis but a matter of time. Yet shorn of the support of our missing allies, what can we realistically hope to achieve?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00050</h1>

<p>Ahhh! In the midst of all the excitement, I completely forgot to tell you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00060</h1>

<p>When I was asking around about the Scions, I heard the most awful rumor!</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00070</h1>

<p>General Raubahn is to be executed for crimes against the sultanate!</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00080</h1>

<p>If the Flame General dies, we will lose a staunch ally, and the one man capable of holding the sultana's assassins to account.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00090</h1>

<p>Lord Haurchefant was wise to counsel restraint, but this business will brook no delay.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00100</h1>

<p>We cannot permit this execution to take place. We must save Raubahn!</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[CUTSCENE]

3.0 Heavensward Cutscenes [VoiceMan_03002]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>Thankfully, we had allies there who took us under their wing. And theirs was not the only aid we received, I suspect.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>When we fled Ul'dah, we fully expected to become wanted men, known to all and hounded at every turn. Yet that did not come to pass. On the contrary, 'twould seem the charges against us have not been made public. Might we have you to thank for that, Admiral?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>Sharp as ever, Master Alphinaud. On Marshal Tarupin's urging, the Elder Seedseer and I demanded that the Syndicate suppress news of the Scions' alleged crimes until such time as irrefutable evidence could be found.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>Our argument was simple: lacking proof, to accuse the saviors of the realm of so unlikely a crime would have the people up in arms. In their wisdom, the Syndicate agreed, as you yourself have seen.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>There is something you should know. Some few days prior to the banquet, the Elder Seedseer and I were summoned for a private audience with the sultana.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>There, she revealed her intent to announce her abdication, that she might pave the way for the establishment of an Ul'dahn republic.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>What? But such an announcement would have plunged the entire nation into chaos!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>She was well aware of that. 'Twas for fear of what might ensue that she summoned us. Her Grace wanted the Elder Seedseer and I to lend Raubahn a helping hand, you see─to aid him in preserving the peace during the transition.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>So...having somehow caught wind of her plan, Lolorito and Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination in the hope of maintaining the constitutional status quo...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>But they must have known that her death would sow as much chaos as her abdication─chaos from which Teledji alone might feasibly stand to profit. Surely Lolorito would never knowingly─</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>Ah. Could it be...? I dare not hope...</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>The Ul'dahn authorities have yet to announce the sultana's passing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>To allay any suspicion that may arise from Her Grace's absence, they have issued a statement to the effect that she is presently convalescing from illness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>Mayhap they're waiting for a fitting moment to break the news. Or mayhap they know of some other reason to delay.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000160</h1>

<p>Something else has been bothering me, Admiral. I was dismayed to learn that General Raubahn is to be executed─yet upon hearing the news, I could not help but wonder why he had been kept alive for so long.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000170</h1>

<p>Pray mistake not my meaning─I am, of course, overjoyed that our friend still draws breath, and that he might yet be saved. But if his enemies truly wished to eliminate him, they could have done so immediately. I see no reason for this delay.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000180</h1>

<p>Aye... You've struck upon an important point, Master Alphinaud.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000190</h1>

<p>Following his capture, Raubahn had been held in the Marasaja Pit within Ul'dah. In recent days, however, he has reportedly been moved to an unknown location.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000200</h1>

<p>Queerly, 'twas not the Brass Blades who spirited him away, either, but a band of soldiers decked in blue...</p>

<br/>
<h1>000210</h1>

<p>The Crystal Braves.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000220</h1>

<p>Aye. If I read the winds aright, the arrangement between Lord Lolorito and the Braves has come under strain.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000230</h1>

<p>At any rate, if we're to rescue Raubahn, we'll have to find him first. And you'll be glad to hear that I have already entrusted the task to those best able to see it done─our friends of Doma.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>Pray forgive me my lateness.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>Lady Yugiri!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>Master Alphinaud. I am pleased to see that the light of resolve shines in your eyes once more.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100040</h1>

<p>Ah, yes... How pathetic I must have seemed to you when we last met. I am ashamed to recall it. For a time I was well and truly lost. But with the aid of my comrades, I have since refound my purpose, and I shall take care not to misplace it again.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100050</h1>

<p>Since your escape from Ul'dah, my fellow shinobi and I have shadowed the Crystal Braves' every step in hopes of learning the Scions' whereabouts.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100060</h1>

<p>Regrettably, our investigation has yet to yield any useful information. Pray forgive us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100070</h1>

<p>You need not apologize, my lady─we are grateful for all that you have done on our behalf. Besides, Raubahn is no less a friend, and we cannot well abandon him to his fate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100080</h1>

<p>Hozan─the three of us shall attend to the Flame General's rescue. Pray draw away the guards by the entrance. Take Doware and Higiri with you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100090</h1>

<p>With me!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>This changes nothing!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>It is over, Ilberd! Lay down your arms and surrender yourself to justice!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>Justice!? Justice for what exactly? 'Twas not I who assassinated the sultana, boy!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>Ere we debate who is responsible for the assassination, I would ask whether an assassination took place at all.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>Clever little shite...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>If you think you fight for justice, lass, you'd best wake up. The truth is, you fight for whoever bloody well tells you to. Can you not see you're being used!? By the Scions, the city–states, even the Crystal Braves. They none of 'em care a whit what you want─only what you can do for them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>And how do I know this? Because I'm the same─a pawn to be used as my masters see fit. All I ever wanted was to liberate my homeland, and I ate dirt to make it happen. But what have I achieved after all these years in servitude? Nothing! Not a bloody thing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>If we ourselves are not free─free to think and to act─how are we ever to reclaim our homeland? Know this: there is nothing I would not give to take back Ala Mhigo! NOTHING!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200090</h1>

<p>You'll not get away!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200100</h1>

<p>No, Master Alphinaud. Now is not the time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>I'm but a cripple and a fool, and still you came for me... I'm in your debt.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>We are all of us fools of fate, General. But even fools have a part to play.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q1</h1>

<p>What will you say to Raubahn?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A1</h1>

<p>We stand with you.<br/>
On your feet, gladiator. This fight is not over.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>Rest assured, I was not planning to die till I'd avenged the sultana... Still, your words are welcome, lass.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>Know this, Ilberd... There is nothing I would not give to see you pay for what you've done. My wealth, my arm, my life...nothing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>General─are you aware that Lord Lolorito has yet to announce the sultana's death to the public?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>...What? No. No, I was not aware of that─nor of anything else outside my cell. 'Tis passing strange, though... I assumed the bastard would make it known at the first opportunity and set about tearing down the sultanate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>As did we all. And it is indeed strange that he did not─strange or perhaps revealing? Now, I have no conclusive proof, nor do I wish to give you false hope...but I have reason to believe that Her Grace may yet live.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>What? But how can that be?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>Forgive me, friends, but it is not safe here. Let us continue this conversation without.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>My dearest friends! Praise be unto the Twelve for delivering you from the clutches of treachery.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>Father!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>Pipin, my son... And Master Papashan besides...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>Forgive me, Father... I should have been at Her Grace's side...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>(-???-)Save your tears. The sultana yet lives.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>You...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400070</h1>

<p>(-???-)It was I who arranged this gathering.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400080</h1>

<p>And judging by your perplexed expressions, it would seem introductions are in order. I am Dewlala, head of the Order of Nald'thal, and member of the Syndicate.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400090</h1>

<p>What you said about the sultana─is it true? Is she alive?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400100</h1>

<p>Young lady─I understand you were with the sultana when she drank from the poisoned goblet and collapsed. Would I be correct in assuming that you did not personally verify Her Grace's vital signs?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400110</h1>

<p>Why ask, when 'tis plain you know the answer!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400120</h1>

<p>Calm yourself, General, and let me finish. The truth is not as you imagine it. You are all victims of a most ingenious ruse─a ruse conceived to eliminate the threat posed by Teledji Adeledji.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400130</h1>

<p>'Tis my belief that Teledji plotted the sultana's assassination alone, but that Lolorito caught wind of his plot, and exploited it to his own ends.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400140</h1>

<p>He sought to manipulate you into eliminating Teledji for him, and you duly obliged. At one fell swoop, he removed his two foremost rivals, all the while remaining above suspicion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400150</h1>

<p>Gods strike me down for a fool... But the sultana─how can it be that she lives?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400160</h1>

<p>She lives because Lolorito willed it. Her own lady-in-waiting is but one of his many little birds; by her sleight of hand, the poison was switched for a less deadly draft before it could reach her mistress's lips.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400170</h1>

<p>Some manner of sedative, perchance...of a potency sufficient to induce a slumber like unto death.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400180</h1>

<p>Were I to guess, I would say Her Grace is being held somewhere, dreaming dreams of a brighter Ul'dah, even as we speak.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400190</h1>

<p>Oh, Nanamo...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400200</h1>

<p>I will never forgive Lolorito for his part in this.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400210</h1>

<p>Though Lolorito's hands are far from clean, they did pluck Her Grace from the jaws of death. That must count for something.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400220</h1>

<p>And though one may call the man's methods into question, it cannot be denied that he knows the value of stability─to the very gil, like as not. He craves power, 'tis true, but he has no desire to depose the sultana.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400230</h1>

<p>I had never taken sides in your feud with the Monetarists, but it was not for want of concern for our nation's welfare. Indeed, 'twas out of the desire to see order restored that I furnished your Far Eastern friends with information, and arranged this gathering.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400240</h1>

<p>I hope you are ready to work, General, for there is much work to be done. Our first priority must be to bring matters back into balance. Lest you forget Her Grace's words, the true wealth of Ul'dah lies in the health, happiness, and hopes of her people.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400250</h1>

<p>As for the more worldly kind of wealth, I am content to let Lolorito help himself to whatever Teledji Adeledji left behind.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400260</h1>

<p>You, meanwhile, must do that which you alone can do: rescue Her Grace and take your place at her side once more. For her sake...and that of our nation.</p>

[CUTSCENE]

3.0 Heavensward Cutscenes [VoiceMan_03003]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>But what other choice do we have? It's not like we can talk it over with them. Dragons and men aren't exactly on speaking terms.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>...With certain notable exceptions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>You don't mean...Iceheart!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>When last you spoke with her, she lamented her crimes, did she not?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>Then there remains a sliver of hope. If we can persuade Iceheart to act as our intermediary, we may yet be able to convince Nidhogg to abandon his bloody course.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>If there is to be a meeting, I would accompany you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>...Estinien!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>Even with your intermediary, Nidhogg's bloodrage may render him deaf to reason. However, the mere attempt may afford our forces precious time to prepare. </p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>Of course...you might also consider a more direct approach to ending this conflict. With the power of the Eye at my disposal, and the vaunted strength of the Warrior of Light, we could conceivably slay the beast outright...</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>If we are to risk a face-to-face meeting with the dread wyrm, I for one would feel safer in the company of the Azure Dragoon. However, I should only turn to your lance if my words failed to find their mark. Is that clear?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>Perfectly. I shall assume that Iceheart enjoys similar diplomatic protection until instructed otherwise.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>A word of advice: think carefully before divulging the particulars of this plan to Ser Aymeric. 'Twould not do to have the lord commander accused of consorting with heretics.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>Indeed. I thank you for your counsel, Estinien. We shall be honored to have you with us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>I am glad to be of service.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>I want the defenses of the outer ward rechecked. See to it that the ballistas are in good repair and supplied with enough ammunition for a prolonged siege.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>At once, my lord!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>Ah, 'twould seem I have visitors─and unlike those massing beyond our walls, these ones are welcome.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100040</h1>

<p>Pray forgive us for interrupting you in the midst of your preparations, Ser Aymeric, but our suit concerns the impending assault. To speak plain, we believe there is a chance the invasion might be halted before it even begins.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100050</h1>

<p>I can divulge little more at this time, but I must nevertheless request that you advise the Holy See to refrain from launching any preemptive sorties whilst we seek to put our plans in motion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100060</h1>

<p>I will gladly lend my support to any endeavor that could spare the blood of my countrymen─but I would know more of the cause you would have me champion. Will you not share aught of this mysterious undertaking?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100070</h1>

<p>Know that I have offered my lance to aid in this endeavor. I cannot claim that its success is assured, but our actions should serve to delay Nidhogg's advance at the very least.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100080</h1>

<p>Which is more than can be said for the ill-conceived counterattack advocated by the See's more vocal crusaders. They offer glorious death, but little hope of victory.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100090</h1>

<p>Aye...their proposal does not inspire confidence. Our resources should rightly be spent shoring up the city's defenses.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100100</h1>

<p>Hmmm. The Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light, sallying forth together to face the dread wyrm, Nidhogg...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100110</h1>

<p>I must admit, the mere thought of it does much to dispel my misgivings. Go, then─carry out your plan. I shall do what I can for you within the Holy See.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>Such commotion...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>Yes, Your Eminence. The bells of the Observatorium warn of our enemy's approach...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>So...the dragons are coming.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>Let them come─in their hundreds and their thousands. With the divine blade in our hands, we shall rend their flesh and drown the heretics in their masters' blood. Even Nidhogg and his foul brood shall be powerless to resist us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>And when we have rid the world of their pestilence, we shall turn our attention to our Ascian allies─see that they are suitably rewarded for their invaluable assistance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>If I may, Your Eminence. The Paragons wield powers strange and unknowable. Can we be certain that they will not see through our deception?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>We can be certain of naught save the righteousness of our cause. If you would be a true leader of men, you must possess conviction as well as caution.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>We seek to excise the root of an evil that has blighted us for a thousand years. The risk is worth the reward.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200090</h1>

<p>And what of Estinien and this Warrior of Light? They have plans of their own...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200100</h1>

<p>Leave them to their purpose. We must each play the role we have been given...you and your chosen brothers most of all.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200110</h1>

<p>For the glory of King Thordan...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Ah, I should have known it would be you...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Word reached me of a struggle with a small but well-armed band of trespassers. Forgive my comrades their hostility─few come here uninvited, and fewer still with good intent.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Now, tell me why you are here.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q1</h1>

<p>What will you say to Lady Iceheart?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A1</h1>

<p>We wish to stop Nidhogg's attack on Ishgard.<br/>
We wished to speak with you.<br/>
It's a long story...</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)So, you seek to stem the Dravanian tide with talk? A romantic notion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)If you but knew the truth─the spark which lit the flames of this animosity─you would understand the futility of your quest.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Shall I relate it to you? The sordid history my gift has shown me? That which the Holy See has taken such pains to suppress?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)'Twas more than a millennium past when an Elezen tribe first sought to claim the lands of Coerthas as its home.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Unfortunately for them, Coerthas was already home to dragonkind, and they were not inclined to make way for the invaders. Thus did a bloody war begin─a war which might well have rumbled on until one or the other side was exterminated, had it not been for the resolve of a single woman. That woman's name was “Shiva.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)While those around her fought and died, she attempted to parley with the dragons, and in so doing discovered them to be possessed of profound intelligence and reason. The great wyrm Hraesvelgr in particular so enchanted Shiva that she found herself growing to love the creature, whom her people considered a monster.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)In the eyes of a near-immortal dragon, however, the fleeting life of an Elezen is as that of a freshly cut rose─scarce has the flower bloomed before it begins to fade and wither.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Such melancholy musings plagued Hraesvelgr, who had found in Shiva an unexpected and beloved soulmate. He knew that all too soon, death would snatch her away from him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Unable to bear the thought of their separation, the maid bid the wyrm consume her, that their spirits might be entwined for eternity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400070</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)...Though loath to perform the deed, Hraesvelgr ultimately gave in to her plea, and soon thereafter, the tale of their ill-fated love spread throughout the two warring factions. No more could they raise blade or claw against one another, knowing that the souls of their kin were so inextricably bound.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400080</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)In the days that followed, man and dragon learned to live in harmony, and together built a nation unlike any the world had ever known. For two hundred years did this blissful age of peace continue, as it would to this day, had vilest envy not stirred in the hearts of the Elezen.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400090</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)It is said that wyrms owe their longevity to the boundless reserves of vitality found within their eyes─and 'twas in this belief that a traitorous band of knights deceived their allies of some two centuries, and took by force that which they coveted...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Nidhogg─he who now stands poised to unleash his wyrmlings upon Ishgard─was the great dragon who lost an eye to Elezen treachery.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500020</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)And until he prises it from the hands of the traitors' progeny, no amount of conciliatory words will stay his fury.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500030</h1>

<p>You are wrong, Lady Iceheart.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500040</h1>

<p>Lest you misunderstand, I do not doubt your vision of the past─'tis true that Nidhogg greatly desired to reclaim the Eye.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500050</h1>

<p>Indeed, it was for that very reason that I kept it with me as I roamed the land, attempting to draw him away from the city.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500060</h1>

<p>Good gods...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500070</h1>

<p>Until recently, Nidhogg seemed unable to resist its allure, and pursued me relentlessly. Needless to say, that is no longer the case. Now, it would seem he has fixed his attention on Ishgard itself, though he knows full well the Eye does not reside there.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500080</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)You believe he targets the capital for another reason...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500090</h1>

<p>I believe reason has all but left him. Through the Eye, I feel much of what Nidhogg feels, and the dragon's thirst for vengeance will not be quenched by aught less than a sea of blood.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500100</h1>

<p>If Nidhogg is indeed lost to reason, might we not seek an audience with Hraesvelgr instead?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500110</h1>

<p>He has thus far shown no inclination to aid in the invasion of Ishgard, and may yet welcome our efforts to broker a peace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500120</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)You still believe that a peaceable solution can be found? Very well. I will take you to him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500130</h1>

<p>(-Iceheart-)Our road will lead us to Dravania, the homeland of dragonkind. There we shall ascend unto the clouds, where Hraesvelgr resides...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>Is aught amiss, my friend?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>I sense the many battles are beginning to take their toll. Rest awhile. And should you lose sight of us─Dravania lies beyond the mountains to the west.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>Curious... The vestiges of thy mistress's blessing are not as faint as once they were...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600040</h1>

<p>Thy will to succeed grants thee unusual fortitude. But will it be enough...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>Beyond Abalathia's Spine─the great mountain range<br/>
that spans the continent of Aldenard from east to west...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>Into the deepening shadows of Sohm Al,<br/>
where lies the ancient home of dragonkind...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>To a land where the soil slithers, and the skies seethe<br/>
with sinuous shapes, they came.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800010</h1>

<p>Vidofnir!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800020</h1>

<p>Ah, 'tis thee, Little One. From above, I did mistake thee for a Gnath. 'Tis well I chanced to look again, or thou wouldst now be ash.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800030</h1>

<p>Dear Vidofnir...how I have missed you. Would that I had come sooner...and not out of dire necessity.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800040</h1>

<p>Thou art troubled. Speak, that I might know thy plight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800050</h1>

<p>Thou wouldst have Father admonish his brood-brother?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800060</h1>

<p>I would end this war without further bloodshed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800070</h1>

<p>How am I to believe thee, Little One...when thine own companion beareth Nidhogg's stolen eye!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800080</h1>

<p>Have care, dragon...or I shall gouge out one of yours.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800090</h1>

<p>You forget yourself, ser! We are here on a mission of peace!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800100</h1>

<p>My sire's will forbiddeth me from inviting discord to our home... 'Tis for this reason, and no other, that thou still drawest breath, knight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800110</h1>

<p>Vidofnir, please─we must be allowed to convey our intentions to Hraesvelgr in person, with words of our own choosing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800120</h1>

<p>Grant us this favor, and open the way to Sohm Al!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800130</h1>

<p>Thou hast ever been welcome, Little One.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800140</h1>

<p>...But I cannot grant thy wish. I am bound to remain here, and protect my kin from the Gnath's god.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800150</h1>

<p>The Gnath have summoned a primal!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800160</h1>

<p>Pray excuse my forwardness, but if we were to eliminate the threat to your territory, would you consent to Lady Ysayle's request?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800170</h1>

<p>Ha! Dost thou imagine thyself equal to the task─to succeed where dragons have failed?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800180</h1>

<p>'Tis beyond thee, mortal. But thou art welcome to try, nonetheless. Only know that idle promises shall avail thee naught!</p>

<br/>
<h1>800190</h1>

<p>It would seem we have no choice but to make good on Alphinaud's offer. Why must our every bid for peace breed yet more war?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810010</h1>

<p>Now we have but to wait...</p>

<br/>
<h1>810020</h1>

<p>O Lord Ravana! Master of the Sacred Blades! Wrath of the Colony! Conqueror of the World! Hear our prayer!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810030</h1>

<p>Pray grant unto Your devoted children the gift of Your divine presence!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810040</h1>

<p>He comes!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810050</h1>

<p>All strength to the colony. Speak and I shall listen!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810060</h1>

<p>O Glorious General! We have captured intruders, and would make unto You an offering of their life's blood...</p>

<br/>
<h1>810070</h1>

<p>These feeble fleshlings dared to invade Gnath lands?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810080</h1>

<p>Hear me, Lord Ravana! My companion and I did not come to contest your children's territory.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810090</h1>

<p>We wished only to learn the reason you wage war against the dragons.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810100</h1>

<p>Thou wouldst flirt with death merely to satisfy thy curiosity? Wherefore should the glorious conquests of the Gnath concern thee so, Elezen?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810110</h1>

<p>...Ahhh, mayhap thine own kind's struggle against the wyrms fareth poorly, and thou art desirous of a pact.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810120</h1>

<p>We crave no alliance, Lord Ravana─only peace. We would bring an end to our war with the dragons. Yet so long as they remain embroiled in this conflict with your children, our goal shall remain out of reach.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810130</h1>

<p>Never before have the Gnath risen up in such numbers, and never yet with you at their head. Why do you lead them to war?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810140</h1>

<p>Thy question hath no meaning. To live is but to fight.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810150</h1>

<p>Long have my children waited, gathering their strength in the shadow of thy ceaseless conflict.</p>

<h1>810160</h1>

<p>The Gnath would see the Dravanians slain, and their territory secured─and by such fervent prayers am I now given form and purpose.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810170</h1>

<p>As I feared, your very existence is an obstacle to our goal. Since you are so fond of fighting, we challenge you, Lord of the Gnath!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810180</h1>

<p>And should we emerge the victors, I would have you swear to withdraw your soldiers from Dravanian soil!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810190</h1>

<p>Gahahaha! Thou art bold indeed to risk thy fleshy hide so readily!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810200</h1>

<p>Very well. I, Ravana, fourfold master of the blade, do accept thy challenge!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810210</h1>

<p>But should I emerge the victor, I would have thee swear to serve in mine army till thy last breath is spent! Do you accept!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810220</h1>

<p>I do! And I believe the first bout is mine!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810230</h1>

<p>What is this!? A god clad in flesh!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810240</h1>

<p>Is aught amiss, my lord? Thou wilt not break thy word, I trust.</p>

<br/>
<h1>810250</h1>

<p>Mine oath is unbending as steel, little goddess! Thy ruse will but add to mine enjoyment!</p>

<br/>
<h1>810260</h1>

<p>I thought myself...stronger... Mayhap with more crystals...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810270</h1>

<p>Be thou god or maid, thou art nothing to me! ...And what of thee, mortal? Art thou warrior or craven?</p>

<br/>
<h1>810280</h1>

<p>A warrior, then! Good! Mayhap thou wilt provide more sport than thy feeble companion!</p>

<br/>
<h1>820010</h1>

<p>Thus doth the sacred rite of combat proclaim the victor...<br/>
I lay my blades at thy feet, child of man...</p>

<br/>
<h1>820020</h1>

<p>You do not disappoint, Warrior of Light. Would that I had your skill in battle. ...I do begin to see why so many place their faith in you.</p>

<br/>
<h1>820030</h1>

<p>For all his savagery, I do not think Ravana one to break his word. Provided the dragons do not trespass upon Gnath lands, they should have little to fear of the primal's biting blades. We have done well, have we not? Come, let us return to Vidofnir and share these glad tidings.</p>

<br/>
<h1>820040</h1>

<p>Once more you achieve the impossible, Bringer of Light... But with every mortal heart that succumbs to fear and fury, another voice is joined to the chorus beseeching divine succor.</p>

<br/>
<h1>820050</h1>

<p>At their bidding, warring gods will shake the firmament, and your world will be consumed in the swelling storm of chaos...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>To the peak of Sohm Al, at the end of a perilous mountain path...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>Whence could be seen a string of pearl-like islands,<br/>
floating impossibly atop a sea of clouds.</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>To a domain where dragons and men had once lived in harmony, whose majesty<br/>
no mortal eye had glimpsed for nigh on a thousand years, they came.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00010</h1>

<p>Mortals... Why do you disturb my solitude?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00020</h1>

<p>Hraesvelgr...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00030</h1>

<p>Thou speakest the name of a creature that but awaiteth the release of oblivion. Leave me...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00031</h1>

<p>By the Twelve... Mine ears hear the tongue of dragons, yet the meaning rings clear within my mind... How can that be...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00040</h1>

<p>Hraesvelgr...do you not remember me? 'Twas I whom you found in Dravania─I who glimpsed the truth.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00050</h1>

<p>The truth about your past, about Shiva─</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00060</h1>

<p>Do not speak her name, mortal!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00070</h1>

<p>But speak it I must! I have summoned Shiva's soul from the beyond, and offered myself as her vessel! She has made her heart known to me!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00080</h1>

<p>Foolish girl. Thinkest thou my beloved's spirit hath descended from the heavens!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00090</h1>

<p>That the secrets of her heart are thine to know!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00100</h1>

<p>I have surrendered mine to her! Do you not see, my love? I am Shiva reborn!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00110</h1>

<p>Gullible fool... The Light but illuminated the past for thee, it did not grant thee omniscience.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00120</h1>

<p>The spirit thou hast summoned belongeth not to Shiva─'tis but a shade conjured by thine own fancy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00130</h1>

<p>In an age long past, mine own kin were guilty of like folly. Beguiled by the dark ones' lies, they attempted to resurrect a king amongst wyrms─yet the divinity they called forth merely borrowed the semblance of my fallen brood-brother.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00140</h1>

<p>Such gods are not summoned, but created. Phantoms spun from the threads of misplaced faith.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00150</h1>

<p>Then the spirit that answered me...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00160</h1>

<p>...Was but thy dream of Shiva. Thy soul hath been corrupted by a deity of thine own making, child.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00170</h1>

<p>Be that as it may, Lord Hraesvelgr, Ysayle's desire to heal the rift between man and dragon is real, and it has borne us this far.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00180</h1>

<p>We would spare both our kind and yours the ravages of this senseless war! Pray join your voice to ours in a call for peace and forgiveness!</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00190</h1>

<p>The tale of thy kind is one of avarice, treachery, and death─and thou wouldst speak to me of peace?</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00200</h1>

<p>Hark thee, mortal, to the naked truth...then tell me thou deservest forgiveness!</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00010</h1>

<p>Twelve hundred years ago, my beloved Shiva's sacrifice served to bring an end to the war 'twixt man and dragon, paving the way for an age of peace and cooperation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00020</h1>

<p>Two centuries of harmony were to follow, during which time the Elezen learned much about us, not least that the eyes of a great wyrm are the wellspring of his strength.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00030</h1>

<p>'Twas out of the selfish desire to possess this strength that King Thordan then conspired to undo all that our peoples had achieved together.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00040</h1>

<p>With the aid of his leal knights, that most noble of Elezen lured my brood-sister Ratatoskr into an ambush, and took from her that which he craved.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00050</h1>

<p>Fain would I strike the image from my mind, yet still the scene doth linger─of my brood-sister's tattered corpse, defiled by her Elezen allies. They had torn out her eyes, and feasted upon them in the manner of wild beasts.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00060</h1>

<p>Yet that was not all, for from their bloody banquet, the fiends had gained strength beyond that of mortal men... Even now, I labor to comprehend the enormity of their betrayal.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00070</h1>

<p>Nidhogg was the first to learn of the atrocity, and he took to the skies, hungry for vengeance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00080</h1>

<p>But though he slew Thordan and some few of his knights, their fellow butchers knew only too well where to aim their spears, and with now-practiced savagery, they set about my brood-brother, sending him flailing from the field...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00090</h1>

<p>Such is the truth the Holy See would keep hidden. Such was the beginning of the Dragonsong War.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00100</h1>

<p>'Tis a song my kind shall ne'er forget, e'en should ten thousand years pass and Ishgard crumble into dust.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00010</h1>

<p>Your tale bears scant resemblance to the one I was taught. How convenient that it should absolve your kind of all responsibility. But tell me, dragon: why should I believe your version of events?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00020</h1>

<p>What thou choosest to believe is immaterial. The betrayal that yet haunts mine every waking moment is no less than the truth to my kind.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00030</h1>

<p>And Nidhogg meaneth for Thordan's people to suffer for this sin till the end of days.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00040</h1>

<p>That which thou imaginest a war of extinction is but a punishment─a siege of the spirit. Hast thou not seen those who tire of the torment? Those who abandon their own and side with dragonkind?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00050</h1>

<p>Ishgard's so-called heretics...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00060</h1>

<p>Know that all the traitors' progeny bear a trace of Ratatoskr's essence. But a single sip of our blood is enough to awaken it...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00070</h1>

<p>Then...the seed lies within us...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00080</h1>

<p>'Tis for this reason that those who abandon their loyalties are rewarded with a drink. And thus are they transformed, to join the ranks of Nidhogg's ever-growing army as newborn dragons. One by one, through death or defection, my brood-brother shall account for all of the betrayers' children...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00090</h1>

<p>Ye gods... I have borne witness to such a transformation! Looked on as a heretic assumed the shape of a dragon... I imagined it some manner of Dravanian enchantment!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00100</h1>

<p>But if any Ishgardian, regardless of allegiance, has such potential within them... Twelve forgive us. To think of all the dragons we've slain...!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00110</h1>

<p>There will always be some, of course, who choose to fight until the bitter end─like thee, dragoon...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00120</h1>

<p>But struggle as thou might, thy youthful vigor will be spent ere thou reachest two score and ten. And Nidhogg shall remain to torment thine offspring.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00130</h1>

<p>Oft have I wondered why Nidhogg did not simply raze Ishgard to the ground.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00140</h1>

<p>Now I have my answer. He has no intention of winning the Dragonsong War, for it is no war at all, but vengeance─an eternal requiem sung for his murdered sister.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00150</h1>

<p>Thou hast the right of it, dragonslayer. Comprehendest thou now the futility of thy quest?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00160</h1>

<p>I have not come this far only to admit defeat. We can still return the Eye to Nidhogg, and beg forgiveness for our ancestors' crimes. Mayhap our words will sway him!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00170</h1>

<p>Stubborn child... Thou thinkest in mortal terms. Our perception of time is too broad for thee to grasp.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00180</h1>

<p>'Tis a simple matter for thee to offer thine apologies─thou didst not perpetrate the crime. Despite thy visions, the deeds of history seem distant to thee.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00190</h1>

<p>For a wyrm such as Nidhogg, however, that history is yet part of his present, as fresh as the blood that did gush from Ratatoskr's wounds. How could he not be driven mad?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00200</h1>

<p>'Tis only by the calming embrace of Shiva's soul that mine own fury hath not consumed me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00210</h1>

<p>But let us speak no more of what is done. My faith in your kind is spent, and I would be alone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00010</h1>

<p>Well, what do you propose we do now? I, for one, am intent on continuing to the east...</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00020</h1>

<p>What is there to be found in the east?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00030</h1>

<p>Nidhogg's lair─the Aery─is said to lie in that direction. And the Eye tells me he is near...</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00040</h1>

<p>You cannot still mean to slay him!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00050</h1>

<p>You cannot still mean to stop me. I have been true to my word, and aided you in this fool's errand with Hraesvelgr.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00060</h1>

<p>But your efforts at parley have come to naught, Lady Iceheart. I would see Ishgard saved, and for that, Nidhogg must die.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00070</h1>

<p>With the tale of our ancestors' vile betrayal yet ringing in your ears, you speak of continuing this war?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00080</h1>

<p>Nay, lady, I would but pierce its vengeful heart. When Nidhogg dies, this war shall die with him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00090</h1>

<p>A moment, Estinien. You yourself spoke of the great wyrm's strength─that you believed him powerful enough to raze your city to the ground. How then are we few to challenge him?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00100</h1>

<p>Even behind the stout walls of Ishgard─with an army of knights manning the defenses─our victory would be hard-won. Yet you propose to contend with the beast in his own lair?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00110</h1>

<p>In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And if the tales are true, the Warrior of Light has bested many an invincible foe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00120</h1>

<p>In close combat, this will afford us an advantage. And with two Azure Dragoons working in unison, who can say what might be possible?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00130</h1>

<p>But such speculation is meaningless if we cannot even find the wyrm. Our first task must be to seek out Nidhogg's lair.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00140</h1>

<p>The story of this nation grows bloodier by the moment. Must death always be answered with more of the same?</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00150</h1>

<p>Such is the way of things, I fear. I shall consider it a miracle if mine armor is not stained crimson ere this conflict is ended.</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00160</h1>

<p>That I should be blinded by my own lies... Everything I believed... Everything I thought I was... Gone... All gone...</p>

<br/>
<h1>D00170</h1>

<p>Leave her. Your words will not reach her now. And we have not the time to wait for her to gather up the pieces of her shattered faith.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00010</h1>

<p>Is that it?</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00020</h1>

<p>Aye... That would be the Aery. I feel Nidhogg's presence through the Eye─his caustic hatred gnawing at my soul.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00030</h1>

<p>'Twould seem the death of his consort has put him on guard. Mark how he wards his lair with tempestuous winds.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00040</h1>

<p>A similar barrier once barred our entrance to the primal Garuda's domain...until we discovered the means by which it could be penetrated.</p>

<br/>
<h1>E00050</h1>

<p>Mayhap it is time we called upon Master Garlond. 'Twill be just like the good old days, no?</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00010</h1>

<p>Feast your eyes upon our latest and greatest feat of engineering! We call it a “manacutter”!</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00020</h1>

<p>After you put down Gaius, Wedge and me struck out on our own for a bit, and started work on the successor to the Tiny Bronco.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00030</h1>

<p>Impressive little thing, isn't she? My talent for ship design has plainly rubbed off on them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00040</h1>

<p>They've adapted the principles of corrupted crystal technology, and constructed a mechanism which converts aether from its surroundings into elemental wind. Said wind is then harnessed by the specially engineered sails, providing the craft with propulsion and lift. All in all, a most elegant solution...</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00050</h1>

<p>...I'm actually a little upset that I didn't think of it myself.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00060</h1>

<p>The design does, however, come with one small flaw...</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00070</h1>

<p>The energy conversion ratio's bloody awful. To generate enough power to get you off the ground, you need to be in an area awash with predominantly wind-aspected aether.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00080</h1>

<p>In other words, there are a few places you can fly...and lots of places you can't.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00090</h1>

<p>The new Ishgardian airship hasn't left the boys much time for tinkering─meaning it may be a while before this particular project takes off, if you'll forgive the pun.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00100</h1>

<p>Hah...hah...hah...</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00110</h1>

<p>Tataru, what's happened!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00120</h1>

<p>I've been looking all over for you! There's been word from Ul'dah! It's about Her Grace, the sultana!</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00130</h1>

<p>It seems you're required elsewhere. Leave the manacutter with us. We'll see that she's airworthy and suitably equipped to slice through those winds.</p>

<br/>
<h1>F00140</h1>

<p>You, meanwhile, should concentrate on providing Raubahn and the sultana whatever help they need!</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00010</h1>

<p>Thank you for coming.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00020</h1>

<p>No thanks are necessary, General. I trust your recuperation continues apace?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00030</h1>

<p>I cannot complain. Thanks to Higiri and her ministrations, I've regained much of the strength I lost during my imprisonment.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00040</h1>

<p>I gather you have made progress in the search for Her Grace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00050</h1>

<p>Aye, some good fortune at last. A few days past, Dewlala informed us that a sizable shipment of alchemical supplies had been delivered to the palace.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00060</h1>

<p>With Papashan's assistance, I set out to ascertain the source and nature of the shipment. My inquiries led me to Frondale's Phrontistery.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00070</h1>

<p>There I learned that an order had been placed for a curious substance designed to sustain patients trapped in deathlike slumber─an invention of the former head alchemist, apparently.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00080</h1>

<p>A deathlike slumber...? This cannot be a coincidence!</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00090</h1>

<p>It lends some weight to Dewlala's claims, aye. Her Grace is likely somewhere within the palace─abed but alive.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00100</h1>

<p>Before making any attempt to extricate the sultana, however, it seemed prudent to learn what manner of substance was used to induce her torpor. To that end, I made inquiries as to the whereabouts of the one most like to have administered it─the lady-in-waiting, Meriel.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00110</h1>

<p>We sent for you as soon as we learned of her location. All that remains is to apprehend the woman.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00120</h1>

<p>We shall find our cat's-paw in the Silver Bazaar.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00130</h1>

<p>But we must tread carefully. The market is not the bustling place it once was, and someone is sure to mark our coming. Should they inform the Monetarists, we'll have a fight on our hands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00140</h1>

<p>We must be prepared for the worst─and being short an arm, I thought it wise to take another in its stead. What say you, Warrior of Light? Will you lend me yours?</p>

<br/>
<h1>G00150</h1>

<p>Then I pity the bastard that stands in our way. Come, my friends! For Nanamo...and for Ul'dah!</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00010</h1>

<p>You are Meriel, the sultana's former lady-in-waiting?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00020</h1>

<p>I know no one of that name! Pray excuse me...</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00030</h1>

<p>General Aldynn!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00040</h1>

<p>We will have the truth from you, girl...</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00050</h1>

<p>Mayhap 'twould be better coming from me.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00060</h1>

<p>Lolorito... You'd best talk fast.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00070</h1>

<p>As you know, Teledji Adeledji's Carteneau Reclamation Bill was no more than a facade─a means to get his grubby little hands on that Allagan monstrosity, Omega.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00080</h1>

<p>When he learned of Nanamo's intention to abdicate, however, he was forced to amend his plans. Suddenly, assassination seemed the most promising way to further his ambitions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00090</h1>

<p>I am told Teledji had discovered a maid in whose veins ran the blood of House Thorne─a new, more pliable puppet to sit the throne. 'Twould have caused an uproar, of course, but few could have contested her claim.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00100</h1>

<p>'Twas plain that Teledji's wild machinations had outgrown our ability to control them. So I decided to usurp his scheme, and left the fool to seal his own demise.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00110</h1>

<p>And what of Nanamo?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00120</h1>

<p>Oh, I have no desire to harm Her Grace─'twould profit me little to destabilize our government. Thus did I employ young Meriel here to administer a potent sleeping potion in place of a poison.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00130</h1>

<p>You should know, General, that your dear friend Ilberd was fully aware of my plan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00140</h1>

<p>I had him lie about the assassination as a means to prime your rage against Teledji. We weren't entirely sure how you would react, but things went rather better than expected.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00150</h1>

<p>You conniving little worm... You had your claws in the Crystal Braves before their first recruit had sworn to serve!</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00160</h1>

<p>But of course. When a new game begins, 'tis only prudent to have a piece on the board. Ilberd was mine.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00170</h1>

<p>Truth be told, a significant proportion of the Braves' initial endowment was also mine. With such large sums moving about, 'twas a rather trifling matter to disguise my own contribution.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00180</h1>

<p>Ah, Ilberd... I secured his services with a promise to support his cause once my authority had been solidified. I swear, the man thinks of naught but prising Ala Mhigo from the grasp of the Empire.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00190</h1>

<p>Unlike you, General, the poor fellow seems quite unable to forsake the land of his forefathers. Mayhap that's why he called you a traitor to your people and a disgrace to your homeland...amongst other things. What was it he always compared you to? Oh, yes! “An overgrown lapdog, begging for scraps at the sultana's table!” Oh, how we laughed...</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00200</h1>

<p>Alas, Ilberd's entertaining little outbursts eventually gave way to wearisome tirades, and the zealous brute became rather unruly. I had no wish to see you executed, you understand, but he would not take no for an answer. Rest assured, his employment with me has long since ended.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00210</h1>

<p>...Which brings us neatly to the present. What say you, General? Both you and the sultana are alive; we have one corpse and one fugitive; and preparations have been made to restore your good name. Shall we cry quits and start again with a blank ledger? Hm?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00220</h1>

<p>The hells we will! Do you honestly expect me to forgive and forget? After all you've done!? You're guilty of high treason!</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00230</h1>

<p>Stay your blade, Master Aldynn! You yourself are not innocent! Or have you forgotten your own crime in executing Teledji Adeledji without trial!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00240</h1>

<p>Though you acted out of loyalty to the sultana, such deeds are in violation of both the word and spirit of the law!</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00250</h1>

<p>...If you would, Lord Lolorito?</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00260</h1>

<p>This potion will wake the sultana from her slumber. Consider it a gesture of conciliation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00270</h1>

<p>You will find Her Grace resting comfortably within her private chambers. Should you doubt my word, I shall willingly accompany you to the palace as your hostage.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00280</h1>

<p>I like not your motives, Lolorito...but you saved the sultana's life, and for that you have my gratitude.</p>

<br/>
<h1>H00290</h1>

<p>Raubahn Aldynn, you are hereby reinstated as general of the Immortal Flames! The citizens of Ul'dah shall once more be united under Nanamo Ul Namo, and together we shall usher in a new age of prosperity!</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00010</h1>

<p>Ugh...</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00020</h1>

<p>I was having the longest dream...</p>

<br/>
<h1>I00030</h1>

<p>'Tis time to wake up, Your Grace. Another day begins in Thanalan, and the sun blazes bright upon the sands.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00010</h1>

<p>Her Grace is awoken. The palace physician assures me she is none the worse for her slumber.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00020</h1>

<p>I believe Her Grace will soon resume her plans to place the government of Ul'dah into the hands of its citizens.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00030</h1>

<p>Whatever path she chooses to take, I shall walk it with her. And we shall tread slowly, lest the nation be unsettled in our wake.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00040</h1>

<p>Her Grace's compassion is a shining beacon to us all...but what our city truly thrives upon is competition.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00050</h1>

<p>'Tis in the struggle against our rivals that opportunities are seized and fortunes made. And with the Empire on the offensive once more, now would hardly seem the time to turn our system of government upon its head.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00060</h1>

<p>Are you privy to new intelligence, my lord?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00070</h1>

<p>I would hardly call it new. Remind me: what was the name of that enormous imperial warship which met its end in Mor Dhona? Wait, I have it! The Agrius. Yes, well, 'twould appear that the Garleans have been hard at work on another such vessel.</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00080</h1>

<p>How close are they to completing this ship!? Is it operational!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>J00090</h1>

<p>Its maiden flight was a success, I hear. I should imagine Emperor Varis is eager to see how it performs in battle.</p>

<h1>J00100</h1>

<p>My lords and ladies, I move that it is time to repair the damage caused by Teledji Adeledji, and prepare our great nation to repel the Empire once more.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00010</h1>

<p>'Tis well that the sultana has awoken. The Syndicate yet needs to put its house in order, but 'twould seem the worst of the confusion has passed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00020</h1>

<p>Ul'dah has taken control of its future...and I must do the same.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00030</h1>

<p>I have decided to disband the Crystal Braves.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00040</h1>

<p>Among the recruits, there were those who supported our order's goals and convictions with all sincerity. 'Tis my hope that these loyal men and women will choose to remain our allies in the battles to come.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00050</h1>

<p>As for those who sided with the traitor, Ilberd, they shall be hunted down and held to account for their crimes. It is my earnest hope that they will surrender themselves peaceably when the time comes...though I think it unlikely.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00060</h1>

<p>Ah, my all-conquering Crystal Braves... The model army meant to pave the way for a single, unified Grand Company of Eorzea. That so high an ideal should be brought so low...</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00070</h1>

<p>I need not tell you how deeply the betrayal stung me. Yet I see now that it was mine own naivety and pride which allowed the Braves to fall prey to corruption.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00080</h1>

<p>As ever, it is to your own shining example that I turn for inspiration. Like you, I mean to stand firm in the face of hardship, and give mine all for the cause.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00090</h1>

<p>Let us resume the search for our missing comrades, that we might come together to shine the light of dawn across the realm once more.</p>

<br/>
<h1>K00100</h1>

<p>The role of Crystal Brave commander suited me ill, and I shall play it no longer. Henceforth, I shall be no more or less than Alphinaud, proud member of the Scions.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00010</h1>

<p>All stands ready, Lord Commander.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00020</h1>

<p>Ah, the moment has come, then?</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00030</h1>

<p>Pray excuse my lateness. I paid a brief visit to the workshop to inquire about the manacutters. The engineers assure me that they are ready.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00040</h1>

<p>The Aery is now but a short flight away. Yet what a long and winding path we took to reach this point.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00050</h1>

<p>Were it not for Master Alphinaud's proposal, we never would have attempted to parley with the dragons.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00060</h1>

<p>Though our negotiations yielded little, our expedition with Lady Iceheart taught us much.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00070</h1>

<p>You took an unimaginable risk... I could scarce believe the tale Estinien told.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00080</h1>

<p>Aye, 'tis true that many of our countrymen would sooner die than join hands with the heretics' mistress, but 'twas through that most unlikely of alliances that we came to speak with Hraesvelgr.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00090</h1>

<p>A conversation that went rather poorly, as I recall.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00100</h1>

<p>In this instance, the journey was more important than the destination. Had we not slain Nidhogg's consort, Tioman, and put the great wyrm on his guard, the Dravanians would have arrived at Ishgard's walls long ago.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00110</h1>

<p>Aye, that they would. Full grateful am I for every hour of respite your actions have afforded us. Thanks to you, our defenses are much improved. 'Tis but a pity they won't be enough.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00120</h1>

<p>Thus you believe an assault upon the Aery represents the city's best chance of survival. Is that not so, Estinien?</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00130</h1>

<p>I am under no illusions. Nidhogg's might is legendary. But with his eye in my possession, I can stifle his strength at the source.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00140</h1>

<p>Victory will be hard-won, even so, and I shall be glad indeed to have the Warrior of Light at my side.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00150</h1>

<p>You shall have my blade as well. There are more of these “manacutters” to be had, yes?</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00160</h1>

<p>(-Lucia-)Lord Commander, no!</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00170</h1>

<p>How can I, a proud knight of Ishgard, stand by and do naught while an outsider risks life and limb for our homeland? I swore an oath to protect this city!</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00180</h1>

<p>Pray leave the slaying of dragons to dragoons, ser knight. Your duty to command the city's defense is no less vital.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00190</h1>

<p>Should we fail, and Nidhogg slip through our grasp, who, then, will hold the walls against him? Will you leave Ishgard in the hands of the Holy See's zealots?</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00200</h1>

<p>There are others─</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00210</h1>

<p>Who but you has the authority and the standing to orchestrate a citywide defense? I do not, and neither does the Warrior of Light. That is why it is our place to fight, and yours to remain here, Lord Commander.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00220</h1>

<p>What, you too, Master Alphinaud? By the Fury... You have shown some promise, but this adversary is far beyond your skills.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00230</h1>

<p>Your candor is appreciated, ser dragoon. I shall remain, then, and cheer you from afar.</p>

<br/>
<h1>L00240</h1>

<p>Well, my friend, 'twould seem I have discouraged the last of the volunteers, and claimed the task as ours alone. But if any alive can best this wyrm, 'tis surely we two!</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00010</h1>

<p>We're through!</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00020</h1>

<p>So, this is the Aery! Where are you Nidhogg!? You have guests!</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00030</h1>

<p>There!</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00040</h1>

<p>Greetings, Lord of Dravania! I believe we have something that belongs to you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>M00050</h1>

<p>Wicked mortals! I shall melt your flesh, and turn your bones to ash!</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00010</h1>

<p>Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me!? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity!</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00020</h1>

<p>I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again!</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00030</h1>

<p>No, wyrm! This ends here!</p>

<br/>
<h1>N00040</h1>

<p>You gifted my people a thousand years of suffering. Now I gift you an eternity in darkness!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00010</h1>

<p>They are ours, Lord Haldrath... The eyes of Nidhogg!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00020</h1>

<p>Aye... The wyrm lies broken and my father is avenged. With the wellspring of his vitality thus denied him, Nidhogg shall not linger long in this world.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00030</h1>

<p>But behold the terrible price we have paid. My sire is dead; so many brother knights slain.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00040</h1>

<p>We traded our honor for the strength which now courses in our veins. And still we are forced to make such sacrifice.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00050</h1>

<p>But not in vain, my lord. Hraesvelgr is the only great wyrm left in Dravania, and he dares not leave his lair.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00060</h1>

<p>With Nidhogg's eyes in your possession, who now can challenge the might of Ishgard? Ascend the throne, and take your rightful place as the ruler of our people!</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00070</h1>

<p>Nay, my friend, I must forsake the mantle of king. Though Nidhogg be defeated, his wyrmling horde yet darkens the skies with wings beyond counting.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00080</h1>

<p>As one who partook of Ratatoskr's strength, it shall be my penance to bear a knight's arms until death grants me leave to retire. When that day comes, no prince shall perish, but a hells-bound hunter of dragons...</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00090</h1>

<p>But Lord Haldrath! What then shall become of the royal line!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00100</h1>

<p>Think of your people, my lord! Without a king, who will the common man turn to in his hour of need? How will he find his way without your benevolent hand to guide him?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00110</h1>

<p>I thank you, Ser Flavien and Ser Sylvetrel─for dispelling my remaining doubts. With men of such wisdom and compassion in service to the realm, 'tis plain that Ishgard has no need of a king.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00120</h1>

<p>But if you must bow to the demands of tradition, you need look no further than yourselves for one worthy to wear the crown.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00130</h1>

<p>Fare thee well, my brother knights...my loyal friends. On these shoulders shall I bear the weight of my father's sins; with this lance shall I repay the debt accrued through our misdeeds.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00140</h1>

<p>What cruel jest has fate played upon us...? Have we seized this desperate victory only to lose a king?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00150</h1>

<p>We can but act as our lord has bid. We few who remain must divide between us the rulership of Ishgard and her people.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00160</h1>

<p>Not I. My oath was to Lord Haldrath, and he alone. If he is not to be king, then I would hang up my shield, as well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00170</h1>

<p>Will you abandon us, too, ser?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00180</h1>

<p>I would wash my hands of blood and betrayal and take up an honest trade. Mayhap I shall serve ale instead of sharpened steel...</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00190</h1>

<p>We four, then...</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00200</h1>

<p>Fortemps, Haillenarte, Durendaire, and Dzemael...</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00210</h1>

<p>But four houses to rule all of Ishgard...</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00220</h1>

<p>...And what of the throne?</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00230</h1>

<p>We keep it empty. Until the day a king rises once more, we must assume the role of stewards.</p>

<br/>
<h1>O00240</h1>

<p>We shall shape our nation anew with a history of our own making─and let the truth of this dark day die here, upon the battlefield.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00010</h1>

<p>What ails you, friend!? Are you wounded?</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00020</h1>

<p>You have borne witness to history...to the culmination of the first battle with Nidhogg.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00030</h1>

<p>The legend of Ishgard's founding tells that our ancestors were led to the land of Coerthas by the valiant King Thordan.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00040</h1>

<p>In the midst of their journey, they came to a wide chasm, where they were set upon by a great wyrm─Nidhogg. A furious battle then ensued, with Thordan leading the van.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00050</h1>

<p>Though the brave king was slain defending his people, his son, Haldrath, the first Azure Dragoon, fought on undaunted...</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00060</h1>

<p>And with a mighty thrust of his lance, he gouged out Nidhogg's eye, forcing the wicked creature into retreat.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00070</h1>

<p>Thus did this eldritch orb become a sacred treasure of Ishgard, lending its power to every knight deemed worthy to bear the title of Azure Dragoon.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00080</h1>

<p>A rousing tale, is it not? Would that I could still believe it. But your vision, which we must accept as immutable truth, leaves no room for doubt─save on one point.</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00090</h1>

<p>If Haldrath took both of Nidhogg's eyes, then how came this eye to be lodged in the wyrm's skull?</p>

<br/>
<h1>P00100</h1>

<p>Beneath every answer we unearth, another question lies buried...</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00010</h1>

<p>'Twas a fierce battle, but one I knew we would win. Your fame is well deserved, Warrior of Light. Full proud am I to have fought at your side.</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00020</h1>

<p>I would fain return with all swiftness to Ishgard to inform the lord commander of our triumph...</p>

<br/>
<h1>Q00030</h1>

<p>But we must first have words with Hraesvelgr. There are parts of this tale that the wyrm has kept from us, and I would know wherefore...</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00010</h1>

<p>Impenitent mortals, ever seeking to bury old wrongs under new.</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00020</h1>

<p>I did sense the moment of Nidhogg's demise...</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00030</h1>

<p>You mean the moment I prised your eye from his head?</p>

<br/>
<h1>R00040</h1>

<p>'Twould seem thou hast uncovered my secret. Aye. Unto the blinded Nidhogg did I yield one half of my strength...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00010</h1>

<p>Nidhogg... What hath befallen thee?</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00020</h1>

<p>We are undone by covetous mortals. They did take Ratatoskr's eyes...and glut their appetites upon her essence...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00030</h1>

<p>She is slain, then? What madness hath unmade our peaceful accord!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00040</h1>

<p>Did I not warn thee, brood-brother? They have ever been untrustworthy creatures, these short-lived Elezen.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00050</h1>

<p>But thou wert enchanted by thy mortal maid. Thy folly hath cost Ratatoskr her life, and me mine eyes...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00060</h1>

<p>Oh, my beloved Shiva... How swiftly are thy kin made bestial by their appetites.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00070</h1>

<p>Hraesvelgr. 'Twas thy blindness that did invite disaster into our lands. Surrender thee an eye to me, and let that be thy penance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00080</h1>

<p>Nidhogg...</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00090</h1>

<p>They bested me once, but I was reckless. I shall need but a single eye to inflict enduring torment upon these traitors and every child of their line!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00100</h1>

<p>Yield to me thy strength, brood-brother!</p>

<br/>
<h1>S00110</h1>

<p>My vengeance is begun!</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00010</h1>

<p>Thou hast borne witness to a scene from my past.</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00020</h1>

<p>It was yours... Your strength that sustained Nidhogg all these years...</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00030</h1>

<p>Would that Haldrath had dealt the wyrm a killing blow...</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00040</h1>

<p>When my brood-brother did appear before me, bloody and blinded, his life was all but spent. He demanded half my vigor, that he might exact his revenge upon the mortals who had wronged us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00050</h1>

<p>And so you acquiesced! You surrendered your eye to Nidhogg knowing full well the suffering he would inflict!</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00060</h1>

<p>The peace my beloved so dearly desired had been shattered by her own kin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00070</h1>

<p>Their treachery claimed my brood-sister's life and my brood-brother's reason! Thinkest thou thy fits of indignation will move me to remorse!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00080</h1>

<p>Go, mortals! Take your unruly passions and leave this place... Your presence here spelleth naught but misery.</p>

<br/>
<h1>T00090</h1>

<p>Were it not for Shiva's soothing embrace, I would slay you where you stand. Woe betide you should the bond we share ever weaken!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00010</h1>

<p>'Twas my life's goal to slay Nidhogg, but I find there is little joy to be had in its accomplishment.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00020</h1>

<p>But you have rid the world of a hate-filled creature, and ended a bloody war in so doing...</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00030</h1>

<p>I lost my family to Nidhogg's flames. And 'twas with fury in my heart that I took up the lance. Every blow I struck, I struck in the name of vengeance. We were not so different, he and I.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00040</h1>

<p>I will not judge you for your deeds─I have not the right. Too many innocents have perished in the name of my “greater good.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00050</h1>

<p>Yet even with all that has passed, the tale is incomplete.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00060</h1>

<p>We are short a great wyrm's eye. Of the pair which Haldrath took from Nidhogg, only one is known to us─the one I bear. What, then, became of the other?</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00070</h1>

<p>Why did Nidhogg, who had taken such pains to prolong the Dragonsong War, suddenly decide to hurl his entire army against the walls of Ishgard?</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00080</h1>

<p>Lord Commander... Aye, the deed is done. Nidhogg is slain.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00090</h1>

<p>What? ...In the city!? A battle with whom!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00100</h1>

<p>At once, Lord Commander. Hold firm till our return.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00110</h1>

<p>Fighting has broken out in the city. Lord Aymeric was sparse with the particulars, but it seems some commoners threw open the gates to a force of heretics.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00120</h1>

<p>I gave no order to attack!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00130</h1>

<p>Are we to mark the end of the Dragonsong War by spilling the blood of our own? Mayhap Hraesvelgr was right about us...</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00140</h1>

<p>Let us away, Warrior of Light. The people must be saved from themselves.</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00150</h1>

<p>Wait! I would join you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00160</h1>

<p>There has been enough violence. I will appeal to my people in the city and make them see reason!</p>

<br/>
<h1>U00170</h1>

<p>Come, then, Lady Iceheart. Let us write the final chapter in this damnable war.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00010</h1>

<p>A small army of heretics has invaded the city, Your Eminence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00020</h1>

<p>But there is no cause for concern. A sizable contingent of our soldiers is already in place to repel the Dravanian assault, and the intruders will soon find themselves outnumbered and outmatched.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00030</h1>

<p>Our plans proceed apace, then.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00040</h1>

<p>Yes, Your Eminence. This unrest shall serve to feed the people's fear of the heretics and the dragons both.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00050</h1>

<p>And lend renewed fervor to their prayers for deliverance...</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00060</h1>

<p>Very good. Grant our guests what time they need to sow a measure of chaos, then order the Temple Knights to crush them.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00070</h1>

<p>Your will be done.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00080</h1>

<p>The moment is at hand?</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00090</h1>

<p>Excellent. All shall soon be in alignment.</p>

<br/>
<h1>V00100</h1>

<p>It is time for the Bringer of Light to die.</p>

3.0 Heavensward Cutscenes [VoiceMan_03004]

<h1>000020</h1>

<p>Comrades! Sheathe your swords! There is no need for further bloodshed!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000030</h1>

<p>My lady!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000040</h1>

<p>She is come!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000050</h1>

<p>Hear me, brothers and sisters! The war is ended! Nidhogg is no more!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000060</h1>

<p>Aye, it is so! This adventurer and the Azure Dragoon laid the great wyrm low!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000070</h1>

<p>The endless cycle of violence between man and dragon was born of our forefathers' treachery.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000080</h1>

<p>You have followed me─bled with me─to bring this truth to light, that we might all know peace!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000090</h1>

<p>But Nidhogg is dead─Nidhogg is dead, my friends! He who bore such hatred towards Ishgard is dead!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000100</h1>

<p>Let his hatred die with him, I say! Let us sheathe our swords and go in peace!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000110</h1>

<p>Have we lost!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000120</h1>

<p>No, my friend, far from it! At long last, the peace for which we have so desperately fought is within our grasp! And I for one would not forsake it!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000130</h1>

<p>Peace...?</p>

<br/>
<h1>000140</h1>

<p>Seize the witch! Let none escape!</p>

<br/>
<h1>000150</h1>

<p>Providing aid and succor to the wounded should be our first concern.</p>

<br/>
<h1>000160</h1>

<p>If the heretics mean to observe the peace, then it would be folly not to do the same!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100010</h1>

<p>Praise Halone, you are safe!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100020</h1>

<p>My safety was never in doubt, Father, for I had the Azure Dragoon and the Warrior of Light by my side.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100030</h1>

<p>We bring the most wonderful tidings!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100040</h1>

<p>The infamous Lady Iceheart, here in Ishgard? This is most unexpected...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100050</h1>

<p>She has done much to quell the violence. The inquisition may not approve, but we are glad of her presence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100060</h1>

<p>And with the great wyrm's demise, even our nation's more reactionary elements will have scant grounds to press for her immediate impeachment.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100070</h1>

<p>My thoughts exactly.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100080</h1>

<p>What of the truth revealed to us by Hraesvelgr? That the origins of the Dragonsong War─a core tenet of Ishgardian faith─are quite unlike those depicted in the scriptures.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100090</h1>

<p>...That men and dragons once lived together in harmony, and that it was man's treachery which shattered the peace and plunged our peoples into war.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100100</h1>

<p>The same scripture also describes the origins of the High Houses. Were it exposed as false, the legitimacy of our rule would be called into question.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100110</h1>

<p>If both highborn and lowborn can trace their ancestry to Thordan and his knights twelve...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100120</h1>

<p>But a single sip of dragon's blood is required to confirm their lineage.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100130</h1>

<p>If the Holy See knew of this and chose to remain silent, their crimes are grievous indeed. Regardless, this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100140</h1>

<p>Ser Aymeric! You cannot mean to raise this matter with the archbishop!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100150</h1>

<p>Pray consider what you are proposing! If the Holy See chose to conceal the truth for centuries, what reason would they have to reveal it now!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>100160</h1>

<p>At best, you will be branded a heretic and clapped in irons!</p>

<br/>
<h1>100170</h1>

<p>Then, at least, the archbishop will have shown his true colors. My friends, this war will never truly be at an end until the truth is made known.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100180</h1>

<p>You must see what lies on the horizon if it is not. When ruled by fear of a common enemy, we were united.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100190</h1>

<p>But now we have none. During the war, the highborn needed men to lead, and the lowborn, men to follow. Not anymore. 'Tis but a matter of time before the old order is called into question.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100200</h1>

<p>Lady Iceheart will share the truth with her followers, and the Holy See will be powerless to stop its spread. The disenfranchised will rise up, united, and blood will flow in the streets once more...</p>

<br/>
<h1>100210</h1>

<p>A divided Ishgard will not survive.</p>

<br/>
<h1>100220</h1>

<p>Tread carefully, Lord Commander...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200010</h1>

<p>My lady, is it wise to let him go?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200020</h1>

<p>I sympathize with the lord commander's desire for reform, but to approach the archbishop in this manner bespeaks an idealism to which I did not think Ser Aymeric prone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200030</h1>

<p>Though he comports himself as a realist, he has long dreamt of reform. 'Twas that idealism which first drew me to him─that which made me swear an oath to serve.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200040</h1>

<p>We must not think of ways to hinder his cause, but rather ways to aid it─even should the Holy See cry heresy.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200050</h1>

<p>You cannot mean...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200060</h1>

<p>If the lord commander does not return from the Vault at the appointed hour, I mean to go and fetch him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200070</h1>

<p>Have care, my lady─your words border on treason! Should they reach the wrong ears, you would be declared an enemy of Ishgard!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200080</h1>

<p>That is a risk I am willing to take. Lest you forget, my lord─I am not born of this land. My loyalty is to the lord commander alone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200090</h1>

<p>But I speak only of what may come to pass. If the rumors regarding his heritage are to be believed, we have naught to fear.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200100</h1>

<p>Hmph. Lies and slander.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200110</h1>

<p>Forgive me─what rumors are these?</p>

<p>That Ser Aymeric is the archbishop's bastard son.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200130</h1>

<p>Senior clergy are not permitted to marry and sire children. But even the holiest among us are not immune to temptation.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200140</h1>

<p>I labor to believe it... Ser Aymeric is truly the archbishop's son?</p>

<br/>
<h1>200150</h1>

<p>He has never been publicly acknowledged as such, but the rumors have plagued him since childhood.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200160</h1>

<p>That he rose to his current position, despite being despised as a bastard, and accused of profiting from his father's influence, bespeaks the quality of his character.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200170</h1>

<p>It is my hope that on this occasion, the burden of his birth will work in his favor. Should our worst fears be realized, the archbishop will not be so quick to execute his own flesh and blood, affording us time to mount a rescue.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200180</h1>

<p>Bastard or trueborn, he is our nation's best hope. If the Holy See dares to threaten him, I shall lead the charge against the Vault myself.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200190</h1>

<p>Hear, hear! The future of Ishgard rests on Ser Aymeric's shoulders! I too will do mine utmost to aid his cause!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200200</h1>

<p>Haurchefant, be reasonable...</p>

<br/>
<h1>200210</h1>

<p>A knight lives to serve, Father─to aid those in need! The people need Ser Aymeric─more than ever─and we may be his only hope!</p>

<br/>
<h1>200220</h1>

<p>There is no greater calling for a knight than to save the life of his fellow man. I swear to you, on the sigil of our house, that I shall do this and make you proud.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200230</h1>

<p>Even you? <sigh> Romantic, reckless fools, the lot of you. So be it─make your preparations.</p>

<br/>
<h1>200240</h1>

<p>I thank you all for your support.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300010</h1>

<p>Where d'you think you're goin', missy?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300020</h1>

<p>I-I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300030</h1>

<p>What's going on here!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300040</h1>

<p>What's it to you, boy!? Piss off!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300050</h1>

<p>Hold on! I've seen them around. They're in and out of House Fortemps's manor all the time.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300060</h1>

<p>Ohhh, I see. Skulkin' about at your highborn masters' biddin', eh? Bloodhounds hopin' to catch a whiff of heresy, is that it?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300070</h1>

<p>You are quite mistaken, I assure you. We came here to help. And if you know what's good for you, you will let us pass!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300080</h1>

<p>Haha! Listen to the pup's yappin'! Come here, boy─I'll give you cause to yelp!</p>

<br/>
<h1>300090</h1>

<p>(-???-)Enough! Leave threatenin' women and children to our “betters”! We don't have the knack! </p>

<br/>
<h1>300100</h1>

<p>Hilda!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>300110</h1>

<p>Lay a finger on the blue bloods' pups and you're like to lose the hand.</p>

<br/>
<h1>300120</h1>

<p>It ain't often I get called on by glorious heroes like yourself. So tell me: what have I done to deserve you?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400010</h1>

<p>...So while you were on your way to kill Nidhogg, you stumbled on some dirty secrets that the Holy See has been hidin' for centuries.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400020</h1>

<p>Eh? What are they on about?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400030</h1>

<p>The High Houses, and what makes a nobleman so bleedin' noble. They trace their blood back to King Thordan and his knights twelve─the founders of Ishgard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400040</h1>

<p>But our friends here reckon we're all descended from the heroes of eld─highborn and lowborn alike.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400050</h1>

<p>And so Ser Aymeric, lord commander of the Temple Knights, has gone to ask the archbishop if he wouldn't mind lettin' everyone know.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400060</h1>

<p>Is he simple!? The old bastard'll have him executed for heresy!</p>

<br/>
<h1>400070</h1>

<p>Well, seems to me that's what the good ser wants. Seems he thinks a noble sacrifice will serve to prove his claims.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400080</h1>

<p>We cannot stand idly by and allow Ser Aymeric to do this. Ishgard has need of him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400090</h1>

<p>Look, you've a good heart. I can see that. Willin' to risk your neck for someone else, even when his troubles ain't yours. But what's this got to do with me?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400100</h1>

<p>If Ser Aymeric is imprisoned in the Vault, we will need all the help we can muster to breach their defenses and rescue him.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400110</h1>

<p>What in the hells─!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400120</h1>

<p><sniff> Ahhh, the unmistakable scent of heresy...</p>

<br/>
<h1>400130</h1>

<p>And what do we have here? The honored guests of House Fortemps consorting with the queen of rats?</p>

<br/>
<h1>400140</h1>

<p>Oooh. Plotting insurrection I shouldn't wonder! Tsk-tsk. That won't do.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400150</h1>

<p>Sickness is wont to fester and spread. It must be burned out ere the infection takes hold.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400160</h1>

<p>I reckon ser'd be happy to wield the irons himself. Well, so happens I've got irons of my own.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400170</h1>

<p>Ahahaha! Such simple creatures, rats. Certain to attack when cornered.</p>

<br/>
<h1>400180</h1>

<p>Let us step outside, milady. In here, your toys could hurt someone.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500010</h1>

<p>There's no denying your gifts... A well-deserved reputation indeed.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500020</h1>

<p>Enough!</p>

<br/>
<h1>500030</h1>

<p>Hmph.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500040</h1>

<p>Gah! Lucky bastard.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500050</h1>

<p>Nay...'tis we who are lucky. Had we fought on, 'twas but a matter of time before our conflict claimed the life of an innocent bystander.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500060</h1>

<p>I thought the Heavens' Ward might come here as well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500070</h1>

<p>They came to the Temple Knights' headquarters?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500080</h1>

<p>Aye. Ser Grinnaux announced that the lord commander had been imprisoned under suspicion of heresy, and that the Heavens' Ward had been granted full authority in his stead.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500090</h1>

<p>Then the Heavens' Ward now commands the Temple Knights...</p>

<br/>
<h1>500100</h1>

<p>Those still loyal to Ser Aymeric answer to me. Alas, that amounts to but half our number.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500110</h1>

<p>The other half, who opposed his promotion to lord commander, have gathered at the Vault as ordered.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500120</h1>

<p>Bolsterin' the guard already, eh? If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're expected.</p>

<br/>
<h1>500130</h1>

<p>I take it you're in charge around here?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500140</h1>

<p>Hilda, and yes. The young master was just persuadin' me to join his lost cause. Convincin' little beggar, isn't he?</p>

<br/>
<h1>500150</h1>

<p>Aye, your passion moved me─a bit. That, and the fact that we're sick of livin' off the leavin's of our “betters.”</p>

<br/>
<h1>500160</h1>

<p>If you've a mind to change things around here, then we've a mind to join you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600010</h1>

<p>Our power... How can this be!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600020</h1>

<p>Fall back!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600030</h1>

<p>Father, please!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600041</h1>

<p>For a mercy, we were not too late.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600050</h1>

<p>Why must you do this, Father!?</p>

<br/>
<h1>600060</h1>

<p>Nidhogg is fallen! There is no need for further deception! Now is the time to renounce the lies which led us down this path─to start anew!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600070</h1>

<p>And tear down the very pillars of our society─our history, our values─everything we have built over a thousand years? <sigh> A fool to the last.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600080</h1>

<p>Look out!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600090</h1>

<p>Go. Azys Lla awaits.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600100</h1>

<p>Lord Haurchefant!</p>

<br/>
<h1>600105</h1>

<p>It's no good... The wound is too deep. It refuses to mend...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600110</h1>

<p>You...you are unharmed? F-Forgive me... I could not bear the thought of...of...</p>

<br/>
<h1>600120</h1>

<p>Oh, do not look at me so.</p>

<br/>
<h1>600121</h1>

<p>A smile better suits a hero...</p>

<br/>
<h1>700010</h1>

<p>Don't. Please.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700020</h1>

<p>A knight lives to serve. To protect. To sacrifice. There is no greater calling.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700030</h1>

<p>Leave me to mourn, and give chase. For my son, and for the nation he loved. Go.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700040</h1>

<p>...His sacrifice shall not be forgotten.</p>

<br/>
<h1>700050</h1>

<p>My son...</p>

<br/>
<h1>800010</h1>

<p>My friends. I am in your debt.</p>

<br/>
<h1>800020</h1>

<p>Think nothing of it. Your wounds are healing well, I trust?</p>

<br/>
<h1>800030</h1>

<p>Some wounds do not heal...</p>

<br/>
<h1>900010</h1>

<p>The founding, the scriptures─a thousand years of lies─all to deceive the common man!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900020</h1>

<p>Nay, our own brothers and sisters─for the blood of the knights twelve flows within all our veins! You knew this to be true. You knew and you concealed it!</p>

<br/>
<h1>900030</h1>

<p>I should be interested to hear how you came by this knowledge. But yes, you have the right of it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00010</h1>

<p>The architects of Ishgard, King Thordan and his knights twelve, entrapped and butchered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, that they might partake of her eyes, and thereby transcend their mortal limits.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00020</h1>

<p>Upon learning of their treachery, Nidhogg was consumed with a murderous─and justified─rage. I daresay you know what followed...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00030</h1>

<p>The great wyrm slew the king and half of his knights.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00040</h1>

<p>Aye...but Nidhogg was subdued, and his eyes plucked from their sockets by the knights that remained.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00050</h1>

<p>Their one mistake was to show mercy, for from his brother Hraesvelgr did Nidhogg receive a new eye, thus rejuvenating his form and empowering him to embark upon an eternal quest for vengeance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00060</h1>

<p>...Whilst Thordan's son Haldrath took one of Nidhogg's eyes and learned to wield its power in defense of his people...</p>

<br/>
<h1>A00070</h1>

<p>Thus was the first Azure Dragoon born. And ever since that time, his honored successors have risen to drive Nidhogg from our lands whenever the wyrm has returned to plague us.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00010</h1>

<p>I ask you, my son: will you answer for my sins? Will your son and his son answer for me as well?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00020</h1>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00030</h1>

<p>If a man cannot atone for his sins in the course of his all-too-fleeting life, must his progeny then be held to account? Must every subsequent generation be judged as well?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00040</h1>

<p>Thordan's betrayal of Ratatoskr was an unconscionable, unforgivable sin.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00050</h1>

<p>Should we, then, as his descendants, meekly surrender ourselves to an eternity of punishment?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00060</h1>

<p>Nay, say I. I would not see our children sacrificed in a vain attempt to appease an implacable foe.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00070</h1>

<p>Dragons are not like us, my son. To they who live forever, the wrongs of antiquity are as those of yesterday. No reparations shall ever suffice.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00080</h1>

<p>This fact alone should serve as ample justification for our actions, yet some refuse to see it as such. For men like you, who yearn to commit themselves to a nobler cause, a more compelling narrative is required.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00090</h1>

<p>This is your solution!? This is how you protect our people?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00100</h1>

<p>You have given us a lost cause! A death sentence! With your compelling narrative, you but doom our countrymen to give their lives for a lie!</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00110</h1>

<p>And they do so gladly. Highborn and lowborn alike are proud to serve─to fight and die for their country.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00120</h1>

<p>And what would you say to them?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00130</h1>

<p>What would you tell the wives who have lost their husbands, the mothers who have lost their sons? ...That their loved ones died for naught?</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00140</h1>

<p>I...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00150</h1>

<p>Over the course of a thousand years, countless men have donned these robes, and every one of them came to accept the necessity of this solution. Once, I hoped you might come to accept it as well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00160</h1>

<p>Do not despair, my son. Soon I shall free us from the sins of antiquity...</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00170</h1>

<p>...And bring about the change you so fervently desire.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00180</h1>

<p>If he has spoken with others, I would have their names. Escort him to a cell and question him─thoroughly.</p>

<br/>
<h1>B00190</h1>

<p>Your Eminence.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00010</h1>

<p>You saw something, did you not? A vision of the past?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00020</h1>

<p>So this is the power of the Echo. Would that it had shown you a finer moment from my past.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00030</h1>

<p>'Twas an exercise in futility, as you saw. Faced with the firmity of his conviction, and his many ready rejoinders, my words deserted me. To be frank, I am embarrassed to recall it.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00040</h1>

<p>A friend once impressed upon me the importance of differentiating between words, deeds, and beliefs. Were he here, I suspect he would judge your father's “conviction” to be no more than rank, self-serving delusion.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00050</h1>

<p>Even so, I cannot help but wonder what manner of “change” he intends to bring about.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00060</h1>

<p>I have given some thought to that as well.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00070</h1>

<p>During the battle within the Vault, the Heavens' Ward demonstrated strange and unnatural abilities.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00080</h1>

<p>Aye, the manner in which Ser Zephirin struck down Lord Haurchefant was unlike anything I've ever seen before.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00090</h1>

<p>The spectacle called to mind King Thordan and his knights twelve as they are depicted in scripture─holy powers and all...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00100</h1>

<p>Mere fabrications...which have become objects of faith...instilled with the belief of countless devoted souls...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00110</h1>

<p>Seven hells!</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00120</h1>

<p>If Lady Iceheart can use her own body as a vessel for summoning, I see no reason why others could not...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00130</h1>

<p>Are the Heavens' Ward truly so reckless?</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00140</h1>

<p>Unbelievable.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00150</h1>

<p>As they fled, my father spoke of Azys Lla.</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00160</h1>

<p>Though I know not what he intends, I fear no good shall come of it. His ambitions are too great, and his minions too powerful...</p>

<br/>
<h1>C00170</h1>

<p>We must find the Heavens' Ward, and stop my father, before it is too late.</p>

<br/>
<h1>BEHEST</h1>

<p>Guildhests are similar to guildleves in that clients in need of assistance petition the Adventurers' Guild to find them volunteers. Adventurers are then summoned at the guild's behest to undertake these tasks. The difference is that while guildleves can be accepted by individuals, guildhest operations will often require parties of four to eight persons.<br/>
Beyond that, the rules are simple. Finish the guildhest objectives before time expires, and you and your companions will be promptly rewarded for services rendered. Drag your feet, though, and you won't see a single coin.<br/>
If it is your first time tackling an operation, you will also be provided with a bonus upon completion.<br/>
Finally, proving yourself on the field will unlock more high-profile tasks. Other battlewardens stationed throughout the Twelveswood may also provide you with similar work, but only if you are deemed capable.</p>

<br/>
<h1>ERROR</h1>

<p>You were unable to commence the operation “.”</p>

<p>Wait... Might this be your first time participating in a guildhest? I remember my first hest. It was the night of my twentieth nameday. My fellow guildmates invited me to join them in the slaying of a family of peistes who were stealing chocobo eggs from Bentbranch Meadows.<br/>
The moment we arrived, one of the terrible beasts immediately turned to me and charged. The thing was thrice my size and had already maimed several chocobokeeps.<br/>
There was no way I could win, so I simply froze and waited for the end. But that's when I remembered that I was not alone. My friends rallied around me, and together we defeated the peistes! That, my friend, is what a guildhest is truly about.</p>

A linkshell enables you to communicate with others over any distance, as if they were before your very eyes!<br/>
You may have as many as eight linkshells open at any given time, allowing you to communicate simultaneously with any number of people. The only time your physical presence is required is...well, never!<br/>

Our loyal assistant is rewarded for her persistence! A new letter has arrived for you, kupo.<br/>
Kupo-ho-ho! I'm pleased to say that I have a new letter for you, my most proficient pupil!<br/>
Let me see now... Why, yes! I do have a new letter addressed to UNKNOWN. Isn't today your lucky day, kupo?<br/>
Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters, kupo!<br/>
Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters! I would have expected our favorite assistant to be more organized, kupo!<br/>
Your mailbox is filling up fast! I won't be able to fit in any more letters unless you do something, kupo! And then where will you be?<br/>
A consummate carrier like yourself letting her mailbox go unattended? This simply won't do, kupo! Do some cleaning, and with haste, lest there be no room for new deliveries!<br/>
Your mailbox is filling up fast! You should do something about it quick, or I won't be able to fit in any more letters!<br/>
Your mailbox is a complete and utter mess! There wasn't any room left, so I had to send back a letter, kupo!<br/>

Greetings, tall one! I'm a delivery moogle, kupo!<br/>
Oh, I know what you're thinking. “Moogles are supposed to hide in trees and avoid contact with outsiders! Whyever would they agree to carry about letters?”<br/>
"Why" indeed! If I had my way, I'd be curled up under the canopy of a nice oak dreaming about some beautiful mooglette with a rainbow-colored pom-pom, kupo!<br/>
But no, the moon had to go and drop from the sky, causing all of that terrible commotion! Aetherytes were shattered and linkpearls rendered useless. For moons, the poor, wingless people of Eorzea had no way of communicating with each other...beyond screaming at the top of their lungs, which no one really approved of, kupo.<br/>
That is, until the little horned ones asked us to assist them by delivering messages. At first we were wary of showing ourselves, worried that one of you might catch and skin us, like you do every other forest furry. But once we saw how much we were appreciated, we knew we'd found our new calling!<br/>
And I personally promise to try and not read any along the way, kupo!<br/>
Greetings and salutations! Wondering why I'm wearing this funny hat and toting around this oversized bag, kupo? Well, it just so happens that I had a dream the other night. A dream of moogles like me who spent their days delivering letters to travelers like you.<br/>
I thought, I could do that─so here I am! Should Feo Ul happen to receive any missives or epistles for you from beyond, I'll ensure that they safely find their way into your hands, kupo.<br/>
Your speedy and accurate deliveries have earned you carrier level one, kupo! And yet, a delivery moogle's work is never done. Should you see the deputy postmoogle outside Limsa Lominsa's Bulwark Hall, that's your sign that we have another job for you!<br/>
Your unflagging dedication to letter delivery has earned you carrier level one, kupo! I'm not certain what that means, I'm afraid, but Feo Ul insisted that I pass on the word. They also mentioned that if you're looking for more work, you should speak to the moogle who looks like me, but lives by the sea beyond.<br/>
Your postal prowess has earned you carrier level one, kupo! A letter carrier's heart is a restless one, always thinking of the next job. If the deputy postmoogle has another letter for you, he'll be outside Limsa Lominsa's Bulwark Hall. Run to him, kupo. Run, don't walk!<br/>
I must convey my congratulations again! Where once stood a rank amateur, now stands a veritable maestro of mail carrying, kupo. The countless postmoogles you have inspired are carrying your torch well. We may call upon you again, but until that day─stay safe in your adventures!<br/>
Feo Ul was saying that the delivery moogles from “beyond”─wherever that is, kupo─have high hopes for you! I wonder if they have high hopes for me, too?<br/>
Every day, I train and toil that I might one day be as peerlessly proficient at my profession as the postmoogle I met in my dreams, kupo!</p>

Tataru

<h1>Tataru Taru<br/>
Scion of the Seventh Dawn
Coinkeeper</h1>

<p>Though publicly known as the organization's receptionist, Tataru also serves as the Scions' coinkeeper─a role she executes with an enthusiastic cunning that borders on the terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
Born to Ul'dahn merchants, the young Tataru had everything a Lalafell could ask for─until her family lost it all to bankruptcy. Plagued by debt and still smarting from this abrupt introduction to the harsh realities of the sultanate, she apprenticed herself to a lapidary at the age of twelve, and henceforth supported the household with her meager earnings. It was during this period that she met Minfilia─a miner come to sell gems and ore─who would later recruit Tataru to oversee the Path of the Twelve's finances.<br/>
<br/>
Tataru, in turn, resolved to use her newfound position not only to accrue personal wealth, but also to serve others. Indeed, when the Path of the Twelve relocated to the Waking Sands, and her role was expanded to include secretarial duties, she used her considerable social acumen to build relationships and increase its influence. As the organization slowly but surely grew into an association of like-minded and gifted souls, she was instrumental in seeking out potential members blessed with the Echo.<br/>
<br/>
After the Seventh Umbral Calamity, when the Path of the Twelve merged with the Circle of Knowing to form the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, Tataru continued her tenure as secretary and coinkeeper combined. When the political situation in Ul'dah drove the Scions from their headquarters for a time, she journeyed with Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to Ishgard, that they might there regroup and rebuild the organization. Later, she accompanied a contingent of Scions to the Far East, where she established ties with the East Aldenard Trading Company's Kugane branch in order to fund local anti-imperial resistance efforts─one of her many laudable ventures on the Scions' behalf.<br/>
<br/>
Privately, Tataru has long regretted her inability to assist her comrades in martial endeavors, and thus sought to train as an arcanist. Alas, these efforts met with misfortune, including the escape of her Carbuncle companion, and so she has since resolved to provide financial support through trades such as mining and weaving. In so doing, she has become something of a master artisan─going so far as to establish her own boutique in Old Sharlayan─yet she always manages to find the time to fashion new outfits for her Scion friends when they stand poised upon the threshold of journeys new.</p>

The Scions of the Seventh Dawn

<h1>The Scions of the Seventh Dawn</h1>

<p>This secret society was the product of a merger between the Circle of Knowing, led by Louisoix Leveilleur, and the Path of the Twelve, led by Minfilia Warde, following the Seventh Umbral Calamity.<br/>
<br/>
Working in concert with the leaders of Eorzea, the Scions strove to address the myriad problems that plagued the realm, be it the godlike primals, the imperialistic Garleans, or the scheming Ascians─beings who have long shaped history from the shadows. As a means to achieve its objectives, the society sought out those blessed with the Echo, a mysterious power with myriad manifestations, the most notable of which was the ability to walk in the memories of others. It was for this reason they extended an invitation to the Warrior of Light.<br/>
<br/>
On account of their contributions in dealing with several primals and the XIVth Imperial Legion, the Scions' existence became public knowledge. Utilizing their newfound reputation, Alphinaud Leveilleur founded the Crystal Braves, a military organization intended to pave the way for a unified Eorzea. However, the society's activities had made it the target of a Monetarist faction of Ul'dah, and an elaborate betrayal by Alphinaud's presumed allies resulted in the Scions being framed for the sultana's assassination. Though branded fugitives and scattered for a time, they eventually learned of a plot within a plot that saw the monarch put into a deep slumber rather than slain, and succeeded in clearing their names.<br/>
<br/>
Their honor restored, the Scions went on to become key players in the liberation of Ala Mhigo and Doma from imperial rule, and after helping to avert the Final Days, they judged their mission fulfilled. So it was that they announced their disbandment─at least outwardly─and retreated from plain sight to labor in secret once more.</p>

[UNENDING CODEX]

The Final Days

<h1>The Final Days</h1>

<p>This dreadful calamity befell the star in the distant past, when it was known as Etheirys.<br/>
<br/>
In that shining age, men had the power to manifest anything at will, even living beings, and through this miraculous creation magick, their civilization thrived. One day, however, following a keening sound from the land, their magicks ran rampant, giving form to eldritch horrors born of fear and despair. Their blissful lives became a waking nightmare, and mankind was driven to the brink of extinction.<br/>
<br/>
The Convocation of Fourteen, the people's chosen representatives, observed that the phenomenon manifested where the celestial currents, the star's outermost flow of aether, had grown weak and stagnant. In order to address this deficiency, they summoned forth the mighty Zodiark to exert control over the laws of creation. Though this act demanded a high price─the sacrifice of half of mankind's remaining number─the vast majority willingly rendered up their lives, and thus were the Final Days forestalled.<br/>
<br/>
Over the intervening millennia, this star-encompassing calamity had faded from memory. But faced with its second coming as engineered by the Telophoroi, the Scions of the Seventh Dawn embarked upon a desperate quest for the truth. At length, they discovered that an ancient named Hermes had created Meteion, a being capable of traversing the great expanse, to ascertain the meaning of life by seeking out other civilizations in the universe. Alas, Meteion and her sisters found naught but despair, driving them to conclude life was suffering and death the sole mercy. Fleeing to the edge of existence, they became the Endsinger, and proceeded to unleash the power of dynamis, an esoteric energy set in motion by feelings, to usher all stars to their doom, that life need not continue in vain.<br/>
<br/>
Despite seemingly insurmountable odds, the Scions held fast to hope, and amidst darkest despair lit the way for their champion as they confronted the Endsinger at her nest. And at the end of a fierce battle, they emerged triumphant, and put an end to the Final Days once and for all.</p>

Estinien

<h1>Estinien Varlineau<br/>
Scion of the Seventh Dawn
Dragoon</h1>

<p>One of Ishgard's most capable knights, Estinien─called “Wyrmblood” by many─once led his order as the renowned Azure Dragoon.<br/>
<br/>
Estinien's origins are humble, having been born to a family of sheepherders in the eastern highlands of Coerthas. However, the course of his pastoral life was forever changed when his village of Ferndale was razed by the great wyrm Nidhogg─an attack which claimed the lives of his parents and his brother.<br/>
<br/>
Bereft of home and family, the orphan of twelve summers was taken in by Alberic, then holder of the title of Azure Dragoon. The two proceeded to forge a complicated relationship. A martial instructor, an adoptive father, and a flawed knight─one who failed to protect his family. To the young Estinien, Alberic was all these things and more.<br/>
<br/>
When his training was complete, Estinien joined the Temple Knights. So focused was he on the fight against the Dravanian Horde that he scarcely remembered the names of his companions. His sole friendship was with Aymeric de Borel, a knight of similar age who shared Estinien's passion for the cause. Estinien's prowess saw him rise through the ranks, first becoming a dragoon, and later inheriting the title of Azure Dragoon once held by his foster father.<br/>
<br/>
Like all Azure Dragoons, Estinien would carry with him the Eye of Nidhogg─a relic torn from the wyrm's head over a thousand years ago. Though the Eye conferred power to the bearer, it rendered them vulnerable to Nidhogg's influence, and his undying hatred threatened to consume Estinien's very soul. Only through constant vigilance and strength of will did Estinien maintain a grip on his sanity─though there were occasions when he came perilously close to succumbing to Nidhogg's rancor.<br/>
<br/>
In the midst of the Dragonsong War, Estinien offered to accompany the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud Leveilleur in their quest to convince the Dravanians to renounce their thousand-year campaign of vengeance. Though he did not believe they would succeed, Estinien nevertheless agreed to eschew violence─unless circumstances forced his hand. They were later joined by Ysayle, leader of the heretics, who similarly believed peace an unlikely prospect, but one still worth pursuing in earnest.<br/>
<br/>
Estinien traveled with the others to the Churning Mists, where they sought an audience with Hraesvelgr, brother of Nidhogg. From the great wyrm they learned the truth of the Dragonsong War: that it was King Thordan of ancient Ishgard who drew first blood when he and his knights murdered the great wyrm Ratatoskr, and subsequently devoured her eyes so that they might claim her power for themselves. Yet in spite of this truth, the fact remained that Nidhogg was intent upon the destruction of Ishgard, and if he could not be persuaded to yield, they had but one recourse. In the end, the Azure Dragoon succeeded in hunting down and slaying his archenemy, presumably ending the thousand-year war.<br/>
<br/>
Upon their return to the capital, Estinien and his companions discovered that Archbishop Thordan VII had plotted to wield the power of a primal to transform himself into an eternal god-king and bless the world with his twisted idea of harmony. They pursued the archbishop to Azys Lla, where they put an end to his machinations once and for all. However, in the wake of the battle, Estinien succumbed to the all-consuming hatred within Nidhogg's two eyes, transforming into a vessel for the wyrm's shade that would marshal his forces for a final assault on Ishgard. Following his defeat on the Steps of Faith, Estinien regained partial control and urged Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light to kill him, but instead the two tore the eyes from his body, casting out Nidhogg's shade and saving the dragoon's life.<br/>
<br/>
With his homeland entering an age of peace, Estinien renounced his title of Azure Dragoon and set off on a journey of his own. Even during these wanderings, though, he stayed abreast of the Scions' activities, and participated in both the liberation of Ala Mhigo and sabotage efforts within Garlemald. In time, he gave in to the relentless solicitations of Tataru and Krile, officially becoming a Scion and working tirelessly with his comrades to deliver the world from the calamity known as the Final Days.<br/>
<br/>
Following his long journey from archnemesis of dragons to their friend and brother, Estinien renamed his lance Nidhogg after his fallen foe. Though he is still a lone wolf at heart, he travels more often with others than before─such as to the isle of Thavnair, where he has forged a new friendship with Vrtra, another of the first brood.</p>

G'raha

<h1>G'raha Tia<br/>
Scion of the Seventh Dawn
All-rounder</h1>

<p>A relatively recent addition to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, G'raha Tia hails from Corvos in southern Ilsabard, where the Allagan Empire once flourished during the Third Astral Era. Although the Miqo'te were once forced to toil in obscurity for the glory of Allag, G'raha Tia's tribe, ever proud, devoted themselves to the study and preservation of arcane secrets. Thousands of years later, when Corvos was conquered by the Garleans and brought under the jurisdiction of the illustrious House Darnus, a young G'raha─heir to vast stores of Allagan knowledge and the last child born with the Allagan Eye, was given into the custody of the Students of Baldesion.<br/>
<br/>
After acquiring Sharlayan citizenship and freedom from more mundane duties, G'raha concentrated on his education, earning his Archon's mark for his groundbreaking research into ancient arcane wisdom. Owing to these qualifications, G'raha Tia was tasked with the vital duty of investigating the Crystal Tower, the most fascinating and forbidding of the surviving relics of the Allagan Empire. It was during this expedition that he met with Rammbroes of the Sons of Saint Coinach, Cid Garlond of the Ironworks, and the Warrior of Light─an occasion which led to the formation of the fellowship known as NOAH.<br/>
<br/>
With his newfound companions, he laid bare the secrets of ancient Allag, and learned from the awakened clones Unei and Doga that the eye he inherited was, in truth, the Royal Eye, the unmistakable mark of the Allagan imperial family. With it, he could control the Crystal Tower itself, per the wishes of Salina, the final princess of Allag, who had chosen to pass down this gift and place her trust in future generations.<br/>
<br/>
Judging that mankind was not yet ready for the secrets of the Crystal Tower, G'raha Tia sealed himself within it, in the hope that he might awaken in an age when his fellow man had set aside their differences─when they might truly comprehend and wield the Allagan knowledge for the benefit of all.<br/>
<br/>
Alas, when G'raha awoke from his slumber two hundred years later, the world had been ravaged by tragedy and death, for the Eighth Umbral Calamity had come to pass. Biggs─third of his name and eighteenth chairman of Garlond Ironworks─had cracked the tower's wards, seeking to harness the power within to develop a means of time travel, that they might forge a future in which the Calamity had never occurred. G'raha agreed to lend them his aid, and so it was that he and the Crystal Tower were transported into the past─not of their world, the Source, but of the reflection known as the First, where fate would once again see him reunited with the Warrior of Light.<br/>
<br/>
The First, for its part, had suffered a calamity no less daunting than that of the Source. A Flood of Light had nearly extinguished all life, and what little remained was beset by horrors born of the phenomenon known as sin eaters. Unaged due to his symbiosis with the Crystal Tower, an ever-youthful G'raha Tia took the initiative in building the Crystarium─a city and bulwark of hope where he and his growing community would stand against these foes.<br/>
<br/>
For a hundred years, the Crystal Exarch─as G'raha Tia had come to be known─laid the groundwork for the coming battle, for he had always known that he could not triumph without the Warrior of Light. When the time came, he summoned the champion and their allies─albeit accidentally─from the Source, assembling a formidable alliance to take up arms against the Lightwardens and reclaim the long-absent night sky.<br/>
<br/>
The final step in G'raha Tia's plan would have seen him render up his own life for the preservation of the First and the Source. Blessedly, this sacrifice did not come to pass. Ultimately, the Warrior of Light and their brave companions succeeded in laying low the Ascians Emet-Selch and Elidibus, ending the threat of an Eighth Umbral Calamity and giving the First hope for a brighter tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
When the Scions at last returned to their own world, they did not do so alone. G'raha Tia had conceived a method in which his memories and essence in the First could be merged with his past self still sleeping within the Crystal Tower of the Source. The awoken G'raha Tia eagerly joined the ranks of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn and proceeded to employ his ample knowledge of all things Allagan, as well as the leadership skills he honed as the Crystal Exarch, to provide invaluable guidance and support to his companions. In particular, his decisive actions in Thavnair during the Final Days ensured the survival of countless innocents.<br/>
<br/>
After the de facto disbanding of the Scions, G'raha Tia joined Krile in helping to rebuild the Students of Baldesion. However, he has not yet shaken his wanderlust, and will not hesitate to seize any opportunity to embark upon a new journey with the Warrior of Light.</p>

Krile

<h1>Krile Baldesion<br/>
Scion of the Seventh Dawn
Mage</h1>

<p>Orphaned as a child and taken in by Galuf Baldesion, founder of the eponymous Students of Baldesion, Krile was blessed with power of the Echo─though in her early years it seemed to her more a curse. Uncommonly sensitive to the feelings of others, unwelcome thoughts flooded her mind, leading her to develop a guarded personality that many found off-putting. Seeing this, Galuf gave her a cat-eared hood, assuring her that her gift was not something to be bemoaned, and that it would one day prove a tremendous strength. Moved by her grandfather's words, Krile vowed to devote herself to her studies, that she might use her power to serve the greater good.<br/>
<br/>
Displaying a remarkable aptitude in the mystic arts, Krile attended the Studium in Sharlayan, joining the Faculty of the Arcane and becoming highly skilled in healing and curing magicks. It was at this time that she made the acquaintance of Alphinaud and Alisaie Leveilleur, with whom she maintains a close friendship to this day. After graduation, she joined her grandfather's research organization, eventually coming to Eorzea to support the Scions of the Seventh Dawn as they rebuilt their operation following the bloody banquet in Ul'dah. She lent her impressive knowledge of the arcane to the search for the missing Minfilia.<br/>
<br/>
Krile chose to remain in Eorzea for the foreseeable future, both out of a desire to support her friends, and for lack of a home to which she might return. Prior to her arrival, the Isle of Val was obliterated by a devastating spell akin to Ultima. While she herself was on the isle at the time, she was saved by the blessing of Light, and so she naturally fell in with the Scions. She soon became a full-fledged member, and thenceforth used her command of the Echo to serve her comrades on many an occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Krile suffered a particularly harrowing experience when she was captured as a prisoner of war by the Garleans during the campaign to liberate Ala Mhigo. Her Echo made her a target, as the magitek engineer Aulus mal Asina sought to study the phenomenon and create an artificial variant. He succeeded in this endeavor, transforming Fordola rem Lupis and Zenos yae Galvus into beings he dubbed the Resonant. Krile was later rescued by the Scions, and after recovering from the ordeal resolved to repay the favor. Indeed, when her companions were forcefully summoned to the First and left in a comatose state, Krile took the lead in nursing the Scions back to health.<br/>
<br/>
With the appearance of the Telophoroi and the looming threat of the Final Days, Krile returned to Sharlayan in hopes of gauging the true intentions of their governing body, the Forum, which to that point had stubbornly refused to approve any aid to Eorzea. Subsequently, she would use her influence as representative of the Students of Baldesion to arrange for her friends to visit Old Sharlayan.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the Final Days have been averted and the Scions ostensibly disbanded, Krile has devoted herself to the restoration of the Students, recruiting the precious few survivors she has found, along with new talent, that together they might carry on her late grandfather's legacy and preserve their knowledge for future generations.</p>

Y'shtola

<h1>Y'shtola Rhul<br/>
Scion of the Seventh Dawn
Sorceress</h1>

<p>Displaying prodigious aptitude for magic from a young age, Y'shtola—at the behest of the Sharlayan Forum—was sent to Master Matoya for tutelage at the tender age of seven. Resentful of having to mind a child instead of pursuing her own research, the revered Archon was a stern taskmaster, imposing upon her new student one harsh trial after the next. Y'shtola, for her part, did not shirk from these formidable tasks, eventually winning the approval of her mentor—who doubtless saw in the stubborn Miqo'te girl shades of her own self as a child. After ten years of training, Y'shtola emerged from Matoya's cave a woman grown, possessed of vast knowledge and skill in the arcane that easily earned her the title of Archon.<br/>
<br/>
Striking out on her own, Y'shtola joined the Circle of Knowing, led by her mentor's colleague and friend Louisoix Leveilleur. Sailing to Eorzea, she assisted her friends in their efforts in Limsa Lominsa in the fateful days leading up to the Seventh Umbral Calamity. During that time, she won the trust of Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn, to whom she lent invaluable assistance in rebuilding the Eorzean Alliance, which had theretofore devolved into a shell of its former glory. After Louisoix gave his life on the fields of Carteneau, Y'shtola became one of the founding members of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, formed by the merger of her own Circle of Knowing with a like-minded organization, the Path of the Twelve.<br/>
<br/>
Together with her new companions, she worked tirelessly to quell the threat of the primals and defend Eorzea from the invasion of Garlemald's XIVth Imperial Legion. When the Scions were caught up in the political coup in Ul'dah, it was Y'shtola's command of forbidden and ancient teleportation magicks that allowed her and Thancred to escape the clutches of the villainous Crystal Braves. Left to wander the Lifestream as a result of this, she was on the verge of being lost forever to the aetheric currents when she was rescued and called back to this world through the efforts of Kan-E-Senna and the Warrior of Light. Y'shtola awoke from her coma to find she had lost the physical ability of sight, gaining in its stead the power to see aether in the environment around her. This gift is a double-edged sword, however—for while it allows her to remain a formidable presence in battle, the strain it places on her mind and energies is often great.<br/>
<br/>
Having recovered her strength, Y'shtola joined her fellow Scions in their exploits across Eorzea, traveling to Azys Lla to depose the mad Archbishop Thordan VII and bring the Dragonsong War to an end, then playing a key role in the liberation of Ala Mhigo.<br/>
<br/>
Y'shtola once again suffered a harrowing experience when her soul was accidentally forcefully summoned to the First by the Crystal Exarch. Assuming the alias “Matoya” in honor of her mentor and concealing her true identity, she befriended the Night's Blessed, a group of Dark-worshipers who made their home in the depths of the Rak'tika Greatwood. It was around this time that Y'shtola came to make extensive use of destructive magicks to complement the healing and curing arts at which she had always excelled.<br/>
<br/>
After the Scions succeeded in restoring the darkness to the Light-blighted First, they returned home to the Source, where Y'shtola would again play an invaluable role in averting the dark designs of the Telophoroi—in the end journeying with her friends to Ultima Thule to deliver their world from the Final Days.<br/>
<br/>
Having long served the now-disbanded Scions with her boundless knowledge and puissant sorcery, Y'shtola now strives to find an answer to the universe's most fundamental question—seeking the truth of creation to honor the legacy of her mentor, Master Matoya.</p>

Hydaelyn

<h1>Hydaelyn<br/>
Primal</h1>

<p>The will of the star, 'tis She who has long kept Etheirys turning.<br/>
<br/>
Tales of Hydaelyn's call and the singular power it was said to bestow─the Echo─ have been recorded throughout history. The nature of this power was not wholly understood, and it was often conflated with another of Her gifts, the “blessing of Light,” which ensured one's aether would remain uncorrupted by primal tempering. The chosen few also spoke of being summoned to the heart of the star where, according to their testaments, awaited a pure and towering crystal. It is likely that said testaments gave rise to the appellation “Mothercrystal,” as well as the usage of “Hydaelyn” to refer to the star itself, though the precise point at which these terms became commonplace remains unknown. While many sought further knowledge of Her nature─the Sharlayan Forum foremost among them─few ascertained Hydaelyn's true identity: a primal with an ancient, Venat, at Her core.<br/>
<br/>
In a time before time, society was governed by the Convocation of Fourteen, upon which Venat held the seat of Azem. An indefatigable and insatiably curious individual, she tired of the academic approach to natural studies, and resolved instead to travel the star and seek its truths through firsthand experience─a journey that she continued even after she abdicated her position. One day, during a visit to Elpis, she chanced to meet with the Warrior of Light, who had come from the future with a warning of calamities to come. Thus did she learn of the Final Days that would befall Etheirys, and of this tragedy's ultimate cause: Meteion, bearer of myriad fallen worlds' despair.<br/>
<br/>
To prevent the obliteration of all life, Venat embarked upon a quest that would span millennia. Offering up her own flesh and soul, she summoned and became Hydaelyn. She sundered Her people, who yearned for a past that could never be restored; the god Zodiark, manifestation of that ill-fated wish; and the star itself, which She loved so dearly, into fourteen pieces. The god of Darkness was gaoled within the sundered worlds' moons, and their people condemned to a fragile and imperfect existence forevermore. However, She knew that from their imperfection─their suffering─would arise the strength to face deepest despair.<br/>
<br/>
So passionate was Her love for mankind, so unwavering Her faith in its potential, that Hydaelyn would never, in the eons that followed, waver in Her belief. Even as shard after shard fell to calamity and were rejoined with the Source, empowering Zodiark as it enervated Her in turn, She stayed the course, awaiting the day when man would prove himself worthy. When at last the time came, and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn triumphed over Her in a battle that burned through Her very soul, She faded away with a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Warrior of Light and their comrades would go on to follow the path She had shown them, Hydaelyn was no more. Her love for Her children, however, is eternal.</p>

The Reflections

<h1>The Reflections</h1>

<p>Though few are aware of their true nature, these worlds exist in parallel to the one in which we live, the Source.<br/>
<br/>
In order to weaken and imprison Zodiark, Hydaelyn mustered Her strength and sundered the very fabric of reality, causing the world to be split into fourteen shards, akin to identical, diluted images. Being reflections, the geographical features of these worlds are naturally similar, akin to observing the original through a looking glass. But over the course of millennia, the peoples of each have lived disparate lives and histories, and some variance has manifested in the environment itself as well. Since the reflections were birthed forth, seven have been lost, sacrificed in the Ascians' quest to restore the ancient world.<br/>
<br/>
Curiously, while the reflections are displaced from each other, the boundaries between them are not uniform; certain worlds, such as the First and the Thirteenth, are more readily accessible from the Source, while others are not. One theory posits that the worlds exist within pockets of reality that are arranged in a pattern not unlike the numbers on a clockface, and that it is easier to travel to an adjacent reflection.</p>

The Crystal Tower

<h1>The Crystal Tower</h1>

<p>Approximately six millennia ago, when the world still languished in the aftermath of the Third Umbral Calamity, there arose a man who led an army of mages on a campaign of conquest. Xande would go on to found the storied Allagan Empire, as well as marry the secrets of magic and wisdom of science to create aetherochemistry. Through advances in this miraculous field, he expanded his dominion to encompass the continents of Aldenard, Ilsabard, and Othard.<br/>
<br/>
However, generations of peace and prosperity gave rise to decadence, and a thousand years after the nation's birth, progress all but ground to a halt. The people grew complacent, abandoning learning and drowning themselves in leisure, and society stagnated. None lamented this deplorable state of affairs more than a technologist named Amon.<br/>
<br/>
Desiring to restore his nation to its former glory, Amon brought Emperor Xande back from the grave. Under the founding father's leadership, the empire was given renewed purpose in world domination. In order to bolster the might of his armies, Xande entered into a pact with the Cloud of Darkness, a sovereign among voidsent, and granted their kind passage to the world of men in return for their aid in assuring the supremacy of his reign.<br/>
<br/>
The Crystal Tower played a key role in all of these events. Built to harness the power of the sun, it provided the sprawling empire with energy during its heyday. When the empire fell into decline, Amon used that selfsame energy to resurrect Xande, and Xande in turn used it to open a gate to the void.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the emperor resolved to welcome the Cloud of Darkness herself into our world, a feat which would require a voidgate of heretofore unseen proportions. To this end, he commanded that the eikon Bahamut, captured in Meracydia, be encapsulated within a massive iron sphere. The sphere was launched into the heavens and set into motion alongside the moon, where it utilized the wyrm's affinity to fire-aspected aether to accumulate solar energy in a more concentrated form. Yet while the tower had been fortified to channel the increased flow, the land upon which it had been built could not withstand the immense forces. The Crystal Tower's collapse triggered a series of earthquakes which shook the entire realm, bringing about the Fourth Umbral Calamity and consigning the Allagan Empire to oblivion.<br/>
<br/>
For five millennia the Crystal Tower lay buried and forgotten, until the violence of the Seventh Umbral Era coaxed it from its resting place. Awakened from his long slumber, Emperor Xande once more sought to fulfill his nihilistic ambitions, but he would be thwarted by the stout souls of the fellowship of NOAH and their newfound comrades from the distant past.</p>

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>These docks provide safe mooring for the Thalassocratic Navy's principal squadrons, also known as the Crimson Fleet.

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Registered as a trade vessel hailing from foreign waters, this battle-scarred warship captained by the lord of the region's underworld, Hyllfyr, serves as a gathering place for brigands, cutthroats, and the purveyors of sundry other breeds of villainy.

<h1>Description</h1>

<p>Once an endless expanse of flat, rocky meadows, middle La Noscea is now severed atwain by a sheer cliff known as the Descent.

[BOZJA NOTE]

Bajsaljen Ulgasch

<p>Race: Hrothgar<br/>
Age: 54<br/>
Birthplace: Bozja<br/>
<br/>
A native of Bozja and leader of his people's resistance movement, Bajsaljen works to free his conquered nation from the tyranny of the Garlean Empire and reestablish the region as an independent state.<br/>
<br/>
In his youth, Bajsaljen studied the medicinal sciences. His academic achievements saw him conscripted into the imperial army to serve as a medic, a career which in turn earned him the rights of citizenship. Such status allowed him the opportunity to marry and sire a child, but his happiness would be short-lived─while the Hrothgar was called away on campaign to suppress an uprising, his family perished in the now-infamous Bozja incident.<br/>
<br/>
A devastated Bajsaljen later deserted the Empire, fleeing his unit along with several comrades, and it was not long until their underground activities brought them into contact with the Resistance.<br/>
<br/>
During his time in the imperial army, he had not been one to dwell upon the cruelties of life. The events of the disaster, however, left him a changed man─few can match the hatred and bitterness he now feels towards his former masters.<br/>
<br/>
Yet even so, Bajsaljen strives to master his emotions, for history has taught him that anger alone will not suffice to deliver his people the freedom they desire. Instead, he focuses his energies upon the newly reformed Gunnhildr's Blades and their sacred weapons, as he leads the fight to drive the IVth Imperial Legion from his beloved homeland.</p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Marsak Apella

<p>Race: Hrothgar<br/>
Age: 42<br/>
Birthplace: Bozja<br/>
<br/>
Like many others, Marsak was a conscript in the imperial army. His duties often took him far from home, and he was thus spared the fate of his parents and siblings when destruction visited Bozja Citadel. Following the tragedy, he escaped the military to join the Resistance, and now serves as Bajsaljen's right-hand man.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to attending to the Resistance leader, Marsak is responsible for procuring funds and supplies, as well as the training of recruits. Where the warm-natured Hrothgar truly shines, however, is in his capacity as a liaison with outside allies such as Hien of Doma or the East Aldenard Trading Company, contacts with whom he has built a trustworthy reputation.<br/>
<br/>
This amiability extends even to the citizens of the Empire, amongst whom he was once raised. Marsak, by his own quiet admission, chooses to save his animosity for the imperial state rather than its people. Although some might consider such attitudes too soft-hearted, it is this gentle manner which sets the otherwise guarded minds of his counterparts at ease.<br/>
<br/>
An avid student of Rostik's gunbreaker techniques, Marsak is also admired for his martial talents, and has earned his name as a stalwart shield for the Bozjan Resistance.</p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Xeven Svanasch

<p>Race: Hrothgar<br/>
Age: 47<br/>
Birthplace: Bozja (unverified)<br/>
<br/>
Xeven is a member of Gunnhildr's Blades, and assumed to be a native of Bozja...though none claim to know this for certain. Notoriously reticent, the little he has divulged of his past suggests his road led through many lands─Thavnair to the south, Hingashi to the east, even the imperial capital of Garlemald to the north─in his quest to master the arts of the arcane.<br/>
<br/>
His obsession with magery began with a journey to Eorzea. He had traveled with his father to Gridania, desperate to find a cure to the wasting disease which afflicted his mother. Their efforts, however, were to be in vain─the illness took her life even as they sought the means to her salvation. Knowing only that his mother's ailment began with the Empire's occupation of Bozja, the young Xeven's grief soon grew into a wrathful hunger for vengeance against those he held responsible for her passing.<br/>
<br/>
He considered the magecraft he had witnessed in his travels, and swore to take that knowledge back with him to Bozja. He would make his own study of the world's magicks, and bring those powers to bear against the imperial invaders.<br/>
<br/>
Yet although Xeven succeeded in creating a unique school of spellweaving, he refrained from sharing this expertise with others. He simply could not risk his wisdom─focused as it was on dealing destruction─becoming the catalyst for misery in the hands of an unscrupulous practitioner.<br/>
<br/>
Xeven himself soon became a peerless mage, his presence on the battlefield akin to a vengeful god, inspiring awe and terror in equal measure. He does not fear death. He tempts it─welcomes it, even. Such fatalism stems from a prophecy pronounced upon him by a seer of unknown origin, whom he chanced across in the ruined halls of Dalmasca. Though the words spoken were foreign to his ear, Xeven was nevertheless able to divine their meaning: when the fires of revolution stained the skies of Bozja, his doom would be at hand.<br/>
<br/>
And now that the southern front is consumed by turmoil, he believes it is there that his grave awaits. He will not seek to avoid this fate, but carve a red trail through his foes as a proud blade of Gunnhildr, until such time as his inevitable demise rises up to claim him. He does not fear death.<br/>
<br/>
With every moment that passes, the prophecy edges ever closer to fulfillment.</p>

Isolde Covey

<p>Race: Hyur<br/>
Age: 26<br/>
Birthplace: Lea Monde, Dalmasca<br/>
<br/>
Isolde's parents were respected Bozjans who fled to Dalmasca when war engulfed their homeland, only to look on helplessly as their new haven was forced to join the growing number of imperial provinces. Exhausted by conflict, the Coveys declined the Empire's offer to return them to Bozja with their fellow refugees, electing instead to settle in Lea Monde. Thus was Isolde born a provincial citizen, and educated in the imperial doctrine. Her heart, however, was ever drawn to the traditional music and dance of her Bozjan heritage─the frenzied tempo of its rhythms; the soaring peaks and plunging valleys of its melodies. Its lyrics told the tale of her people's lives and bond with nature, stories of love plucked on strings and beat on drums. Atop this was layered the dancers' song, strident voices blending with the booming steps of their furious measure.<br/>
<br/>
From a young age, Isolde dreamed of becoming such a dancer, and so intense was her passion that others began to see her as the hope for a new generation of performers. To realize this dream, however, she would also need to learn the bow. The weapon doubled as an instrument in Bozjan dance, using one bow to saw on the string of another, or twanging the bowstring to keep time. But custom dictated that the bow be no mere prop. As a mark of respect for their ancestors, who were once nomadic hunters, all dancers were fully trained in its use.<br/>
<br/>
Thus when Isolde joined the Resistance she was already an accomplished archer, her steady hand and keen eye soon earning her a place as one of Gunnhildr's Blades.<br/>
<br/>
Yet even amongst the ceaseless violence, she harbors an abiding love and respect for what the people of the land once had...and hopes they might one day have again. Isolde yearns for peace to come swiftly, not only for the sake of Bozja, but for the Empire as well.</p>

Stanik Alubov

<p>Race: Hrothgar<br/>
Age: 36<br/>
Birthplace: Bozja<br/>
<br/>
Long before he joined the ranks of Gunnhildr's Blades, Stanik had dreamed of becoming a hero.<br/>
<br/>
Life under imperial rule was, for the great majority of Bozjans, a daily struggle against poverty, and the same held true for Stanik's parents─a slow day at the little stall they ran meant no food on the table that night. No coin could be spared to send Stanik to school, and that, too, was not uncommon. Stanik himself did what he could to earn money, whether that be minding the neighbors' children or polishing boots on the street, but no matter how bad things were, he never resorted to thieving. His parents had always taught him that being poor was no excuse for poor morals.<br/>
<br/>
At the age of fifteen, Stanik presented himself at the imperial army's conscription office for evaluation, and was accepted as a soldier. He did this not because he sought a soldier's glory, but rather to ease the burden on his parents by giving them one less mouth to feed.<br/>
<br/>
Of his meager wages, he sent home what he could. Though it be but a pittance, it sometimes helped Stanik feel like the hero he yearned to become. The letters he received in return were his sole source of comfort, evidence as they were that his parents yet survived.<br/>
<br/>
Stanik was stationed at a distant post when reports of the “incident” flooded in. A message arrived from his parents five days later, and he felt a rush of relief...until he saw the numbers neatly printed in the corner. It was dated one day before Bozja Citadel all but ceased to exist...</p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Blaz Azetina

<p>Race: Hrothgar<br/>
Age: 25<br/>
Birthplace: Doma<br/>
<br/>
Blaz is a samurai, and direct descendant of the founders of the Verdant Path, an illustrious martial school famous for teaching everything from unarmed combat to swordplay to spear techniques.<br/>
<br/>
The school had a history of forbidding its disciples from engaging in uprisings, adhering to the philosophy that martial perfection was to serve the enlightenment of the soul─not sharpen tools for base conflict. When insurrection broke out in Bozja, however, there were students whose hatred for the Empire overwhelmed their stoic sense of obedience. Those who joined the fight were expelled, and so did the Verdant Path avoid confrontation with the Empire's forces.<br/>
<br/>
Despite being the youngest child of the school's founding family, Blaz's father also chose to rebel against his teachings and lend his blade to the Bozjan cause. In the end, however, the uprising was crushed. Blaz's father took shelter in Doma, where he was to eventually wed, and, as time passed, be blessed with a son.<br/>
<br/>
Blaz, following in his sire's martial footsteps, entered a prestigious samurai school, and mastered the katana at a young age. Some years later, when Hien returned from exile to lead his nation in revolution, the eager Hrothgar seized the opportunity to repay his family's debt to Doma. Once Doma's liberation was secured, Blaz made ready to strike out on his own. But after hearing rumors of the Eastern alliance and the new uprising in Bozja, he knew his road must lead to his father's homeland.<br/>
<br/>
The Verdant Path was experiencing upheaval of its own at this time, with the newly appointed schoolmaster championing the cause of rebuilding the Bozja of old. Blaz was welcomed with open arms, and even offered a position to teach the arts of the samurai. He declined the honor. Though his father had since passed on, Blaz was determined to carry on his legacy. He would join the Resistance and the ranks of Gunnhildr's Blades, swearing an oath to see the nation of Bozja reborn.</p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Velibor Azetina

<p>Race: Hrothgar<br/>
Age: 24<br/>
Birthplace: Zetina's Grace, Bozja<br/>
<br/>
Velibor is a knight, and second cousin to Blaz. And, like Blaz, he is a direct descendant of the founders of the Verdant Path, an illustrious martial school famous for teaching everything from unarmed combat to swordplay to spear techniques.<br/>
<br/>
This prestigious institution has existed for over two hundred years, and its adherents rose up in strength to defend the city-state of Bozja against the Garlean Empire's incursion. As the invasion rolled on, however, Basch van Gabranth, then legatus of the IVth Legion, grew reluctant at the slaughter of so much promising martial talent. He promised the Verdant Path amnesty and protection, if it would but swear fealty to the Empire. The schoolmaster accepted, and by surrendering himself to the invaders' justice were his disciples spared further bloodshed.<br/>
<br/>
It was Velibor's grandmother who inherited the schoolmaster's mantle, and she upheld Gabranth's pact with unflinching rigidity─tempers would flare and groups would form to rebel against the occupying forces, but any student she caught joining these uprisings was immediately expelled. Thus did the Verdant Path endure. It was on her deathbed, however, that she muttered these words to her successor, Velibor's father: “I have honored our promise to Gabranth, as my husband wished. His sacrifice was an act of love, to ensure that we survived. But you, my son, are not beholden to this oath. A new age is upon us...” <br/>
<br/>
Blaz arrived to find the Verdant Path now aligned with his own purpose, and Velibor discovered in his second cousin a kindred spirit. He remembers their first meeting, and the sense that a missing part of his soul had returned. Indeed, Velibor felt his distant relative more a brother in truth. Within a short while, they were engaged in friendly rivalry, their mutual encouragement leading to the invention of new martial techniques.<br/>
<br/>
Even as their companionship blossomed, the school took steps to formalize its allegiance to the Bozjan Resistance, and Velibor, along with some few dear comrades, was invited to join the vaunted Gunnhildr's Blades. This day, as on every other, is his greatsword poised to fall upon the oppressors of his people.</p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Aggie Glover

<p>Race: Hyur<br/>
Age: 17<br/>
Birthplace: Martrvje, Bozja<br/>
<br/>
An ancient and diverse settlement home to some two hundred thousand inhabitants, the Bozjan harbor city of Martrvje draws in laborers from malms around with the promise of plentiful employment. Yet despite its prosperity, this haven also shelters its fair share of vagrants and orphans. Whether it be through war, illness, or imprisonment at the hands of authorities, many are the children who lose their parents to unfortunate circumstance and end up huddled beneath the streets in sewers and drainage tunnels. Aggie had been one such child. <br/>
<br/>
She never knew her parents, nor the name she was given at birth. “Aggie” was what the imperial clerks chose to call her on that brutal winter's day when they first found the five-year-old shivering outside, alone and half-frozen. <br/>
<br/>
She claims to have little memory of the time before she was rescued, aside from the taste of zefir─a sweet marshmallow confectionery which remains her favorite food. She has no recollection of where or with whom she lived. Back then, she seemed unable or unwilling to even speak. <br/>
<br/>
The clerks took the silent Aggie to be raised at the illustrious Verdant Path, a school of martial learning. And her transformation was nothing short of miraculous─the dead-eyed, listless child that was taken in from the cold came to life in the company of her classmates. She showed an incredible aptitude for reading and writing, devouring every scrap of wisdom her instructors set before her. Before long, she had blossomed into a young girl full of smiles and affection, her cheerful mood never failing to brighten a room. <br/>
<br/>
Blaz and Velibor were the two with whom Aggie felt the most connected. Determined not to be outdone by their martial prowess, she devoted herself to the study of fist-fighting, and through a combination of hard work and natural talent, rose to the rank of master by her sixteenth nameday. <br/>
<br/>
When her battle brothers left to join the Resistance, she would not be left behind. And there in the muddy camps, amongst soldiers prone to fits of despair or fury, Aggie was once again a welcome ray of sunshine. She became their living banner, a rallying presence on the field. They cheered when she was selected for Gunnhildr's Blades, Blaz and Velibor loudest of all, but she suspected Bajsaljen had based his decision more on politics than merit. Still, she saw no point in provoking argument. Aggie would continue as she always had, fighting the good fight and lifting the morale of her comrades. </p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Hernais pyr Longus

<p>Race: Hyur<br/>
Age: 24<br/>
Birthplace: Mons Falconis, Landis<br/>
<br/>
When Hernais first enlisted in the legions, he shared the midland marshals' unfavorable impression of Lyon rem Helsos. The Beast King's tactics were unconventional and unpredictable, subject to sudden changes as he surveyed the shifting tides of battle─certainly no such rough-and-tumble strategy was taught at any officer academy. The man himself was uncouth in word and appearance, and apparently preferred the company of creature to man. They dismissed him as they would any borderland barbarian. <br/>
<br/>
Hernais's opinion was flipped on its head, however, when he witnessed Lyon's handling of the insurrection in Dalmasca four years ago. While it was true the Beast King spoke brusquely, he knew each of his subordinates by name, and was well versed in their strengths and weaknesses. When battle was joined, he did not lead from the rear─indeed, he was often the first to leap into the fray. “Only the weak perish” was his constant refrain, and the young officer saw the truth of his words as the inept and the cowardly fell in droves before the strong. <br/>
<br/>
Lyon's strategy sent his pets to the front lines to die in place of soldiers, and, while initially bemused, Hernais came to understand the man's fondness for the beasts. He doted upon them like children that might not wake to see the morrow, cherishing every moment they stalked the boundary ‘twixt life and death. Needing no more convincing of Lyon's savage greatness, Hernais requested placement with the War Beasts that he might serve as his new mentor's herald. <br/>
<br/>
The following is an excerpt from Curious, the Mons Falconis town gazette. <br/>
<br/>
Reporter: Your comrades in the IVth Legion have dubbed you the “Tenacious” and compare you to some well-trained cur. Do you take umbrage at being so described? <br/>
<br/>
Hernais: I care not. They are simply envious. <br/>
<br/>
Reporter: And what makes you think that? <br/>
<br/>
Hernais: Most of these fools can scarce hide their ambition. They smile and scrape and follow orders, while inside they chafe at the indignity. <br/>
<br/>
Reporter: A soldier must do as a superior commands, but is not a brief flicker of defiance only natural...? <br/>
<br/>
Hernais: Not for me. Not anymore. With the whole of my heart, with the entirety of my soul, do I walk the trail of the Beast King. Let them mock my name! I accept it as a badge of honor, and may none question my loyalty! <br/>
<br/>
–-<br/>
<br/>
Reporter: ...So spake pyr Longus. Have you any comments for your subordinate, sir? <br/>
<br/>
Lyon: To be honest, I'd completely forgotten the boy until you shared that story just now. Ah, yes, he's an eager little bastard─like a terrier! All fury and gnashing teeth! Pity that type doesn't last long amongst the big dogs. <br/>
<br/>
Reporter: I...er...thank you for your time.</p>

[BOZJA NOTE]

Clarricie quo Priscus

<p>Race: Elezen<br/>
Age: 33<br/>
<br/>
Notorious among both friend and foe for her ostentatious presence on the battlefield, the true nature of this centurion of the IVth Imperial Legion's contingent of beasts remains shrouded in mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Two facts are certain: Clarricie joined the ranks of the IVth Imperial Legion some ten years ago, and is one of the few beastmasters recognized for her talents by the “Beast King” Lyon rem Helsos. Beyond this, countless stories are told. Some call her a witch, saying they have observed her speaking to her pets in unholy, bestial tongues the likes of which have never been uttered by mortal mouths─indeed, that the monstrosities in her charge obey her every command because she herself is one of them. Others claim this is but a lie spread by those looking to smear her name, and that Clarricie is rather a saint, a figure of surpassing compassion and charity who tends to her wounded pets and comrades with self-sacrificing love and devotion, fighting to protect them as if she were the warrior goddess Gradia herself.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps both tales are true, and whether Clarricie appears as a witch or a saint depends only on the eye of the beholder. What cannot be denied are the nigh-countless triumphs she has claimed in war, and the profound fear she strikes into the heart of any foe unfortunate enough to meet her dangerously alluring gaze on the battlefield.<br/>
<br/>
Little is known about her origins, save that she was born as one of the Eschva, a nomadic people that wandered across borders in the olden days. When the Empire came, they refused to settle, leading Legatus Gabranth to propose a compromise: they could maintain their itinerant lifestyle on the condition that they volunteered a dictated number of their strongest men to serve in the imperial army for a fixed period of time. The Eschva accepted these terms, and Clarricie's newlywed husband was one of those chosen to serve. A formidable beastmaster in his own right, he was recruited into Lyon's contingent, but tragically and suddenly lost his life on his very first mission─just months after he and Clarricie swore their vows. Feeling a strong sense of responsibility and pity for the poor girl, Lyon personally paid her a visit in Gabranth's stead, apologizing for causing her beloved's death under his watch. Lamenting the thought of any other Eschva women being widowed as she had been, she entreated Lyon to accept her into his ranks in her husband's place, a petition which the Beast King was all too happy to accept. Since that day, Clarricie wears the masks of both a witch and a saint, fighting for her husband's honor and memory, and to achieve an era of peace for her people that her beloved will never see...</p>

Ketenramm Blaufystsyn

<p>In the year 1497 of the Sixth Astral Era, a Lominsan Sea Wolf explorer of not twenty summers plotted a westward course for Hingashi, embarking on a fateful voyage that would catapult him into the ranks of legend. Unbeknownst to him and his crew, a great continent lay between them and the Far East─and it was not the splendor of Kugane, but the shores of Tural that ultimately lay upon the horizon.<br/>
<br/>
Having made landfall, Ketenramm roamed the interior, ultimately reaching Mamook, the vast home of the Mamool Ja. There he met then-Autarch Gulool Ja Ja, with whom he struck up a firm friendship. Together, the pair ranged the length and breadth of Tural, spurred on by the same adventurous spirit that led the old sailor to this mysterious isle.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

The Phantom Village

<p>Perched upon the eastern tip of the Occult Crescent, this compact settlement is deathly silent, save for the gentle sluicing of the plaza fountain. Though its stone structures are weathered and overgrown, the orderly state of the town implies a degree of active preservation by some unknown hand. In the harbor, the forlorn wrecks of outbound ships are a testament to the fearsome reputation Shades' Triangle commands.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

The Archive

<p>Although identical in form to those gruesome figures of legend, the tonberries, the Archive is unquestionably rational and possessing of a friendly─if occasionally boastful─demeanor. He pledged to join Ketenramm's expedition soon after being roused from his sarcophagus in the phantom village, though it remains to be seen whether he will prove a useful asset, as the "wise old man" struggles to recall most of his allegedly nigh-infinite knowledge─a result of lingering grogginess from his lengthy slumber, or some other arcane process?</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

Iris

<p>This ethereal familiar appeared shortly after the Archive's awakening, claiming authoritatively that the man's wisdom was sealed away and can only be accessed where it concerns matters that the Warrior of Light has witnessed firsthand. When pressed about her own purpose, however, she too confessed ignorance. Compounding the mystery, the Archive senses the same aether that envelops the isle emanating from the faerie─could her master be the unseen hand presiding over the Occult Crescent?</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

The Expedition Base Camp

<p>Nestled within the ruins of an old fortification, the encampment is an ideal location from which to stage forays into the South Horn of the island, while the surrounding walls offer sufficient protection from nearby fiends. The focal point of the camp is a device indistinguishable from an aetheryte that ought to facilitate swift travel on the island. Intriguingly, these ruins exhibit a different architectural style to that of the phantom village, though when and by whom they were first built is yet to be determined.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

Phantom Jobs

<p>During the course of the expedition, the Archive uncovered crystalline objects containing the distilled knowledge of ancient martial methods. Known as "soul shards," these fragments allow the bearer to wield an array of long-forgotten techniques. According to the scholar-turned-tonberry, the crystals will cease to function upon leaving the Occult Crescent, thus limiting their efficacy to the isle. Nonetheless, they should prove a boon when dealing with its more combative fauna.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

The Lost Citadel

<p>This rough-hewn stone fortress looks to have stood for centuries past its abandonment by the original occupants─though its vaulted corridors now echo with the restless prowling of more monstrous denizens. Architecturally, the rhomboid motifs and cavernous central dome bear a striking similarity to the Amdapori ruins discovered in the Twelveswood. The presence of multiple stone guardians also implies some relation to ancient Amdapor.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

Trade Tortoise

<p>This hulking reptilian possesses a modicum of intelligence, not to mention a rudimentary grasp of the common tongue, and will attempt to sell its wares to anyone foolish enough to draw near. Those who would engage in business with the craven beast should note that these trinkets are invariably cursed. This predilection for curses hints at some connection with the city of Skalla, which once prospered in Gyr Abania─though why anyone would summon such a troublesome familiar remains a mystery.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

The Vanishing Slope

<p>Stretching from the southern tip of the island, this stony beach overlooks the bay formed by the crescent, and on clear days, a bifurcated tower can be seen shimmering, mirage-like, in the distance. The weathered ruins clustered on the shore bear similarities with the phantom village─namely, the inverse conical style favored in Nym, an ancient city-state that flourished upon present-day Vylbrand. The rounded central plaza and overarching layout of the ruins suggest this was a location of religious or spiritual significance.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[OCCULT RECORD]

Nymian Petalodus

<p>Nymian legend speaks of the petalodus, a shark from which sprouts two ambulatory limbs. Naturalists long decried the idea as laughable, asserting that the myth is based on a real species of shark that uses its fins to traverse the seabed, as if walking. This notion itself was eventually disputed when credible reports of the limbed shark began to flood in.<br/>
<br/>
As if its very existence was not strange enough, a curious rumor surrounds the creature: allegedly, the petalodus will resist the temptation to devour any fleshy morsel it identifies as a friend. Individual attempts to verify said rumor have thus far ended predictably.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

Whom the Silkie Serves

<p>What a surprise to learn that the old palace silkie was a creation of Mother's! The discovery impelled me to pursue the topic with Papashan, who, of anyone besides Father, knew my mother best of all. Naturally, I was circumspect in my inquiries, lest he become aware of my subterranean explorations. <br/>
With fond remembrance, Papashan spoke of Mother's penchant for cleaning─a habit she refused to surrender even after taking up residence in the royal chambers. Her ladies-in-waiting were positively scandalized, and hid away every brush and broom that the sultana's hands not be sullied by common grime. Denied the usual tools of sanitation, Mother retaliated by employing a Sharlayan tutor, whereby she acquired the arts necessary to manifest a massive, mouselike familiar. Ingrained with an obsessive dislike of dirt, this arcane entity would even corner the palace guards to scrub spots from their armor─to the great amusement of the household staff. Then one day, without fanfare, the silkie was simply gone.<br/>
I suspect the cause of its disappearance lay in the deepening conflict with the Monetarists; with less and less time to slip away from the palace, Mother likely set her familiar to protect and maintain the secret garden in her absence. Yet what a stubborn and willful soul she was! To create a servant for cleaning is one thing, but to imbue it with such unbridled power is quite another!</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

Pride and Acceptance

<p>With a mind to prepare for future explorations, I began trawling through the palace archives in search of documents with even a tangential mention of Sil'dih. For the most part, however, the shelves held little in the way of new information. The only account to snare my attention was that of an Ul'dahn soldier, who had written of his experiences fighting alongside the Amalj'aa during the zombie purge. His report touched upon the different approach his new allies took to warfare, and how those differences impeded their cooperative efforts.<br/>
It was said that the undead which flooded the waterways were beyond counting, and varied wildly in individual strength. The most effective strategy, or so this soldier believed, was to focus their efforts on the weaker zombies, and thus whittle the horde down to a more manageable size. Not so the Amalj'aa. When presented with the choice, the proud warriors would always seek to slay the mightiest enemies first. This display of superiority, they explained to the exasperated Ul'dahn, was the best way to wage war. To do otherwise─to begin an engagement with the lesser foe─would cast doubt upon one's martial prowess.<br/>
'Twould seem they learned to respect each other's reasoning, yet ultimately fought their battles as their peoples preferred. The Ul'dahn soldier returned to his former tactic, targeting the weakest undead for his initial assaults. An interesting point of culture, mayhap, but a helpful one? That remains to be seen.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

A Spot in the Sunlight

<p>He, a member of the royal family. She, the daughter of a modest merchant house. They met at a palace banquet─an opportunity to mix with the notables of commerce─and it was love at first sight. Ah, I adore that story─'tis so very romantic. Mother would go on to tell me of the secluded place her and Father would visit ere they were bound in marriage; of a sun-dappled garden at the end of a secret tunnel, where they could enjoy each other's company away from prying eyes and judgmental stares. In other words, a perfect description of the sanctuary we discovered on our recent foray.<br/>
When they did at last announce the details of their engagement, the location of this magical place where Father proposed to Mother became the subject of much rumor and debate. I am told that the city's merchants, being the same incorrigible creatures then as they are now, seized upon this furor to turn a tidy profit. They never did come close to the truth of it, but after visiting the spot myself, 'tis easy to see why it has remained undisturbed.<br/>
I imagine the two of them in their younger years, whiling away an idle morning amidst the dawn-kissed petals, their haven protected beneath a barrier of Thanalan's scorching sand, and I cannot help but smile. Never until now have I managed to think of them without a pang of sadness. Have I been captive to grief for so very long...?</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

A Key Memory

<p>On my fifth nameday, my parents gifted me with a key wrought in silver─but not the knowledge of what it opened. “When you are a woman grown, we will take you to the precious place this key protects,” Mother had explained. Father had nodded, saying it was “where slumbers the memories which neither we, nor Ul'dah, should ever forget.” I, a child of five, understood only that I was being forced to wait for my true present. Oh, how I had sulked and fumed back then! Yet now I cling to that fading recollection with desperate fingers, like a failed merchant to her dwindling coinpurse.<br/>
'Twas too soon after when Mother and Father were called away to Thal's eternal halls. Their sudden absence left me hollow and dazed; my ascension to the throne followed by torturous days of uncertainty steeped in sorrow. It seemed I stumbled across the desert, the sands burning one moment, freezing the next. All thoughts of keys and secret places were cast aside, forgotten.<br/>
Why had they entrusted such a portentous gift to a daughter so young? Had they foreseen the “accident” which would befall them? Or had some other factor influenced their actions? Their true intentions are lost to time. There is only one thing I can know for certain: that the key was left in my hands for good reason.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

In Father's Stead

<p>The Amalj'aa constructed Zahar'ak when they came to join Ul'dah in purging the undead infestation from the subterrane. And if Zahar'ak was their main war camp, then the old fortifications we passed through would have served as a forward base. The question, then, is why did my parents gift me the means to visit these rusted defenses? In my late father's possessions was a diary which made reference to “irrefutable evidence of the alliance”─mayhap there is more to the place we have yet to discover.<br/>
In life, Father was a staunch opponent of the edict to banish the so-called “beast tribes.” Arrayed against him were the Monetarists, who sought to preserve their special concessions and privileges by ousting their competitors. 'Twas with the backing of the Syndicate that they overruled the sultan's will, and forced their proposal into law. Unwilling to concede defeat, Father intended to take the battle to the court of public consensus. His weapons would not be easily forged documents or records, but physical proof of the Amalj'aa contribution to Ul'dah's continued prosperity. Then the “accident” happened, ending his plans to appeal for harmony ere they could truly begin.<br/>
Which brings us back to this mention of evidence. I know not what form it might take, or indeed, if it yet even exists, but should a thorough search of that forgotten base provide us with clues... We are on the cusp of brokering a lasting peace with the Amalj'aa─if I can but discover this elusive proof, then the aspirations Father had for our nation may finally become a reality.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

Ul'dah's Sin to Bear

<p>When that Amalj'aa champion burst forth from his casket, the blood nigh froze within my veins. He must have suffered injury during the purge, the zombie corruption finding its way into his flesh...<br/>
The Traders' Spurn was concocted by Ul'dahn thaumaturges, and employed by the reigning sultan during our war with Sil'dih. Sasagan III even knowingly propagated the fiction that it was the Sil'dihns who devised this abhorrent alchemy in an effort to turn their own citizens into undying soldiers. An accusation from the House of Thorne saw Sasagan III later punished for his heinous acts, and thus ended the first Ul Dynasty. His lies, however, would live on to become accepted history.<br/>
This deceit was upheld by a desire to preserve not only the Ul Dynasty's authority, but also the standing of the Order of Nald'thal─an institution deeply entwined with thaumaturgical practices. And it can be said that few Ul'dahns would wish to accept that their home was built upon the corpse of a city so brutally slain by their forebears. Yet without a clear view of the past, we cannot be sure of our course for the future. The sight of that rotting Amalj'aa hero was all too stark a reminder: as a sultana of the House of Ul, I bear responsibility for my ancestor's atrocities. And though we suffer for the truth, even as Ishgard did for hers, the time has come to set the records aright.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

To Learn More of Myrrh

<p>I wished to consult with the Amalj'aa over a certain facet of our expedition, yet I could hardly bring up the subject during one of our regular councils. Should it become known that the royal person had been slipping out of the palace to conduct secret investigations, then my trusted escort would be caught up in an unpleasant storm of repercussions. Nay, I must be discreet.<br/>
As such, I approached the Amalj'aa war chief at meeting's end, and engaged him with the usual empty pleasantries─eventually steering the conversation to tribal custom. I explained that the coffin of a zombie-cursed warrior had been discovered within Ul'dahn territory, and wondered at the traditional rites one might perform to send his kin's unfortunate soul on to the afterlife.<br/>
Somewhat taken aback, the war chief advised that it was of paramount importance to avoid disturbing the warrior's undead slumber. “Leave the coffin untouched,” he warned. “Stand facing the valorous spirit, and perform a single bow. Offer your respects for a life well lived, celebrate the warrior's greatest victory, and then kneel in a moment of reflection.”<br/>
Thus did the Amalj'aa mourn comrades fallen on the field of battle, burning myrrh incense at the culmination of the ritual to guide their sanctified souls unto the everlasting flame.<br/>
In receiving his answer, I was suddenly struck by a cavalcade of questions I had never thought to ask. I felt ashamed at my ignorance, and am now resolved to learn more of this proud people's culture.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

Ul'dah and Sil'dih

<p>When Belah'dia splintered into Ul'dah and Sil'dih, the division only deepened with time. The history books tell the tale of escalating hostilities; of how the advent of the Traders' Spurn devastated the Sil'dihns, and brought the conflict to a horrific end. Ul'dah would later migrate to the site of the fallen metropolis, where even now the ruins of the past dot the landscape, or lie hidden from view deep underground. Such remnants proved useful when routing the municipal waterways, and so did they refer to this section of the subterrane as the “Sil'dihn aqueducts.” Given that the war turned savage over water sources, it seems to me a designation of particularly ghoulish sensibilities.<br/>
Distasteful naming aside, it should have come as no surprise that these old tunnels fed into other vestiges of Sil'dih. And yet I was wholly unprepared to set foot in the royal palace itself! Had the structure been exposed above ground, the wind-driven sand coupled with the heat of the Thanalan sun would have led to extensive erosion. But cocooned beneath the earth as it was, its chambers have been perfectly preserved.<br/>
How rare it must be to encounter ruins in such an unspoiled state. It will provide our historians with a wealth of material to study...assuming they can navigate the intervening passages. We must clear the way, first and foremost, and secure a safe path through.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

Raising the Flags

<p>When we came across the banner of Sil'dih, so alike to our Ul'dahn flag, I was reminded that the first sultans of those warring nations were twin brothers. Yet the reason behind the design's similarity has naught to do with sibling imitation. In Belah'dia's time, 'twas the Flame of Magic and the Fruit of Knowledge which sat the scales of judgment. Ul'dah took the Flame as its own, balancing the scales with the Gem of Affluence, whilst Sil'dih claimed the Fruit, and set it against the Helm of Might. Each thought himself the rightful heir, and thus did both raise flags depicting the bounties of Belah'dia.<br/>
Both included a symbol of strength, but the difference lay in its interpretation: Ul'dah believed in the potency of its magicks; Sil'dih, in its military might. The gladiators who train in our Coliseum are mayhap the closest embodiment of Sil'dihn philosophy. <br/>
In fact, reflecting on the encounter now, the fierce gladiator construct lurking in the palace depths could not have been a more apt incarnation of their beliefs: from the exquisite embossment of grapes upon its formidable helm, to the way its gleaming form─the same silvery hue as Sil'dih's scales─illuminated the subterranean gloom. Through all these years did it stand patient guard, faithfully serving a master centuries dead, and a nation long since fallen into ruin. 'Tis enough to turn one's mood melancholy.</p>





---------------------------------------------------------------------
[VARIANT DUNGEON]

My Mother's Eyes

<p>How, in the name of the Nald'thal, did that burglar manage to creep into a treasure chamber sealed off from the outside world for generations? Aside from the gate only my key could open, I saw no other means of entering the ruins. Although considering the prevalence of secret doors and passages in its construction, the remnants may very well have other entrances of which I am simply not aware.<br/>
Yet in spite of this mystery, I find myself lingering most on the scrawled note our thief left behind. The first item was an obvious reference to “Nashachite,” which must somehow relate to one of the ruins' many riddles. 'Tis how it relates to me, however, that truly has my thoughts in a jumble.<br/>
Nashachite was the name Ul'dahn jewelers gave to the high-quality malachite excavated from the reopened Copperbell Mines. This was after the Calamity, of course, and thus I took umbrage at these merchants using my late mother's name as a means to promote their wares.<br/>
And then I was presented with a sample. 'Twas as if the gentle sparkle of Mother's eyes was captured within the stone. Much to my chagrin, I found myself forced to agree that “Nashachite” was the perfect fit for this gem of exquisite green.</p>

Yet, as I mentioned before, hacking away at trees does not make you a botanist. You must also strive to deepen your understanding of nature.<br/>
I say this in the knowledge that you have done just that. Whether you realize it or not, you have the air of a woman who is at ease with the world around her. I do believe you are ready for your next task.<br/>
I would like you to go to Treespeak, and there harvest ten pots' worth of maple sap. Once you have enough, pray deliver the sap to Cicely. She will be pleased to receive it.<br/>
Off you go now, .</p>

<br/>
<h1>CICELY</h1>

<p>On a quest for maple sap? Then your best bet is to search in the vicinity of Treespeak. I happen to be waiting for a delivery of sap myself. Might you be the botanist tasked with supplying it?<br/>
Ah, the maple sap I requested! Then you must be the new botanist Fufucha has been fussing over. Ah, but where are my manners? Thank you!<br/>
Hm? Why do I need so much of the stuff? Well, allow me to explain─it's the very least I can do, after all you've done.<br/>
Boiling maple sap causes it to thicken into a sweet syrup called─aye, you've guessed it─maple syrup.<br/>
From maple syrup we can make maple sugar, an ingredient used in various recipes, particularly confectionery─from cakes and tarts to toffees and chocolates. In short, all the things that children love.<br/>
You've probably guessed it by now, but the maple sap you harvested will be used to make sweets for the children─those poor souls who were orphaned by the Calamity.<br/>
They may put on a brave face, but their eyes reveal the depths of their sorrow. There's precious little joy left in their lives.<br/>
But Gridania hasn't─won't abandon them. No matter your walk of life, there is always something you can do to help. Though it may only last a fleeting moment, a single smile of theirs is worth all the effort.<br/>
...M-My apologies. I got carried away. Now, where was I? Ah, yes.<br/>
In addition to maple sap, we botanists gather various other kinds of foodstuffs. As such, we work quite closely with culinarians, those Disciples of the Hand who excel at cooking. We're also on good terms with woodworkers and weavers, as both are reliant upon us to supply the lumber and fiber they need for their respective crafts.<br/>
As botanists, it behooves us to learn what manner of materials are used in crafting, and there's no better way to do so than firsthand. If you have an interest, you might consider dabbling in one of the disciplines out there.<br/>
I also urge you to make a habit of reviewing the gathering log. As your knowledge of botany grows, more of its contents will become comprehensible to you.<br/>
Well, I'd best see to the maple sap. It was lovely talking to you!</p>

<br/>
<h1>SYSTEM</h1>

<p>For every fifth level you reach as a botanist, you will gain the ability to detect higher-level mature trees and lush vegetation. When this occurs, any new items that are available through gathering will be added to your gathering log.<br/>
You can use the Arbor Call botanist action to help you locate the nearest mature tree or lush vegetation within your skill range.</p>

Weapons of a Feather

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>Ah, . You couldn't have come at a more opportune time. I have a favor to ask of you.<br/>
We have just received an urgent request from the Order of the Twin Adder. They ask that we supply them with ten crow feathers as soon as possible.<br/>
Crows often leave behind feathers where they perch, which can be used to make arms and armor.<br/>
Requests for the items have been coming in with increasing regularity. The situation must be grim indeed.<br/>
It would not do to keep the defenders of our nation waiting. I would be most glad if you could help us fulfill this order.<br/>
Crow feathers can be found in abundance in the area south of Gilbert's Spire.<br/>
Once you have procured ten, promptly deliver them to Cicely. I've given her charge over our stores. My thanks in advance.</p>

<br/>
<h1>CICELY</h1>

<p>You're helping us out again? My thanks, friend. In case you've forgotten, the crow feathers can be found in the area south of Gilbert's Spire.<br/>
Ah, the crow feathers! You have my thanks.<br/>
Doubtless you already know this from Fufucha, but it's the Order of the Twin Adder that requested the feathers.<br/>
If I heard it true, they're in the midst of preparing for war against the Ixal. The crow feathers are needed to make arms and armor─feathered harpoons, plumed yew crooks, and the like.<br/>
It's a fine feeling, being able to do our part to aid those men and women who defend our nation.<br/>
But to need such a large stockpile of feathers... It gives me pause to imagine the bloodshed that lies ahead. Will the Twelveswood ever know true peace?<br/>
Oh, but there I go again with my wistful ramblings. Feel free to ignore me.<br/>
Now, before I forget, Fufucha asked me to give you something on her behalf: a scythe.<br/>
The scythe is what we call a secondary tool. Used in your off hand, it allows you to harvest from lush vegetation in addition to the mature trees you already know so well.<br/>
That Fufucha has seen fit to make you this gift is proof positive of your progress. You're no longer a novice, my friend. I daresay you're ready to try your hand at fieldcraft leves, perhaps even take on Grand Company work.<br/>
But first, I recommend you head into the wood and find some lush vegetation to try that new scythe on. Off you go now, and come back when you're ready to take on another task for the guild!</p>

Haste Makes Waste

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>Ah, my dear . You are looking ever more a botanist. I do believe you are ready to take on further responsibilities for the guild.<br/>
Guilds such as ours exist only by virtue of the cooperation of their members. Each individual must set an example for the rest if the collective is to thrive. The time has come for you to set just such an example.<br/>
A matter has arisen, the handling of which I would entrust wholly to you. You may deal with it as you see fit, providing you see the problem solved.<br/>
The matter in question concerns a valued client of ours─the merchant Albgast. It would appear one of our number has done something to upset him.<br/>
Pray seek out the merchant at the Ebony Stalls and inquire after the reason for his ire. Oh, and choose your words well, lest you add fuel to the fire.</p>

<br/>
<h1>ALBGAST</h1>

<p>Fufucha sent you, did she? Good. I'm not a man to mince words, so forgive me if I seem blunt.<br/>
You know what marjoram is? But of course you do─you're a bleeding botanist! It's a very common ingredient in alchemy, isn't it? Very common.<br/>
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you botanists supposed to be the experts in harvesting such stuff? Yes, you are. Strange, then, that the expert who brought me my last batch of fresh marjoram didn't so much harvest the poor plants as dismember them!<br/>
Why, the leaves were so torn up, I couldn't recognize what they were at first. Needless to say, they're next to useless.<br/>
So, thanks to your herb-hacking colleague, I have no marjoram to make my concoctions. Which is why I inquired at your guild─only to be told you were out of supplies. And here we are.<br/>
Now, if it ain't too much trouble, I would be obliged if you could bring me ten sprigs of fresh marjoram. And I'd please like them whole, as opposed to the fine bleeding purée your bush-butchering colleague delivered.<br/>
Truth be told, I don't much care about your hatchet-happy friend. What I do care about is not keeping my customers waiting for their medicine. In short: hurry.<br/>
Oh, and for the love of the gods, be gentle with the plants, will you? I shouldn't have to say it, but after the last bloke, I'm not taking any chances.<br/>
Did you get the marjoram? The herb is said to grow around the Matron's Lethe, though I hardly need to tell a botanist this. Do hurry─I'm keeping dozens of customers waiting.<br/>
Ah, the marjoram! And such fine specimens! I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time, friend. Thanks to you, I can get back to making echo drops.<br/>
Do you know of echo drops? They are an alchemical concoction that restores voice to silenced lips, allowing the imbiber to cast spells again. Conjurers and thaumaturges never leave home without a bottle or three.<br/>
But I must say again, these are some of the finest specimens of marjoram I've seen, and they're none the worse for the picking. It's clear you know your way around a plant.<br/>
As for your colleague with the heavy hand, I'm certain your guild will deal with him appropriately. Thanks again, and send my regards to Fufucha.</p>

<br/>
<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>Ah, there you are. Thank you for a job well done. There's no need to report the details─I have already heard all I need to know.<br/>
It is my belief that the botanist in question had naught but personal gain in mind when he so hurriedly harvested the marjoram. In his haste to complete the task and claim its reward, he damaged the herbs and rendered them useless.<br/>
Such greed brings shame on our guild, and I will not tolerate it. The offender's name shall be struck from our roll.<br/>
As I taught you when you first came to us, a botanist nurtures the natural environment to the mutual benefit of man and wood. He who thinks only of his own benefit has no respect for nature and is unfit to call himself one of us.<br/>
Of course, you hardly need reminding of this. Something tells me you shall never give me cause to worry.<br/>
But let us speak of cheerier matters. Tell me, did gathering the marjoram pose you any trouble?<br/>
If you ever find your work unduly onerous, you might consider outfitting yourself with better gear. Even something as seemingly insignificant as a new pair of boots can make a world of difference.<br/>
As you gain in knowledge and experience, you will find yourself venturing farther afield in search of new bounty, and your choice of equipment will become ever more critical.<br/>
Go now, , and keep up your efforts. I look forward to seeing you continue to grow as a botanist.</p>

<br/>
<h1>SYSTEM</h1>

<p>Certain gear grants bonuses to your gathering, perception, and GP values.<br/>
A higher gathering rating improves your chances of obtaining an item; greater perception raises the amount of items obtained; and additional GP increases your extracting stamina.<br/>
Outfitting yourself with an eye to your objectives will increase the efficiency of your gathering endeavors.</p>

Dressed to Harvest

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>Good evening, . I see from the soil on your hands that you have been as diligent as ever in your botany. I am not surprised. As we develop new skills, so do our labors become more varied, and thus does our motivation grow.<br/>
Yet know that motivation can only take one so far. If you wish to master botany, you must pay heed to those details which you have until now taken for granted.<br/>
In particular, I speak of gear─the tools of our trade. Not all tools are created equal, you see, and if you are to work with any degree of efficiency, you must use such gear as befits your ability.<br/>
Lest you misunderstand, I am not telling you to go and replace your gear. There is a more frugal way to improve your tools─and one more respectful to nature besides.<br/>
Tell me, have you heard of materia? It is a kind of crystal that can be used to enhance the efficacy of gear. In the past, the enhancement process required certain catalysts found throughout nature, the gathering of which was our domain, but new methods have rendered them obsolete.<br/>
Be that as it may, these substances still make for ideal subjects of training for budding botanists such as yourself. Therefore, for your next task, I would like you to gather a quantity of one such catalyst, namely grade 1 carbonized matter. Fifteen fragments should suffice.<br/>
A thorough search of the area surrounding Aleport will surely prove fruitful. The hamlet lies in western La Noscea, upon the island of Vylbrand. Once you have gathered the requisite amount, pray present the carbonized matter to Sandre. He will teach you the basics of materia.</p>

<br/>
<h1>SANDRE</h1>

<p>Fufucha sent you to learn about materia, you say? Very well, bring me fifteen fragments of grade 1 carbonized matter, and we'll talk.<br/>
It seems Fufucha has high hopes for you. Very well, let us speak of materia.<br/>
The art of crafting with materia is yet new to Eorzea. It was borne to our shores by a goblin scholar named Mutamix some few years ago.<br/>
Put simply, the process begins with extracting materia from old gear. This is then attached to another piece of gear, enhancing the item's properties.<br/>
Mind you, it's not as if any half-wit can do the attaching. No, it takes a skilled craftsman with the necessary knowledge and experience.<br/>
And once, the process also required substances known as catalysts. The carbonized matter you've gathered is one such substance.<br/>
But then they discovered a way to attach materia without the stuff, and we botanists are a little more idle for it. Such is the way of progress.<br/>
And that, my friend, is materia in brief. Now, I'd thank you not to ask me about the workings of it─that sort of scholarly stuff is beyond my fathoming. If you wish to know more─perhaps even try your hand at crafting with materia─I suggest you seek out the goblin Mutamix. It's said he has his camp at a place called the Bonfire, out in the wilds of central Thanalan.<br/>
Oh, and keep in mind that materia comes in a great many varieties, each granting unique benefits to the gear it's attached to. I daresay you'll lose count of all the kinds you come across on your adventures.<br/>
If I were you, I'd try to find a craftsman who'd be willing to attach materia for me. Chances are there's such a person among your list of acquaintances.</p>

Aromatic Aspirations

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>As Gridania continues to make headway along the road to recovery, ever more outsiders shall flock to her gates.<br/>
They come here in hopes of trading, and Gridania must welcome them if she is to forge stronger bonds with her neighbors and prosper. Make no mistake, , busy times lie ahead.<br/>
Verily, we have just now received an order for no fewer than two thousand fine-quality sprigs of chamomile from the Quicksand in Ul'dah. So run along and harvest them, would you?<br/>
...I jest, of course! A task of this scale will require more than two hands. If you would be so good as to procure, say, fifteen sprigs, I would consider it an appropriate contribution.<br/>
Chamomile is well known for its fragrant aroma and soothing properties. There is satisfaction to be had in ensuring that folk from every corner of the realm can sample the delights of this great staple, do you not agree?<br/>
The herb is abundant in upper La Noscea, around Oakwood to be precise. Once you have harvested fifteen sprigs, pray deliver them to Sandre.</p>

<br/>
<h1>SANDRE</h1>

<p>So Fufucha has you harvesting chamomile as well, does she? Return here when you have fifteen sprigs, and I'll add them to the pile. While you harvest, I shall ponder how in the seven hells I'm supposed to ship them all...<br/>
...thirteen, fourteen, fifteen! Aye, precisely fifteen sprigs of chamomile. My thanks, friend.<br/>
<sniff> Ahhh, that distinct aroma! There's nothing like chamomile tea to calm the nerves. It's the perfect way to end the day, I reckon.<br/>
Now all I have to do is wait for your fellow harvesters to bring the rest, pack the lot, and drag it all to the airship landing... <sigh> I expect I will have earned a cup or two of tea when that's done─though I rather suspect it will be the very last thing I fancy.<br/>
I don't know if Fufucha mentioned, but this batch is bound for Ul'dah. It would seem the lords and ladies there have developed a taste for chamomile tea.<br/>
Developed a taste, I said, but like as not they drink it just to impress their neighbors. Wouldn't surprise me one bit if each cup was served on a golden saucer.<br/>
Ack, but there I go again spouting my old prejudices. It's a bad Gridanian habit, I know. Sooner or later, I'll have to get rid of it. Don't want a visiting Ul'dahn to splash hot tea in my face now, do I!? Hah hah hah!</p>

What Nature Giveth

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>I fear we have a situation on our hands, . The guild's crop of alligator pears has been ravaged by vermin─and scarcely a day before the fruit was due to be picked.<br/>
It is disheartening to see our labors come to naught, but such is the way of nature.<br/>
Alas, our woes do not end there. In a fine example of ill timing, no sooner had the disaster come to light than we received an unusually large order for, yes, alligator pears from the Carline Canopy.<br/>
Yet all hope is not lost, for the fruit also grows in the wild. We need but find enough to fulfill the order─fifteen, to be precise.<br/>
Our man Solyeux is charged with keeping track of such produce as may be harvested in the Twelveswood. He spends most of his days around Bentbranch Meadows at this time of year.<br/>
If there are alligator pears out there, he will know where to find them. Pray seek him out, , and do as he directs.</p>

<br/>
<h1>SOLYEUX</h1>

<p>Looking for alligator pears? Aye, I heard the unfortunate tidings. Yet all we can do is take it on the chin and cope as best we can.<br/>
I recommend you search northeast of Quarrymill. Wild alligator pears grow there, and were doing well when I last passed through. Barring pests, they should be ripe for picking right about now.<br/>
Oh, and just so you know, the place you're going is no different from any other untamed corner of the Twelveswood─by which I mean it's full of nasties. Botanists like myself avoid the area if we can help it, but it should be as a walk through a flower garden for an adventurer like you.<br/>
Now, you had best be on your way. Those alligator pears aren't going to pick themselves.<br/>
Like I said, your best bet is to search northeast of Quarrymill. Give the undergrowth thereabouts a good rummage, and you'll find the alligator pears.</p>

<br/>
<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>I trust you now know where alligator pears are found in nature. Please hurry, . It would not do to keep our client waiting.<br/>
Fifteen alligator pears, and just in the nick of time! You have spared us Miounne's wrath.<br/>
Lest you misunderstand, Miounne is a reasonable woman...ordinarily. It is just that much rests upon the fruit's availability. Alligator pears are to form the centerpiece of a new dish of hers, you see, a hearty salad which she has been promoting feverishly to adventurers far and wide.<br/>
Miounne would not have been best pleased had her plans gone awry. But owing to your efforts, she can keep her promise, and we our good reputation. My profoundest thanks, .<br/>
I trust you have learned a valuable lesson from this episode. Namely, that we must not take nature's bounty for granted.<br/>
As I taught you when first you came to us, nature is an unsentimental creature. She may provide for our every need today, only to take it all away on the morrow.<br/>
Those who would walk the path of botany must come to terms with this fact, and the sooner the better. For should your labors prove fruitless─and they frequently shall─no amount of brooding will avail you.<br/>
At such times, one must remember that for all her seeming cruelty, nature is not our enemy. She simply is. If you would become intimate with her and partake of her bounty, you must learn to accept her unconditionally.</p>

A Feast to Say the Least

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>Ah, . You couldn't have come at a better time. A dear old friend of mine has found herself in a predicament, and is in dire need of a botanist's aid.<br/>
Normally, I would not trouble you with a request of such a personal nature. This task, however, should serve you nicely in your training.<br/>
A contingent of the Gods' Quiver has just returned victorious from a hard-fought battle with the Ixal, and my culinarian friend Yannie has been tasked with overseeing a feast befitting the occasion. Unfortunately, she is suffering an untimely shortage of a key ingredient.<br/>
I would ask you to harvest twenty laurel leaves, which can be found amidst the lush vegetation to the northeast of Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan, then bring them to me for inspection.<br/>
I would ask you to harvest twenty laurel leaves, which can be found amidst the lush vegetation to the northeast of Little Ala Mhigo in southern Thanalan, then bring them to me for inspection.<br/>
Let me see here... Nineteen, twenty...and nary a withered leaf among the lot! Yannie will be pleased as peas.<br/>
Speaking of which, , do you know why laurel is so prized by culinarians across the realm?<br/>
Not only does it boast a most pleasant aroma─deep yet not overpowering, the perfect accent to a savory stew or seasoning for a steak─but it is also known to stimulate the appetite.<br/>
The brave men and women of the Gods' Quiver feast now, but it is only a matter of time before they are summoned back to the field of battle.<br/>
Deliver the laurel to Yannie, that she might prepare a feast that will warm their hearts as well as sate their stomachs.</p>

<br/>
<h1>YANNIE</h1>

<p>Greetings, friend. Are you perchance the botanist to whom Fufucha entrusted my order for laurel?<br/>
Well, I can see why Fufucha is always singing your praises. These will be among the crispest, most aromatic laurel leaves ever to grace my spice rack.<br/>
Ixali raiding parties grow more relentless with each passing day. I fear that the day will soon come when we can no longer afford to feast our men as heartily as we do today.<br/>
Still, Gridania's finest require sustenance as much as they need their lances and bows.<br/>
I am but a simple culinarian, but I would do what I can to support my countrymen. And yet there is only so much I can accomplish on my own.<br/>
In any event, I am grateful for your aid. Pass along my thanks to Fufucha, and let her know that I shall be calling upon your services again.</p>

<br/>
<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>I hear Yannie was overjoyed with your delivery. Thanks to you, she'll be able to prepare a feast befitting the triumphant occasion.<br/>
And yet, truth be told, I take no pleasure in martial victories. Every day that we continue to water the soil with blood, I fear we lose something of what we once were.<br/>
There was a time when Gridanian and Ixal alike lived in harmony with nature, and with each other. Is there no other way to resolve our differences than with lance and arrow?<br/>
Forgive me, . I do not mean to burden you with my troubles.</p>

Crisis of Faith

<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>Oh, good evening, . Forgive me if I seem a bit pensive. If you must know, the thought that our harvests are contributing to the war effort has been weighing heavily on my heart.<br/>
What I truly wish is to be an agent of peace...but what can a humble botanist do? In the meanwhile, another order has come in from Yannie─this time for zucchini, in large quantities.<br/>
No, I am afraid our homegrown harvest simply will not suffice. Fortunately, they are said to grow wild and in abundance in the La Noscea region.<br/>
I would ask you to travel to eastern La Noscea, and harvest twenty of the finest zucchini you can find from the area south of Raincatcher Gully. When you are through, bring them here to me.<br/>
I would ask you to travel to eastern La Noscea, and harvest twenty of the finest zucchini you can find from the area south of Raincatcher Gully. When you are through, bring them here to me.<br/>
What resplendent zucchini! I had no idea such succulent specimens could be found in the wild─truly a testament to the splendor of nature, is it not?<br/>
The zucchini plant is quite sensitive to humidity. One would never see them grow so large and luscious here in the Twelveswood. Furthermore, they are quick to ripen and quicker to rot, meaning that timing is of the essence.<br/>
And yet a perfectly ripe zucchini is truly a thing of beauty. Sweet enough to be savored raw, its skin retains a pleasantly firm texture even when stewed.<br/>
I suppose Yannie means to prepare a wholesome and hearty feast for our soldiers. <sigh> I know. I should take pride in serving our nation this way. But I have troubled you enough. Take your harvest to Yannie with my blessing.</p>

<br/>
<h1>YANNIE</h1>

<p>Fufucha assured me my twenty zucchini were on their way. Might you be the one who took the order?<br/>
Why, what remarkable zucchini! I've not seen the likes of these in quite some time. At the risk of sounding boastful, I daresay that my next batch of ratatouille is shaping up to be the tastiest Gridania has ever seen!<br/>
Ratatouille is a dish that holds a special place in my heart. It was the first recipe I learned, you see, taught to me by none other than Fufucha's own mother.<br/>
My father was a traveling merchant, and our family moved often when I was young. I had few friends until we moved here to Gridania, where I befriended Fufucha.<br/>
Hours would I spend by her side as she rooted through her garden. After sunset, we would go inside, where her mother would whip up a ratatouille that truly warmed both body and soul. Ah, to relive those days... Wait a minute! I have an idea!<br/>
This is the ratatouille that inspired me to pursue the culinarian's path from such a young age. Do take a bowl to Fufucha─it seems she could use something to pick up her spirits these days.</p>

<br/>
<h1>FUFUCHA</h1>

<p>I thank you for delivering the zucchini to Yannie. <sigh> I suppose she is already slaving over a hot stove, preparing a stew that will give our warriors the stamina to fight yet another─ What's that? Yannie has something for me?<br/>
Why, this... This is my mother's ratatouille! I always knew that Yannie loved this recipe, but I had no idea she had learned to reproduce it to such succulent perfection!<br/>
Ah, this brings me back to the old days! Yes, things were so much simpler then... Now, the ratatouille that once warmed our hearts after hours spent frolicking in the garden serves to light a fire in the bellies of those who march off to war. Will things never again be as they were?</p>
